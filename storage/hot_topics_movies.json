        "content": "Just thinking about the 90s recently. Twister for example is a big budget film starring a guy used to supporting roles in James Cameron films and a popular tv star. No legit A-listers yet it was a hit because the story was enough. Sure, maybe if Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks were in it, it may have been a bigger hit or maybe folks would buy it less with the performances.\n\nAlso, Starship Troopers which had a 100 million dollar budget back in 1997 and was R-rated and had no stars whatsoall unless you count Doogie Howser. I gotta imagine that was a risky move selling it to the studio yet it was made.\n\nWhat are some other big budget films that have practically no stars in the lead role?",

However, watching Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, Kevin never told his family that he fought Harry and Marv in the events covered by the first movie. \n\nAll throughout the second film, his family only ever describes him as being left alone during Christmas\u2014never once do they refer to the fact that he fought off two thieves while he was home alone. The only witness to Kevin fighting the thieves was the old man with the snow shovel. One would think that he would have discussed the ordeal with Kevin\u2019s parents. \n\nIt begs the question why Kevin and the neighbor withheld this information from Kevin\u2019s family. A plot hole? Or, alternatively, is there a possibility that Kevin hallucinated the entire events of the first and second films? \n\nEdit: Thanks for all the responses. I am going to be more careful about labeling things as plot holes in the future. Merry Christmas ya\u2019 filthy animals. ",

It will be criticized by the audience and critics, but in the future it will be considered a good film. It doesn't matter how long it takes from now on.\n\nP.S. English isn't my native language",

        "content": "Hello there,\n\nyesterday, I've asked you for your most favorite movie set in North Macedonia, and although there weren't really that many suggestions and votes, we were still able to find an interesting winner: ***You Won't Be Alone*** is an australian movie. To be honest, I'm still trying to figure out why an Australian filmmaker made a movie with a plot set in North Macedonia, but maybe I'll get back to this as soon as I've found out more (after the viewing).\n\nBut what I would like to find out very quickly is your favorite movie set in **Norway**. I think this time a movie that is genuinely from the country itself could end up on [our official letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) list again, but we'll see... The only thing I'm setting here are just two rules:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\n&gt;Day 34: North Macedonia - You Won\u2019t Be Alone\n\n&gt;Day 33: Netherlands - Zwartboek (engl.: Black Book)\n\n&gt;Day 32: Montenegro - Igla Ispod Praga (engl.: The Black Pin)\n\n&gt;Day 31: Monaco - La fille de Monaco (engl.: The Girl from Monaco)\n\n&gt;Day 30: Moldova - Carbon\n\n&gt;Day 29: Malta - Luzzu\n\n&gt;Day 28: Luxembourg - L\u00e4if a S\u00e9il (engl.: The Last Ashes)\n\n&gt;Day 27: Lithuania -Vaikai i\u0161 Amerikos vie\u0161bu\u010dio (engl.: The Children from the Hotel America)\n\n&gt;Day 26: Liechtenstein - Kinder der Berge\n\n&gt;Day 25: Latvia - Krimin\u0101l\u0101s ekselences fonds (engl.: The Foundation of Criminal Excellence)\n\n&gt;Day 24: Kosovo - Zgjoi (engl.: Hive)\n\n&gt;Day 23: Italy - Nuovo Cinema Paradiso (engl.: Cinema Paradiso)\n\n&gt;Day 22: Ireland - The Wind That Shakes the Barley\n\n&gt;Day 21: Iceland - Englar Alheimsins (engl.: Angels of the Universe)\n\n&gt;Day 20: Hungary - S\u00e1t\u00e1ntang\u00f3\n\n&gt;Day 19: Greece - \u039a\u03c5\u03bd\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 (engl.: Dogtooth)\n\n&gt;Day 18: Germany - Das Leben der Anderen (engl.: The Lives of Others)\n\n&gt;Day 17: Georgia - \u10ea\u10d8\u10e1\u10e4\u10d4\u10e0\u10d8 \u10db\u10d7\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8 \u10d0\u10dc\u10e3 \u10d3\u10d0\u10e3\u10ef\u10d4\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d4\u10da\u10d8 \u10d0\u10db\u10d1\u10d0\u10d5\u10d8 (engl.: Blue Mountains)\n\n&gt;Day 16: France - La Haine\n\n&gt;Day 15: Finland - Mies vailla menneisyytt\u00e4 (engl.: The Man Without a Past)\n\n&gt;Day 14: Estonia - Vehkleja (engl.: The Fencer)\n\n&gt;Day 13: Denmark - Jagten (engl.: The Hunt)\n\n&gt;Day 12: Czechia - Spalova\u010d mrtvol (engl.: The Cremator)\n\n&gt;Day 11: Cyprus - Smuggling Hendrix\n\n&gt;Day 10: Croatia - Kako je po\u010deo rat na mome otoku (engl.: How the War Started on My Island)\n\n&gt;Day 9: Bulgaria - \u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0435\u0441\u0438\u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0435\u0441\u0438 (engl.: Eastern Plays)\n\n&gt;Day 8: Bosnia and Herzegovina - Ni\u010dija zemlja (engl.: No Man's Land)\n\n&gt;Day 7: Belgium - In Bruges\n\n&gt;Day 6: Belarus - \u0418\u0434\u0438 \u0438 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438 (engl.: Come and See)\n\n&gt;Day 5: Azerbaijan - Yuxu (engl.: The Dream)\n\n&gt;Day 4: Austria - Funny Games\n\n&gt;Day 3: Armenia - \u0546\u057c\u0561\u0576 \u0563\u0578\u0582\u0575\u0576\u0568 (engl.: The Color of Pomegranates)\n\n&gt;Day 2: Andorra - El fred que crema (engl.: The Burning Cold)\n\n&gt;Day 1: Albania - Lulekuq\u00ebt mbi Mure (engl.: Red Poppies on Walls)\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;",

        "content": "**Moana 2**\n\n* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/moana_2) 69% (72 Reviews)\n\n&gt;Riding high on a wave of stunning animation even when its story runs adrift, Moana 2 isn't as inspired as the original but still delights as a colorful adventure.\n\n* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/moana-2/):  57 (36 Reviews)\n\n**Reviews**\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/moana-2-review-disney-dwayne-johnson-aulii-cravalho-1236070676/):\n\n&gt;Where Moana focused on the relationship between the titular adventurer and her reluctant demigod companion, Moana 2 divides its attention among more characters. These personalities become window dressing in a movie short on time.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/moana-2-review-dwayne-johnson-auli-i-cravalho-1236222936/):\n\n&gt;Moana 2 is an okay movie, an above-average kiddie roller-coaster, and a piece of pure product in a way that the first \u201cMoana,\u201d at its best, transcended.\n\n[Daily Telegraph] (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/moana-2-review-dwayne-johnson/) (4/5):\n\n&gt;With a running time that brings us briskly ashore, the film is a grand voyage in miniature -- a taster epic.\n\n[Empire] (https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/moana-2/) (4/5):\n\n&gt;A touch less fresh than the original, but this is still bursting with energy, emotion, warmth and imagination. It knows the way. \n\n[USA Today] (https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/11/26/moana-2-disney-review-release/76466003007/) (3/4):\n\n&gt;The follow-up plots an extremely familiar course but at least does so with fresh new personalities and more inspired Pacific Island influence.\n\n[IndieWire] (https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/moana-2-review-disney-sequel-1235069079/) (B):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s always a tough ask to improve upon an original, but \u201cMoana 2\u201d is a sprightly addition to this sea-faring legacy. It does something nearly impossible in our sequel-glutted world: made me want further adventures.\n\n[Slashfilm] (https://www.slashfilm.com/1723102/disney-moana-2-review/) (7/10):\n\n&gt;Fortunately, much like \"Frozen II,\" \"The Incredibles 2,\" and \"Toy Story 4,\" we may not have needed a sequel, but at least the one we got is enjoyable and manages to actually push the story forward.\n\n[Total Film] (https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/animation-movies/moana-2-review/) (3.5/5):\n\n&gt;Moana remains as compelling a protagonist as ever in her much-anticipated sequel, whilst her reunion with Maui showcases the wonderful voice talents of Auli\u2019i Cravalho and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. There\u2019s plenty to admire in the animation and rich mythology of the tale, but it rehashes many of the themes and plot points of the original leading to a fun but less vital movie.\n\n[AV Club] (https://www.avclub.com/moana-2-review) (C+):\n\n&gt;A ramshackle Franken-ship ... with more in common with straight-to-video sequels than the clever original.\n\n[Rolling Stone] (https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/moana-2-review-disney-1235175741/):\n\n&gt;The overall sentiment seems to be something like Sequel 101: You loved the first movie, so here\u2019s a second movie that\u2019s a lot like the first movie. This is the good news if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after. If not, well: It\u2019s one hour and 40 minutes.\n\n[BBC] (https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20241126-moana-2-review) (3/5):\n\n&gt;Despite all this Moana moaning, though, it's still a high-quality piece of work: a hurtling Disneyland rollercoaster ride that small children, especially, are bound to enjoy. The irony is that if it had been a television series, viewers might well have gushed about how spectacular it was. But as a film, Moana 2 wouldn't be near the top of any list of Disney's finest.\n\n[IGN] (https://www.ign.com/articles/moana-2-review-disney-dwayne-johnson-aulii-cravalho) (6/10):\n\n&gt;While some of the elements still manage to get a laugh here, the world we were introduced to eight years ago doesn\u2019t feel richer or more exciting.\n\n[Screen Rant] (https://screenrant.com/moana-2-movie-review/) (6/10): \n\n&gt;The animation is still strong and the character beats are affecting, but the villain and his motivations stand in the film's way of true greatness.\n\n[The Wrap] (https://www.thewrap.com/moana-2-review-dwayne-johnson/):\n\n&gt;There\u2019s nothing particularly terrible about Moana 2, but the fact that it\u2019s necessary to write 'there\u2019s nothing particularly terrible about Moana 2' means something still went wrong.\n\n[The Guardian] (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/26/moana-2-review-vacuum-packed-disney-ocean-adventure-that-will-leave-you-cold) (2/5):\n\n&gt;It is all inoffensive enough, but weirdly lacking in anything genuinely passionate or heartfelt, all managed with frictionless smoothness and algorithmic efficiency.\n\n[The Times] (https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/moana-2-review-disneys-soulless-sequel-is-a-flabby-rehash-fms8l067g) (2/5) :\n\n&gt;The narrative stumbles forward in episodic fits and starts through self-contained story bites that have little impact on the wider, regrettably flabby, arc.\n\n**Synopsis**:\n&gt;\u201cMoana 2\u201d reunites Moana and Maui three years later for an expansive new voyage alongside a crew of unlikely seafarers. After receiving an unexpected call from her wayfinding ancestors, Moana must journey to the far seas of Oceania and into dangerous, long-lost waters for an adventure unlike anything she\u2019s ever faced.\n\n**Staring**:\n\n* Auli'i Cravalho as Moana\n* Dwayne Johnson as Maui\n* Alan Tudyk as Heihei\n* Temuera Morrison as Chief Tui\n* Nicole Scherzinger as Sina\n* Rose Matafeo as Loto\n* David Fane as Kele\n* Hual\u0101lai Chung as Moni\n* Khaleesi Lambert-Tsuda as Simea\n* Awhimai Fraser as Matangi\n* Gerald Ramsey as Tautai Vasa\n\nDirected by: David Derrick Jr., Jason Hand, Dana Ledoux Miller\n\nWritten by: Jared Bush and Dana Ledoux Miller\n\nProduced by: Christina Chen and Yvett Merino\n\nEdited by: Jake Roberts\n\nMusic by: Mark Mancina (score and songs), Opetaia Foa\u02bbi (score and songs), Abigail Barlow (songs), Emily Bear (songs)\n\nRunning time: 100 minutes",

He knows the original is long dead.\n\n(Before you get started, I'm *sure* people picked up on this but I did some googling after a recent viewing and I never saw anyone spell it out directly.)",

        "title": "Movie franchise titles that made sense for the first installment, but not for subsequent films",
        "content": "When a movie gets a sequel, the studio wants audiences to know that it's a sequel to a popular film, so they'll make sure to include the title or part of the title of the original film and add something to it, like \"Title 2\", \"Title II\", \"Title Part 2\", \"Title: The Revenge\", \"Tit2e\", etc.\n\nThis can sometimes be weird when the title of the original film was very specific to the events of the original film but doesn't really apply to the plot or characters of later installments. For example, Friday the 13th made sense as a title because the events took place on a Friday the 13th. However, many of the sequels explicitly do not take place on a Friday the 13th, especially the third and fourth movies which take place in the days right after the 2nd movie. Another example is how the Karate Kid title made sense for the original and its sequels, but didn't really make sense for the Jackie Chan remake because it was about Kung-Fu and not Karate.\n\nSometimes the studios are aware of this and will just change the title of the franchise to something more recognizable. The first Indiana Jones movie was called \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", a title that wouldn't work for sequels because the Ark of the Covenant had been dealt with. As such, it was decided to just rename the franchise after the main character Indiana Jones, and the first movie retroactively became \"Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark\". Same with First Blood retroactively becoming Rambo: First Blood once the franchise became Rambo.\n\nSo what other movie franchises have names that don't make sense in later installments, or had their names changed to something different from the title of the original installment?",

So I thought. \n\nI recently found out who my biological father is. It's very complicated and in the weeds, but we met a few times when I was a kid. He seemed really nice and I really liked him. I barely understood he was my real dad, but something deep within me felt safe and okay around him, like an intution. Due to my mother and a whole mess I never got to see him since I was 6. \n\nBut those few moments I had were hard to describe. It's hard to describe the emotion that come with a father you have a few moments with. A father you love and resonate with but remain obstructed and seperated from. The few moments where you feel peace and love that's paternal and true, and good. It was just a few moments that I never had the words for but Aftersun captured it perfectly.",
