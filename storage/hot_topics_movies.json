This implies that Lily is so controlling of Mia that she's dictated how Mia grieves *the death of her father*\n\n-When Mia gets the makeover and looks *stunning*, Lily is so overtly cruel and mocking that Mia, who until that moment was starting to feel herself for arguably the first time in her life, tries to make herself as small as possible.\n\n-When she finds out that Mia is in line for the throne of Genovia, her immediate and only thought is how it can benefit her, and when Mia turns her down because she can't just do shit as a head of state to appease her high school \"best friend\", she crashes out and abandons Mia.\n\nShe's one of the worst movie best friends out there for sure, but there are so many others.

        "title": "Black Hawk Down is the gift that keeps on giving.",
        "content": "Growing up in the '00's, I felt like I watched *Black Hawk Down* nearly on repeat. I always recall the significance of the roles played by Hartnett, Bana, Sizemore, Fichtner and the nearly (dark) comic relief provided by Bremner's performance (his role as Nelson being one of my favorites of the film to this day) but like a fine wine, it would take time for the careers of the many other actors to bring attention to their parts on subsequent watchings. \n\n  \nIt started with Orlando Bloom, of course, as well as Ewan McGregors. My mom being a fan of crime dramas would also highlight Enrique Muricano's role. Im sure I recognized Jeremy Piven and and Ioan Gruffud, but it wasnt until a conversation last night that inspired a re-watching today that really highlighted the absurdity of the cast. \n\nI always thought Orlando Bloom's role was comically short, but Gruffud's has him absolutely beat at a single scene and he was the far more established actor of the two (*BHD* is Bloom's second credit according to wikipedia while Gruffud had several, including *Titanic*). Piven spends most of the film deceased, while inversely Ewan McGregor plays a huge role that I somehow never noticed before (even though I recall numerous iconic scenes incolving his character, my brain somehow never managed to put two and two together). This makes sense as he was already at the height of his early success but mystifies me that young-me never even realized Obi Wan Kenobi was \"the coffee guy\" and that the coffee guy proceeded to continue on in the movie until the end.. \n\n  \nAll that brings me to the latest: \"Ty Burrell is in Black Hawk Down?\" I exclaimed when I heard. \"Where?\" Well, it takes nearly forever for him to show up, and I think he has a grand total of three scenes, but yes, the dad from Modern Family is indeed in the movie.\n\n  \nSecondly is Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, famous to many for his role as Jamie Lannister, he was lost in his character to me until now, portraying one of the two Delta Snipers who attempt to secure the Super Six Four until reinforcements can arrive. Did you know that? I do now!\n\n  \nLastly theres Tom Hardy in his film debut. Before Star Trek. Hidden in plain sight as he forms the straight man of the comedic duo of the film (as much as they can be called that) alongside Ewan Bremner's, Nelson. Yes the guy who deafened Bremner's character was Hardy. \n\n  \nBonus points for a blink-and-you'll-miss-it Corey Johnson. \n\n  \nAnyways, thats just the actors Ive since come to recognize. Im sure itll be different for others. If you havent watched Ridley Scott's adaptation of the Battle of Mogadishu in awhile (or ever!) I highly recommend putting it on. It still holds up reasonably well. ",

        "content": "Has anyone here recently rewatched American Beauty? I just watched it again and it has me thinking about how the film\u2019s portrayal of a broken, disconnected household in middle America feels even more relevant today. The tension, quiet resentment, and emotional distance shown in the movie seem to mirror what a lot of families are experiencing now. It\u2019s almost unsettling how accurately it captures the feeling of people living together but not truly connecting. I\u2019m curious whether others feel the same way about its depiction of modern American life. Does the movie still resonate with you in 2025 the way it did when it first came out?",

But it's still a great achievement, a masterclass of style.\n\nHis handling of comedy is unreal. It reminds me of the Coens (Lebowski, Raising Arizona), or of what the Farrelly's used to do in their earliest movies, in terms of shooting every scene, every line, as if it were the punchline to a long-ass joke.\n\nI would love to see him do a romantic comedy, or a road trip/adventure comedy movie.",

The website gives a rating on the CEFR scale (A1 - C2) of the linguistic difficulty of a movie.\n\nNow I would like to add a list of recommended films for those who are learning English and are not yet fluent. I can't just rely on my website because, of course, vocabulary is not the only measure of whether you can understand a film or not.\n\nCan you recommend some good films that have these characteristics?  \nFor example\n\n\n\nForrest Gump -&gt; OK\n\nTenet -&gt; absolutely not OK",

It's such a shame that the film is still reminiscent of modern day England - immigrant communities being made scapegoats by an angry, underserved white working class, when really it's the 1% they should be pointing their anger at. I feel like this film needs to be shown in classrooms across the UK if it isn't already.",
