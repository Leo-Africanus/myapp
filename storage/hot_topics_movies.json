A lot of reviews from people said that it was marketed as one thing and turned out to be something different. \n\nThe movie was marketed as a rom com. But it turned out to be mostly romance drama. People who know Celine Song from Past Lives would know that she is a deeper writer than what it was being marketed as. Someone said that the marketing made people who would not like the movie interested in it and people who would like it disinterested.\n\nHave there been any other cases where a movie could not reach its potential at the box office, just because of misguided marketing which affected the reviews?",

        "content": "Tom Hollander as Cutler Beckett is an undeniable highlight of both \"Pirate\" movies that he's in, both because of his relentlessly evil actions (the guy hangs a kid at the start of the third film and that just is one example of his vile behavior) and his non-stop air of smug self-satisfaction. So it is EXTREMELY satisfying at the climax to see him and his ship get blown to bits by the Black Pearl and the Flying Dutchman, especially because of his reaction to his demise. Does he panic or rage at his defeat? No, he completely shuts down in shock and disbelief, unable to believe that his plans have gone astray and he's doomed. All he can do is whisper \"It's just good business\" while practically going catatonic as his men abandon ship and leave him to his fate. And then you get the spectacular sight of him numbly walking down the steps as the ship is blown apart around him until a final explosion engulfs him. The movie itself is an overlong and unwieldy mess, but that sequence is worth the wait as it's a completely satisfying end for an arrogant A-hole who simply cannot handle defeat.",

        "title": "Larry Clark and Bully (2001)",
        "content": "Recently rewatched Bully (2001) and it still holds strong after 24 years. I've always enjoyed Larry Clark's honest and graphic writing. Scenes feel very uncomfortable and surreal. \n\nI'm not much younger than these kids (being a teen from around 03' and graduating 07') but they talk and act like the same exact people I went to high school with. Same with Larry Clark's \"Kids\" which is another great film.\n\nWe certainly didn't murder anyone like Marty and his friends did, but everything else I'm afraid was spot-on. The underage drinking, really really young kids smoking weed, sex, the slang, fashion, music, everything feels like a direct callback to myself and friends alike. Terrifying at hindsight if you ask me. \n\nIt *was* that bad, Larry Clark was just the only director with the balls to make these kinds of films. I heard someone say once that they thought the party scenes felt overdone and I just grinned to myself thinking \"Man you should have seen how bad we were in like 06'-07', we're lucky to even be alive.\" A lot of kids overdosed or ended up in prison like Marty.\n\nI get it. When you're young you're angry so your immediate thought in your undeveloped brain says you want to KILL this person. You think you mean it but you have no grasp on killing or what it's really like because you're just too young and stupid. I think Marty's friends fell into this trap and the girls just sort of tagged along for the ride thinking there would be no repercussions to being an accessory to murder \ud83d\ude02 \n\nA lot of directors try making realistic teenage films and they don't have the same firepower as Clark's films do. For years I've said LC is the only director who can get this genre right. \n\n",

On the one hand it seems like too little if you're not in high school but on the other hand it's interesting to watch a movie where the characters put up with so much for so little. Not a criticism exactly, just caught my eye. Also Go is finally streaming!",
