        "content": "I randomly decided to rewatch Children of Men the other night and I honestly wasn\u2019t prepared for how hard it would hit. I remembered it being good, but I had forgotten just how immersive and intense it is.\n\nFrom the very first scene the world feels completely lived in. The long takes, the grime, the handheld camera work. It doesn\u2019t feel like a movie, it feels like you\u2019re there. That car scene in the woods is still one of the most jaw-dropping sequences I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nWhat really surprised me is how relevant it still feels. The fear, the hopelessness, the way people cling to whatever\u2019s left. It\u2019s all eerily familiar now. And yet there\u2019s something deeply human at the heart of it. That moment with the crying baby floored me.\n\nIt\u2019s not a loud movie but it says everything it needs to. Just pure cinema.\n\nCurious if anyone else has revisited it recently. Did it hit you as hard as it did me?",

        "content": "I've seen a fair few posts about movies people think have a reputation for being better or worse than their reputation would suggest, so I thought it would be interesting to discuss reputations about aspects of the movie beyond its quality. \n\nSome examples of what I'm talking about based on my own opinions:\n\n1. Inception: This movie has a reputation for being confusing or hard to follow, but tbh I don't think it's either of those. The movie does a lot to explain the rules of the world and the mechanics of dreams, and each dream level has a distinct enough setting that it's clear which level a scene is taking place in. The only thing about the movie that I think could be considered confusing is the ending, but to me that's not so much confusing as it is deliberately open-ended.\n\n2. Sinister: This one is interesting because it's not really a reputation that cropped up naturally, but rather it came from a study on horror movies, but the movie is sort of branded as the scariest horror movie ever made, and I don't think that's the case. I really like Sinister, I think it's a good horror movie with some tense moments, but it's never one that's jumped out at me as especially scary in the grand scheme of the genre.",

The snowy landscapes, the way every shot is framed, it all feels very cinematic. The action is insanely violent but so over the top that it becomes kind of fun. There are scenes that had me laughing out loud just from how absurdly badass they were.\n\nThe main character barely speaks but says everything with his presence. It\u2019s simple, efficient storytelling that works. If you go in expecting gritty realism you might be thrown off because it leans heavily into fantasy action territory but if you let go and enjoy the ride it\u2019s incredibly satisfying.\n\nWould love to hear what others thought. Especially curious how people felt about the ending.",

        "content": "I\u2019m watching Lawrence of Arabia on blu ray right now and I\u2019m blown away with how fantastic it looks. I notice the same things when watching most older movies, such as 2001 which I have on 4k and various other titles like north by northwest. \n\nI know some of the reasons why, here is what I know. \n\nFilms that were actually shot and enhanced on film have a more natural and close to real life look. Movies now, even when shot on film, are enhanced digitally and tend to look more artificial as a result. When I say \u201cbetter\u201d I mean it looks more life like, more clear (if that makes sense), the colors pop way more, etc. Digital movies lose that because of color filters and digital enhancements. \n\nIs that the only reason? Do lenses used play a part? Something with technicolor? I\u2019m just blown away every time I pop in a 4k or blu ray even of old ass movies and they just look incredible.  ",

Maybe it\u2019s just the fact that he was unrecognizable in JW4, but I was really impressed by him in it. Killa was a super fun antagonist with a good amount of personality (loved the way he kept having to use his inhaler) and it was hilarious and surprising to see him actually throw hands",

I was talking about Robocop with my wife last night (as I often do, she puts up with a lot) and realised that although the film is one of my all time favourites, Robocop the character is probably the thing I like the least about the picture, Weller is fine as the resurrected man, but the supporting characters, the villains and the world building are all so much more enjoyable than a do-good monosyllabic shiny robot man.\n\nI know that sometimes protagonists are there to act as a vessel for the audience- carrying the story along, but not being particularly interesting themselves.\n\nWhat are some examples of films you absolutely love, but the protagonist would be at the bottom of the list of reasons you love them-?
