When she realized that it was part of the godawful live-action Spider-Verse with no relation to the MCU or even Tom Holland's Spider-Man, it was too late. So she pretty much slept through the whole movie, speaking in a monotone voice that actually made her performance unintentionally hilarious and added into its status as a modern campy cult film. \n\nRooney Mara hated doing the Nightmare on Elm Street remake so much that she bragged about giving a bad performance on purpose. She still hates that movie with the force of a thousand suns. \n\nWhoopi Goldberg tried to get away from making \"Theodore Rex\", so much so she ended up getting sued for not doing her job, so she asked for a hefty paycheck, and did the movie in a black leather cat suit and a permanent grouch in her face. \n\nElizabeth Taylor didn't want to do Butterfield 8. She was grieving Mike Todd and ended up being forced to do it because she was under contract. She had to say lines like \"I'm the Slut of All time\" in the movie and it got released during the Eddie Fisher scandal which made it worse. Even winning the Oscar didn't change Taylor's mind, she thought she only won because she nearly died of pneumonia and threw the Oscar into the trash.",

        "content": "Been producing indies for a while and got sick of the guesswork around who's actually buying, what people are looking for, and general trends coming out of film markets. Spent months tracking acquisition patterns and eventually just decided to start building myself a tool to help resolve this pain point! Some things I've been finding from the data that's being tracked.\n\n**Budget reality that'll surprise you:**\n\n* Horror has 105 buyers in the $5-25M range (way more than expected)\n* Only 51 buyers want horror under $5M (the \"cheap horror\" myth is dead)\n* 20 companies are seeking horror at $25M+ (elevated horror is real)\n\n**Weirdly specific buyer needs happening right now:**\n\n* Netflix specifically wants \"period dramas with strong female protagonists\" and \"Australian content\"\n* Hulu is actively seeking \"coming-of-age comedies with LGBTQ+ themes\" under $5M\n* Monkeypaw Productions wants \"contained horror/thriller with societal commentary under $25M\"\n* Sony is hunting for \"contained supernatural horror with youth ensemble cast\"\n\n**The data shows something counterintuitive:**\n\n* 1,329 companies have very specific, detailed acquisition needs (not just \"seeking drama\")\n* The buyers with the most specific requirements are often the most accessible\n* Generic pitches are getting lost - precision targeting is what's working\n\n**What seems to have worked for me:**\u00a0Skip the generic pitches. The data shows buyers know exactly what they want right now. Match those exact needs and you'll cut through the noise. Obviously easier said than done! Hardest part is obviously getting that foot in the door. But I just found putting all my effort and time into specific buyers versus spray and pray has paid off more. \n\nGot so frustrated with this guesswork that I went hard down the rabbit hole of vibe coding and built myself a solution that tracks a massive amount of data then analyzes it and matches buyers with my projects. Probably overkill, but manually following thousands of companies was driving me insane. I also couldn't find other solutions to help with this.\n\nAnyone other filmmakers finding success with hyper-targeted pitches? What pathways and most successful strategies worked for you?",

But the opera scene with Cher in that black dress and all-black make-up was mesmerizing, I think that sequence won her the Oscar. \n\nOlympia Dukakis was the heart and soul of the movie for me. There was more emotion, it was more grounded for me. Her character having to suffer in silence as her husband cheats on her and her dalliance with John Mahoney's character. That arc had way more substance than the muppet show delivered by Cher and Nicolas Cage cosplaying Stanley Kowalski meets Frank Zappa.",

Yeah, I get it the Martha scene is ridiculous, the pacing is all over the place, critics trashed it\u2026 but I honestly think it has some of the best visuals and comic-book-style moments in any superhero movie. The warehouse fight? The Batman intro? The soundtrack? Absolute cinema.\n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s flawless, but sometimes you just want a movie that feels epic, even if it\u2019s messy.",

        "title": "Favorite movie by Asian country: Hong Kong",
        "content": "# PLEASE READ.\n\nOkay this will be a longer post because I want to clarify some things after yesterday's China which went really well and I think Hong Kong will get just as much participation. I know people don't like reading these days, but bear with me specifically for today and the rest of the days shouldn't be nearly as long.\n\nFirst and foremost, I am seeking to find the [best movie from each country around the globe](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lth326/favorite_movies_from_each_country_asia_afghanistan/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button), starting in Asia. We were just on the seventh day with [China](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1m0axei/favorite_movie_by_asian_country_china/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button). Today is Hong Kong.\n\nBefore you go and comment \"well what about Cyprus and Georgia.\" Geographically they might be in Asia a bit, but I am skipping because they've already been done by the person I was inspired by to do this in the first place- u/Impossible_Werewolf8. They did Europe already and those countries are more often seen as European. If you want to check out those winners, here is [Cyprus](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1giqa5j/favorite_movie_by_european_country_cyprus/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) and [Georgia](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gnchru/favorite_movie_by_european_country_georgia/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button).\n\nFrom all of the participation with China a few pointed out that the listed winner for Brunei was in fact entirely set in Bhutan. Now if you go to the original post for Brunei, the only recommendation that counts is this wrong movie because there just simply wasn't participation and there's less than 50 movies in total from Brunei. Thankfully, I have been crossposting into r/Letterboxd and the country's sub to get more traction and participation. [Brunei](https://www.reddit.com/r/Letterboxd/comments/1lyj39x/favorite_movie_by_asian_country_brunei/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)'s letterboxd crosspost had one comment mentioning a movie called **Yasmine (2014) directed by Siti Kamaluddin**. This is a martial arts movie about a Bruneian high school girl. While I typically won't be looking at the comments under these crossposts or counting them, this will be the exception since there's no other option. I should've double checked in the first place but will definitely going forward.\n\nMoving on to our 7th day winner from China. I initially was going to include Hong Kong in with mainland China, but within ten minutes of posting realized that was dumb and put a quick edit note that quite a few didn't see so they asked about it (read before commenting people!) I had already planned to do Taiwan separate and have even decided that Tibet should be separated too. I will not do a single other region from China separately. These are the regions where a lot of the citizens don't even identify as Chinese citizens and have had calls to be their own countries. It's like going from Wisconsin to Puerto Rico- American but not really. Well Hong Kong just happens to be alphabetically next so it's more of a continuation of yesterday.\n\nWith all that being said, our mainland China winner is **Hero (2002) directed by Zhang Yimou.** I hadn't heard of this movie surprisingly so I was happy to see that this won over something more ubiquitous to a white guy from Wisconsin such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. There were many other great recommendations that you should still add to your watchlist.\n\nThe rules that you really should read before commenting:\n\nI) It's not important if the movie was made in the given country, but it *has* to be set there (e.g. the movie can be set in Paris, but hasn't to be a french movie after all). Big Trouble in Little China was nominated under China....but that's..... set in San Francisco. So please make sure it is SET in the listed country. Mainstream American made movies are totally okay. A good example from China being Mulan. Yes that is English language and yes that is a Disney western movie. Movies like this are still helpful to add to the conversation because they bring light to other cultures to Americans that otherwise would not get interested in those other cultures. HOWEVER, let's always try to prioritize movies with the native language, if possible. Also, if a movie is split between a few locations I\u2019m looking for where it\u2019s rooted.\n\nII) Animated movies are okay but not documentaries.\n\nIII) On ties I'll just pick the movie with less reviews on imdb to spotlight the lesser known films.\n\nIV) Nominate only one movie. I won't count any votes towards comments that mention 2 or more.\n\nV) After 24 hours, whatever movie comment gets the most upvotes, wins. **Make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment.** I can do math and add the votes from separate comments but that's annoying.\n\nThat was really long and I appreciate those that actually read this one in full. Thank you!\n\nDay 7: China (mainland)- Hero (2002) directed by Zhang Yimou\n\nDay 6: Cambodia- The Killing Fields (1984) directed by Roland Joffe\n\nDay 5: Brunei- Yasmine (2014) directed by Siti Kamaluddin\n\nDay 4: Bhutan - Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom (2019) directed by Pawo Choyning Dorji\n\nDay 3: Bangladesh- The Clay Bird (2002) directed by Tareque Masud\n\nDay 2: Bahrain- Hamad and the Pirates (1971) directed by Richard Lyford\n\nDay 1: Afghanistan- Osama (2004) directed by Siddiq Barmak\n\nDue to request here is a [letterboxd list](https://boxd.it/L1lwe) featuring each winner.",
