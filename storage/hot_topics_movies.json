        "title": "I rewatched Am\u00e9lie after 20 years. It\u2019s still one of my very favorite films, which surprised me when I realized how \u201ctell don\u2019t show\u201d it is.",
        "content": "Am\u00e9lie has got to be one of the most accessible foreign films out there to an English speaking audience. I was around 13 when it released, and my experience watching it wasn\u2019t all that different seeing it again at 37. People even show it to young children and they get it, too (despite puritanical ratings boards getting their knickers in a twist about the comedic and rather brief sex scenes).\n\nWhat really leapt out at me this time was something that I guess can only come with 20+ years of film literacy since my first watch: that the film takes *every* opportunity it can to be as crystal clear as possible about what is going on, to the point that it becomes \u201ctell not show\u201d at a baseline level. Or at least, \u201ctell AND show.\u201d\n\nJean-Pierre Jeunet has his actors speak from the heart (while they emote so bombastically and delightfully you could understand their mental state from watching this on a vaseline-smeared TV set), and any time Am\u00e9lie has a big moment of change, a narrator is there to guide us through an exact breakdown of her thoughts and beliefs. Many important characters get an entire origin story told to us and a quick bullet point list read off about how they think. There are amazing visuals and stagings and editing and all of it is very clever language of its own, but it is all so on the nose and makes for what\u2019s probably the least challenging \u201cgreat movie\u201d I\u2019ve ever seen. And I love that it succeeds so thoroughly in spite of that\u2026 or perhaps, more interestingly, because of it.\n\nPart of me has been almost conditioned by challenging cinema and video essays that demand a viewer pay close attention and do a lot of mental work to fully enjoy cinema, and there sometimes seems to be this belief going around in film circles that anything that doesn\u2019t require deep thought is somehow a lesser form of art\u2026 but here is Am\u00e9lie, cheerfully and lovingly doing the opposite, bringing viewers to happy tears whether they\u2019re analyzing it or not. And I love it for it. Especially now. I needed that escape yesterday.\n\nAnd I want to remind others that yes, there is a ticket to happiness that you can have too, and it exists in the form of a doe-eyed lead on a quirky green DVD box (or I guess, stream it too) and it doesn\u2019t require you to be at your most tip-top shape as a viewer to just deeply connect to it on a soul level.\n\nMagnifique.",

        "content": "Just had a conversation with my wife, and we asked ourselves what was the last movie that made us go, \u201cwow, that was really good\u201d?\n\nFor context, we\u2019re millennials who grew up on 90s, 2000s, and 2010s/2020s films. We were just watching the Hans Zimmer concert DVD, and when they played themes from Batman, Inception, Interstellar, and some of his other classics, those brought back some great memories. But in the last five years, we honestly can\u2019t think of many films that gave us that same \u201cwow\u201d factor.\n\nThe only recent one that really stood out was Top gun 2. Outside of that, nothing else really comes to mind.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Have movies actually declined in quality, or are we just getting older and harder to impress?",

More dumb jokes. \n\nIMO they really did an amazing job bringing back the vibe of the originals. So freaking refreshing. \n\nLeslie Nielsen fucking crushed that role. \n\nLiam Neeson also crushed it.

He was physically touching it and knows that sea monster came from the exact body of water he's floating in. He could not possibly have more reason to fear sea monsters, but instead of getting back on the boat ASAP his first instinct is to splash around while making jokes and \\*SURPRISE\\* he gets eaten by a sea monster. Nice guy, never did anything to anyone, absolutely had it coming. Any other good guy characters get got in a way that they kind of had coming?",

I can tell you almost everything that happens in this movie but I have next to no idea what's going on. When it's not boring it's confusing. A lot of stuff happens in this movie but it all feels weirdly disconnected, even though I understand it's not.\n\n* The Fountain - Saw it once, could not recall even half of it an hour after the credits rolled, I have no idea what it even was.

        "title": "Weapons (2025) observation [Spoilers]",
        "content": "&gt;!In Weapons, Josh Brolin\u2019s character seems to have much more depth than what is initially revealed. From the very start, he stands apart from the others, most notably when he\u2019s the only one in the meeting who dares to stand up and shout at the teacher. Throughout the film, his grief over his missing son is shown to run deeper than anyone else\u2019s. In his dreams, we see him vulnerable, crying, and longing to tell his son once more how much he loved him. These moments suggest that his actions and emotions are driven by a pure force of love and light.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!This stands in stark contrast to the witch, who embodies darkness, evil, and a complete lack of empathy. Even his impulsive act of painting on the teacher\u2019s car feels symbolic. Though he mistakenly directs his suspicion at the teacher, who isn\u2019t a witch, something inside him seems to sense the nearby presence of evil. It\u2019s as if the director is hinting at a larger struggle between good and evil woven into the film.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!His dreams reveal even more. When he envisions the floating rifle above the house, it suggests a psychic awareness: that the children, and the people under the witch\u2019s control, are being used as weapons. At one point in his dream, he nearly connects with his son, implying that his son may also possess some kind of psychic power. But just as that bond strengthens, the witch intrudes and blocks him. Significantly, he had never seen her before, which further supports the idea that he has genuine psychic perception.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Unlike the other characters, Brolin\u2019s character seems attuned to this hidden battle. Even in his dreams, he resists the witch\u2019s influence until he confronts her directly, where she finally manages to trap him, because she knows the \u201crules of the game,\u201d while he does not. This sets him apart: he alone has the visions, the dreams, and the revelations. In the film\u2019s moral framework, he embodies good, while the witch embodies pure evil.!&lt;",

At first I thought it was going to be a boring movie that I would watch just for the sake of watching a movie of his choice with him. But fortunately, Frailty is one of those \"few exceptions\". This movie is SO GOOD. I'm surprised it isn't more popular. The story was gripping, the pacing was certainly slow but never enough to be boring, the performances are great (RIP Bill Paxton), and the final twist was good too. I was completely in awe while watching it, I totally expected it to get worse at some point but it's actually really consistent in my opinion. I rate it as a 9/10, definitely one of the best movies of 2001 for me\n\nWhat do you think? Do you like the movie?",
