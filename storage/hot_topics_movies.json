        "content": "what a film, i loved begbies character he unintentionally was the funniest character of the bunch, its a really deep and vague film about a loads of different stuff, mainly including the theme of heroin addiction which is depicted perfectly in this film almost more perfect than requiem of a dream. the scene of renton in his bedroom after being locked by his parents was truly astonishing, evan mcgregor plays this scene wonderfully showing true acts of agony as a man faces his one and only fear, his addiction. the vivid hallucinations put you in a huge state of uncomfortableness accompanied by the soundtrack which adds more pressure onto the scene, the narrations and visuals make it even better than it already is and the soundtrack is fucking fantastic. the comedy bits leave you dying like the part when begbie tries to find the clit but finds out hes making out with a guy, left me fucking dying on my chair. and the ending had to be the most satisfactory for me. a guy who went from being just a druggie addicted to heroin to him going clean, finally being content with life and now leaving his badly influenced friends who just led him to the wrong paths in life. very satisfactory. loved it.",

Yet the protagonist in this film is a bad guy and basically achieves full victory. \n\nWhat's interesting is that this film is a very loose adaptation of the Crime and Punishment novel, but in C&amp;P the protagonist doesn't get away with it the way he does in MP. MP almost seems like the nihilist revision of C&amp;P. ",
