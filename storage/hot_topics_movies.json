But my mental well-being has also changed dramatically.\n\nScrolling videos made my brain feel like porridge. I'd suddenly realize after 5 seconds that I was watching an obnoxious ad. No focus at all. Totally spaced out.\n\nWatching a movie actually makes me feel good. Being engaged in a storyline, maybe watching a feelgood movie like I did yesterday (The Intern) \u2026 It makes me happy and relaxed. It makes me enjoy life *more* afterwards.\n\nReading and working out is great as well, but it never made me not want to scroll. Watching a movie fulfills my desire for easy entertainment, without making it impossible to do something productive after.\n\nTomorrow marks a month of watching a movie every single day. Well, sometimes I watch half one day and the other half the next. I still think it counts.\n\nEdit: [Yes, I know I'm on reddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1qxdevy/comment/o3w4oe1/?context=3)",

        "title": "B-Tier Directors Who Had A Great Run",
        "content": "Who is a B-tier level director you feel had a great run of films? Not your Nolans or Spielbergs or Tarantinos, but someone who specialized in less respectable fare. \n\nI always think of Renny Harlin\u2019s run from 1988 - 1999. I absolutely love Elm Street 4, Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger, The Long Kiss Goodnight, and Deep Blue Sea, and I\u2019m one of the few people who will defend Cutthroat Island (and saw it in theaters!). Things went downhill after that, but I also enjoy The Covenant as some tasty homoerotic cheese. \n\nWho is one of your B-tier faves?",

        "title": "Saturday Night Fever: Unexpectedly Insightful",
        "content": "Just watched Saturday Night Fever because I was curious about John Travolta\u2019s role, but I knew nothing about the film other than disco before watching.\n\n  \nI was immediately pulled into Tony\u2019s glamorized nightlife and his status as the king of his local club. The music and dance sequences are electric, but what surprised me most was how much emotional weight sits underneath all that spectacle. Frank\u2019s character, even with the limited screen time he gets, really stuck with me. His quiet frustration and moral unease subtly push Tony toward seeing his life differently. I also loved the religious symbolism throughout, which adds to the sense of guilt, longing, and wanting something more.\n\nWhat really stood out to me, though, was how much the film trusts its audience. This film isn\u2019t endorsing the racism or misogyny it shows, it\u2019s portraying them as normalized parts of Tony\u2019s world that slowly leave him feeling empty. The injustice of the dance competition and the rape scene aren\u2019t there just for shock; they\u2019re meant to break Tony\u2019s illusions about success, masculinity, and belonging. Compared to a lot of modern movies, which often feel the need to spell out their morals, this approach feels refreshing. The film assumes you can think critically and sit with discomfort, and that makes it feel more honest and real.\n\nIt\u2019s been an interesting window into that time period. Definitely in my top 15 so far.",

Regulars can recite the pre-recorded spiel that plays before a by heart: no talking, no texting, and keep your devices dark, silent, and\u00a0out of sight. That last point currently has customers up in arms.\n\nCurrently, any Alamo Drafthouse social media post\u2014no matter the subject\u2014is accompanied by an onslaught of comments about the theater's plan to kill its classic paper-and-pen ordering model and replace it with a QR code-based platform, effectively ending its longstanding \u201cno phones\u201d policy. The shift is seen as a betrayal of Alamo Drafthouse\u2019s promise of a viewing experience with limited distractions. People have called it a bellwether of staffing reductions. And what better way to justify the development cost of a new ordering platform than by cutting expenses?\n\nAlamo Drafthouse\u2019s current predicament notwithstanding, there is no reason a theater cannot implement mobile ordering technology without sacrificing its soul. In fact, another Texas-based chain has done exactly that over the past several years. ",
