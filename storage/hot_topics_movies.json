It felt empty, incoherent, jumping from event to event without being embedded in a proper story arc that connected everything. It was a huge disappointment for me. Now I just noticed that a Director's Cut exists, which leaves me twisted: I'm kinda interested to see whether that cut makes up for the weaknesses of the original... But then again I wouldn't wanna waste yet another 3,5 hours. Has anyone been able to compare the two versions yet? ",

And after seeing this movie 6 times, try as I might, I cannot figure out how the *Last* part of the title references the plot of the actual movie. So it feels like the ending and the title itself all tell the audience that this is Indiana Jones' happy ending. \n\nWith such a symbolically conclusive ending, a philosophical line has to be drawn. Barring a truly amazing legacy sequel ala Top Gun: Maverick, should they have left well enough alone at The Last Crusade?",

        "content": "I can't count the number of times when I go into a movie expecting one thing and ending up getting something very different. The trailer can be deceiving, so can be comments from fans and critical reviewers. \n\nBut there been situations I've been pleasantly surprised, where I initially read the premise and thought  I'll skip it because the premise sounded bad (boring, stupid, extreme, absurd) but ended up seeing it years later on TV and I was like Wow, can't believe that premise worked!\n\nCase in point the movie Lobster. I won't say it's my favorite but it was definitely worth watching. And the premise is so weird. It's about a bunch of people forced to pick a romantic partner in a short time because the alternative is they will turn into animals. Of course you can laugh at it but it's played serious, which creates a situation that is absurd and yet you can't look away from it. \n\nIt's almost like you decide to pretend you're a cloud or something, but then you do it so well that people being to wonder what it would mean IF you were a cloud. It's almost the opposite of the situation where someone takes a serious theme, like child abuse, and does such a bad job (bad script, editing, casting choices) that it doesn't connect with people at all. \n\nThat's why I like movies with a seemingly bad or weak premise that turns out well. I think that's art, to be able to make me see something or think about it or care about it, when I would not have otherwise.",

Set against the backdrop of the Mexican Revolution, the movie revolves around 5 men, hired to rob a train carrying 500,000$ worth gold, by the rebels.\n\nThe leader of the group is simply known as Dutchman, who hires the other members, played by Peter Graves more known for his role in Mission Impossible TV series.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2wvrxq931zae1.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c54a32162f0f2a886e6cac1e6c38fe419a7d486\n\nBud Spencer is Mesito aka The Animal, a strong man, known for his brute strength, the kind of role he usually revels in.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/75j6dz9i1zae1.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dabea378306d982f173f7e8d213095402717a102\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w86zqapn1zae1.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d39cc8f6c4ec762a5fddd9ac46935d34706d32fb\n\nItalian actor Nino Castelnuovo is Luis Dominguez, a former circus acrobat turned outlaw, known for his lethal sling shot.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c72zf6y62zae1.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1a700f7b2ac9978e2183fe78485b3605f7d9a8e\n\nJames Daly known for his role in the TV series Medical Center is Capt Augustus Bennet, aka the Gambler,  who had served earlier in the same unit as The Dutchman, and is an explosives expert.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s38l06sc4zae1.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea7add83e33cf4d00812f34ffa52f16bb3032f29\n\nJapanese actor Tetsuro Tamba is Samurai, who earns a living in sideshows with his samurai skills.\n\nThe movie is basically on the lines of 5 guys getting together on a crazy mission, which is trying to pull off a gold heist on a heavily guarded train.  Needless to say the entire train robbery sequence is brilliantly shot, you feel the edge of seat excitement, as the 5 men, attempt to pull it off, stumbling at places, but do manage it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m3mvo9iq4zae1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46800889caf3c302d78a0a2552da26f39550462a\n\nThe train sequence apart, there are a lot of good action scenes too, especially the cat and mouse game between the Mexican military and the 5 guys, the near misses.\n\nThe movie has some pretty poignant scenes too, one being where the residents of a village, migrate en masse, to escape the wrath of the military for sheltering the 5 guys.  As also some scenes showing the atrocities inflicted by the military on the prisoners and peasants.\n\nThe sequences and bonding between the 5 guys, is well depicted too, as you keep rooting for them to pull off the mission.\n\nEnnio Morricone's music is perfect for the movie, especially the opening credits with montages of the Mexican revolution shown.\n\nThis is the kind of fun movie, perfect for the weekend, to relax with, as you get drawn into a crazy ride of adventure and action.",

        "title": "What happened to the Daniel Craig era James Bond series?",
        "content": "The general sentiment around the Craig era is that Casino Royale and Skyfall are masterpieces and the other films are either just \"okay\" or downright stupid/boring, definitely not must-rewatch material like the first and third.\n\nI couldn't help but notice that after Skyfall there seemed to be a misguided tonal shift. The first three movies definitely were trying to go for a more grounded-in-reality approach with real life stakes that felt relatable to our modern world (Terrorists/African warlords/Foreign coups). They definitely wanted to ditch the mustache-twirling evil-lair campiness of the earlier bond films in favor of making them as realistic as possible. They even hang a lampshade on this in Skyfall when Q says \"A gun and a radio. What were you expecting an exploding pen? We don't really go for that anymore.\"\n\nHowever in the last two films, they seem to ditch this attempt at over-realism and lean back into the campiness of the old era with notable silly/campy plot points such as the sinister shadowy men sitting around a giant golden table, or a killer nano-robot virus that targets DNA, or machines that can wipe your memories/mind-control you. The gadgets themselves also seem to have taken a 180. Despite them poking fun at the campiness of the older bond films with their high tech gadgets, they end up going back on it and added silly gadgets like the magical magnet balls that allow you float like in zero-gravity.\n\nKeep in mind there is nothing wrong with this approach if you wanted the whole franchise to be like this but the over-the-top campiness of the last two (and arguably bits of the third) definitely clash with the tone that was initially established in the first movie.\n\nThe later bond movies also seem to have an obsession with bond as a character with a sort of \"he's key to all of this\" approach whereas in the first couple movies Bond was just a normal expendable but highly-competent agent. They also pull the \"everything is connected\" card, and claim all the villains from the first movies were all secretly working together instead of just letting them stand on their own and have their own motivations.\n\nFor me personally, I got so attached to the way the first movie was presented that I just couldn't get on board with the last couple. I don't know how we went from targeting financial operations of terrorists to trying to stop killer micro robot infection missiles, and the jarring shift in tone is just too much for me to overlook as someone who prefers the more grounded movies.\n\nI still watch Casino Royale and Skyfall to this day, but I never had any desire to rewatch any of the others. Am I alone in this?",

In fact, it sold so poorly that they didn\u2019t even make a sequel. I guess my question is why? And is the transcendent, blockbuster comedy movie dead?",

        "title": "Top 5 Best Sci-Fi-Fi/Fantasy Movies of 2024",
        "content": "The year of 2024 has finally ended, And there has been many stinkers that has been shoved down our throats this year, but I wanted to start the year with a more positive note. Even though there were many disappointments, there are also some directors out there that still appreciate cinema over money. I\u2019ve put together a list of my top 5 best sci-fi/fantasy movies that have come out in 2024 and perhaps you might agree. Let me know in the comments what you would change about my list and why. \n\n#5 Deadpool &amp; Wolverine\n\nComing in at number 5 for me is Deadpool &amp; Wolverine. This was perhaps the most anticipated movie, people were talking about Deadpool &amp; Wolverine for months before it finally released. That happened for a couple reasons, one is because\u2026 well\u2026 it\u2019s Deadpool &amp; Wolverine in the same movie. Who wouldn\u2019t want to see two of the greatest comic book adaptations to fight each other. The most important reason is because they had some of the best marketing I\u2019ve ever seen for a movie. However, given all the hype surrounding this movie, it might have given me high expectations that the film just couldn\u2019t reach. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a good laugh and great action, Deadpool &amp; Wolverine is perfect for you, but I didn\u2019t think that Deadpool\u2019s motivations were as powerful as his motivations in the 2nd Deadpool movie. In Deadpool 2, he is motivated by the loss of his girlfriend, in Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, he\u2019s mainly motivated by his loss of usefulness. The plot concerning Cassandra Nova didn\u2019t feel very satisfying. Cassandra Nova is a powerful being, and it kind of sucks that she died so easily. With that being said, it\u2019s still a hilarious and action packed movie. \n\n#4 Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes\n\nNumber 4 would be Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes for me. What I love most about this movie is the absolutely stunning visuals it gives you, as well as how they portrayed the humans versus the apes. The humans that are waltzing about in the wild can no longer speak, and are being herded and manipulated like sheep. One thing this movie succeeds at is that you actually feel like this is what the world would look like if apes really did rule the earth, it feels more realistic in the sense that I can see this being the case in an alternate timeline. Some of the other apes movies didn\u2019t really achieve that. \n\nI put this movie at number 4 because it\u2019s set years after Caesar died with new characters and a new world entirely. There are many people including myself that wish this movie could\u2019ve been about Caesars son and the struggles he went through when he took his fathers place. I also didn\u2019t feel very invested in the main characters at all, and nothing Noa or Mae did was very compelling. The only character I actually felt something for died half-way through the film, and only got like 20 minutes of screen time. \n\n#3 Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga\n\nRight in the middle of the stack, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga comes in at number 3. You know, I\u2019ve never seen Mad Max, but even without knowing the full extent of the story, I was still very immersed in her story and how she was able to finally get her revenge, it\u2019s quite refreshing. What this movie does very well at is giving us characters that are very inventive and psychotic in their own way. The relationship between Dementus and Furiosa Is a very interesting component, and adds a very compelling character development throughout the film where Dementus becomes his own downfall by giving Furiosa the tools and the motivation she needs to defeat him. \n\nThere are also components that I felt needed to be worked on a bit more, or felt a little unnecessary. There were some explosions and battle scenes that have painfully obvious CGI and looks like it was stitched together for a school project that you procrastinated till the last second so you have to just send it in half finished. They didn\u2019t use as many practical effects as the original film did, maybe that was to save time, but it\u2019s just not gonna age as well as practical effects would. The last complaint I have of Furiosa is that there are too many endings. There was like 4 separate times where I thought the credits were gonna roll only for there to be another 20 minutes left in the movie.\n\n#2 Alien: Romulus\n\nIn second place I have Alien: Romulus, and I was tossing and turning on whether to put this at #1 or not because I really enjoyed this movie. One of the best things about this movie is that everything that happens causes another problem to occur, and most movies do have a cause and effect to them, but this one really sticks out to me because it\u2019s the little things that matter. Things that might feel very mundane to the audience actually make a very big impact later on. I am also a big fan of the Alien franchise, and I really appreciate that they brought this film back to the same style of the first Alien movie. They even went back to using practical effects for the Xenomorphs which was a sight for sore eyes to say the least. \n\nOne of the main reasons why I didn\u2019t give this one the top spot is because not everyone is gonna love this movie. I watched this movie a second time in theatres with my dad and my brother, and they didn\u2019t like it that much. it might be disturbing for some people as well because of that absolute abomination at the end. Another complaint is that it can sometimes be too predictable. That\u2019s pretty common with movies in this genre, but people are starting to get sick of the same old cliches in every movie. \n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nBefore we take a dive into the number 1 sci-fi/fantasy movie this year, let\u2019s take a look at a couple honourable mentions that didn\u2019t quite make my top 5. \n\nSmile 2\n\nFirst there is Smile 2. I really enjoyed this movie, and it took me about a week to fully recover from it because it is absolutely terrifying. The idea of having a pop star as the main character is genius because she is constantly being watched, she\u2019s constantly surrounded by people so you never know when the smile entity is going infect someone else. The reason I didn\u2019t put it in my top 5 is because this movie is way too similar to the first one. I was expecting this film to explore more about what the entity actually is then going through the same process that we saw before. \n\nWicked\n\nNow, we can\u2019t go talking about the best of 2024 without talking about Wicked. I was surprised by how good Wicked was, and how accurate it was to the play as well. Most of the songs are pretty powerful and the movie as a whole gives off a very cheerful attitude. The main reason why I didn\u2019t put this one in my top 5 is because I\u2019m not a woman. I\u2019m not saying that men can\u2019t like this movie, but all the themes, undertones, and characters are meant for a female audience, and there is just a lot of other movies I\u2019d rather watch than this one. This is the type of movie I\u2019d only watch if it\u2019s my wife\u2019s turn to pick the movie. \n\nNosferatu\n\nMy last honorable mention before we move on to the number 1 sci-fi/fantasy film of the year is Nosferatu. I just recently came back from watching this one, and man\u2026 it is disturbing to say the least. I believe this to be a really good film, but it is also an acquired taste. This is the type of movie you would watch just for the pure love of cinema. The way that each shot smoothly transitions into another really sucks your eyeballs to the screen. The acting was some of the best I\u2019ve ever seen, the actors had to do some pretty demanding things in this movie and they didn\u2019t hold back. My favourite component is the poetic nature of the dialogue, I was just intently pondering every single word spoken because it really was like listening to poetry. The reason this one isn\u2019t in my top 5 is because to be honest, it\u2019s a little too artsy for me to really get into the story. With films like this, the pacing always seems a bit choppy in some parts because they\u2019re relying too much on the visuals to tell the story. I also thought the ending was a little unsatisfying as well.\n\n#1 Dune: Part Two\n\nIf you made it this far into the video I just wanted to say I appreciate you, and just go ahead and hit that subscribe button if you haven\u2019t already done that. Now, we finally made it the number 1 sci-fi/fantasy movie of the year and this probably isn\u2019t a surprise to anyone, but it is Dune: Part two. This film is pretty artsy too, but does it in a way that makes the narrative a lot more clear. Each character knows what their roles are, and the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking. Denis Villeneuve always has the most beautiful scenes in his movies, and he is one of my favourite directors for that. This movie also explains all of the questions you might have had after the first one. Dune part one was just setting up the world with is what made it a little slow, and at times kind of boring, but Dune part two is where everything comes together, and where I was able to get fully immersed into this universe. \n\nOne complaint that a lot of people had who read the books really didn\u2019t like the change that was made to chani\u2019s character. In the books, Chani fully believes in Pauls visions, and is completely loyal to him. In the movie, she is skeptical of everything, and doesn\u2019t believe him to be the Lisan al gaib like everyone else.\n\nConclusion\n\nWell, these are my top 5 sci-fi/fantasy movies of 2024.
