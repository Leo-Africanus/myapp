        "content": "Screenwriters of course have to convey information to the audience in one form or another, and the canonical maxim is \"show, don't tell.\"  Not every writer adheres to that rule, though, and we're all familiar with some of the lazy tricks writers use to dump info on the audience (expository newscasts, for example).\n\nFor a good example of exposition in screenwriting, I'd offer up *Apollo 13*.  The exposition and background info is given in relatively small doses most of the time, such as in snippets of dialogue between people at Mission Control, and some info is conveyed during a chat that Lovell has with his young son, which comes across very natural, and exactly the way you'd talk to a boy that age, with the side benefit that the audience learns something, too.\n\nFor a poor example of exposition in screenwriting, I'd offer up *Avatar*, specifically the scene where Selfridge info dumps to Dr. Augustine about unobtanium being a highly sought-after resource, and the reason why humans have a presence on Pandora, and how they're on the brink of war with the Na'vi, and so forth.  She listens to all of this as if it's perfectly natural that he's explaining things *that she already knows because she's been working there for years*.  It is just a very ham-fisted way of conveying the current state of affairs on Pandora to the audience, and comes across as incredibly forced and unnatural.  \n\nAnd the thing is, Jake Sully was the newbie on the scene, so it would have made much more sense for Selfridge to have that talk with *him*, rather than with Augustine.  (I know this movie is not highly-regarded in some circles, and it was never considered a masterclass in writing, but I actually liked it, for the most part.  I'm just quibbling with one particular aspect of the script here.)",

        "content": "Every year we end up watching something together as a family, and this year I am going with Paddington 2. \n\nIt feels perfect for kids and adults at the same time. It is funny, kind, simple, and genuinely warm without being loud or stressful. It is the kind of movie everyone can sit through and leave in a better mood, which matters more to me than tradition or hype.\n\nI am curious how others do it. Do you save movies specifically for Christmas Eve, or do you watch them anytime during the holidays? \n\nAnd what is the movie you picked this year and why?\n\nThank you.",

        "content": "Pretty much what the title says. I've been watching a lot of \"older\" movies recently (Gremlins, The Goonies, Halloween, etc) and something about them just feels more fulfilling to watch. Full disclosure, I'm 27 so nostalgia might play a role in it. Still, I've noticed \"newer\" movies often leave me feeling unfulfilled. There are even a few I've watched that have left me feeling nauseous; not from any particular content, but more from color saturation/camera techniques/I don't even know. Does anyone else experience this? Beyond just nostalgia I mean.",

Or the sun is in the shot the whole time and there is horrible contrast and it's straining to watch. ",

        "content": "The first Fast and Furious was actually locked on to the import tuner crowd trend, which was getting popular in the late 90s. If you're not a car guy, you don't realize this fairly accurate under current plot line.\n\nIf you were an American gear head in the 90s, you witnessed this trend with interest (kinda started in Cali and moved into the midwest). You had guys like me who grew up in the 70s thinking that American pushrod V8s were the only way to make power, and now all of a sudden you really had to give respect to 700bhp overhead cam V6s in Supras and Skylines.\n\nIt's really hard to overstate how intelligent Dom's mechanics were to be doing what they were doing in the movie, but that was really happening in the 90s in just a handful of renegade type shops across the country. It was kind of a magical 'coming of age' time for gear heads imo.\n\nYes, the first movie was mainly about cops and robbers, but they had to have hired some consultant who was tapped into this rising trend of Japanese turbo/nitrous muscle cars that could actually turn corners well. To me the first movie was all about the import tuner car counter culture.\n\nThe Fast sequels kind of lost the car enthusiast feel and just became more generic car chase/crime/action movies.\n\nI bet there are other movies where the main plot line is what most viewers focus on, but those who knew the particular trend at the time can see this underlying theme that other people miss the significance of.\n\n",
