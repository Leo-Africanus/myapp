Ive been hospitalized *countless* times so ive had an incredible amount of free time on my hands. I started this post because I couldn't think of *anymore* movies to watch that fit this bill.   \n  \nEdit 2: People don't really appreciate the amount of time being sick gives. Im asking this question in this post because ive already watched *every* popular movie or TV show from the past 30+ years. Most people can only carve out enough time to watch one or two movies a week, i have enough time to watch 5-7 movies a *day.* Being hospitalized as often as me, plus being sick outside of the hospital leaves you with *to much* free time. Honestly, it sucks. Again, im not asking htis because im lost and i need my next movie or show, im asking this because ive literally *run out* of movies and shows.  \n  \nTo be honest, this post is a bit depressing, i appreciate the immense amount of help, but its really putting into perspective all the time lost to this illness.  \n  \nI try googling this sort of thing but looking up \"competence porn\" just gets you... well.. porn. The best way to show off what im thinking is House M.D. im looking for movies or TV shows.  \n  \nIm going to lost everything I've already watched.  \n  \nHouse\nPerson of Interest  \nWhite Collar \nOceans 11 (plus the other ones)  \nInside man  \nSherlock  \nTinker Tailor Soldier Spy  \nCatch Me if You Can  \nHeat  \nThe Killer   \n   \nYou know what the mote is list the more I realize this is my favorite genre and ive probably seen a *lot* of these.  \n   \nHeists, spies, detectives, politic thrillers etc. Any kind of show where the characters are *super* good at something, usually running scams or working their ways around people, or just being better at something.  \n   \nI'll keep adding to this list if I remember more of someone recommends something ive already scene.     \n   \nEdit: reposted because autocorrect.  \n  \nThis list is what I've ALREADY seen.\n   \nThe original Law and Order seasons.  \nThe big short  \nWolf of wall street   \nMoneyball  \nCollateral  \nStar Trek  \nDoctor Who  \nNo country for old man  \nDREDD  \nBeekeeper  \nHunt fir red October (plus all the other Ryan films)  \nBourne series  \nMission impossible series   \nBurn notice  \nAll the presidents man  \nThe accountant   \nBaby driver  \nApollo 13  \nSpotlight  \nLeon the professional   \nThe town  \nDen of thieves  \nThe Martian.  \nThe Pitt  \nMaster and commander  \nArrival  \nMicheal Clayton  \nMad max moves   \nCast away",

It is the most ridiculous part of the movie for me since he looks so silly trying to not stand out in this little car, when he could have probably hotwired another vehicle that would have been less obvious.",

One that you still get goosebumps when you watch on subsequent viewings, cause it's so good?\n\nMy top 3, in order:\n\n3.  The Sixth Sense\n\n2.  The Usual Suspects\n\n1. Primal Fear\n\nInteresting that The Usual Suspects and Primal Fear both had the deceiver acting with a disability to throw everyone off, including the audience.    They also had a little more of a diabolical nature to them compared to Sixth Sense.\n\nWhat are yours?\n\n  \nEdit:  apologies for weird formatting of this post; tried to correct.  Didn't work.

        "title": "Why do most movies about distant or absent parents always end with redemption and forgiveness, when in reality, that\u2019s so rare? Wouldn't it be more meaningful with a different approach ?",
        "content": "Yesterday, I watched a movie called \"I Love America*\"* with Sophie Marceau. It\u2019s about a woman in her fifties trying to start over, struggling with romantic relationships. Alongside that, it tells the story of her childhood growing up with a mother who rarely showed affection and often abandoned her. Obvisously there's a  connection between the two.\n\nThe movie includes some flashbacks that I found succeeded in capturing the emotions of the child she was and how those early wounds still shape her adult life. It really struck a chord with me, as I have a complicated relationship with my own mother.\n\nBut as usual, by the end of the movie, her mother, through one final gift after her death, somehow manages to mend some of the pain she's been carrying. This leads to a kind of posthumous forgiveness that not only brings healing in the present but, as the movie puts it, also transforms the past. I like part of the message saying that changing the past is possible by renewing the way we look at it in the present\u2026 except I don't like the trigger as it rarely plays out like that in real life. There's no posthumous gift, is there ? No love that is given where it was lacking ?\n\nSo why talk about something raw and emotionally honest to end with idealized resolutions? Why is there always that classic scene where the daughter or son finally confronts their parent, and the parent realizes their mistake, apologizes and sometimes becomes a completely different person ? \n\nWouldn\u2019t it be more meaningful to explore how people can move forward in their own way even without apologies, even when there\u2019s no big, cathartic conversation ?",
