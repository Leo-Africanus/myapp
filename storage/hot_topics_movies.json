See the movie only in theaters February 13.\n\n&gt;Set against the sun-bleached grit of Los Angeles, Crime 101 weaves the tale of an elusive thief (Chris Hemsworth) whose high-stakes heists unfolding along the iconic 101 freeway have mystified police. When he eyes the score of a lifetime with hopes of this being his final job, his path collides with a disillusioned insurance broker (Halle Berry) who is facing her own crossroads, forcing the two to collaborate. Determined to crack the case, a relentless detective (Mark Ruffalo) closes in on the operation, raising the stakes even higher. As the multimillion-dollar heist approaches, the line between hunter and hunted begins to blur, and all three are forced to confront the cost of their choices--and the realization that there's no turning back. \n\n&gt;Adapted from Don Winslow\u2019s acclaimed novella of the same name, the film is written and directed by Bart Layton (American Animals, The Imposter). Barry Keoghan, Monica Barbaro, Corey Hawkins, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Nick Nolte round out the cast.",

Was it a shock to see him get blasted and see those liquid metal impacts?\n\n  \nI was 7 when that movie came out so I don't remember the advertising behind it really at all but I sure do remember all the toys that came out.  The trailers I've seen definitely spoil it, but curious if the marketing made it impossible not to know or if people still went in blind.  I think James Cameron did such an amazing job in the first 20 minutes of the movie leaving it ambiguous and hope it had that type of impact on some people.",

        "title": "I've probably watch Dead Poets Society over a 100 times during my adolescence, but I only realized some crazy details today",
        "content": "I just realized something kind of wild. I've probably seen Dead Poets Society a hundred times, but only now do I feel like I'm really understanding certain scenes. Maybe I was too young the first times I watched it, but on rewatch, things hit differently.\n\nFor example, the scene where Keating pushes Todd to improvise a poem in front of the class. For years I just thought it was an inspirational teacher moment, but I didn't get the deeper meaning. Keating tells Todd to look at the picture of W.W, a grim old man staring back, and says, \"Close your eyes. Describe what you see.\" Todd ends up saying: \"...a sweaty-toothed madman... his hands reach out and choke me...\" Back then I didn't realize this was Todd describing himself. His fear of expression, his anxiety, his self-loathing, all of that comes through in the words. Keating didn't just make him speak; he made him reveal himself.\n\nThat blanket image itself takes on a deeper symbolism the more I think about it. Todd says: \"You push at it, stretch it, it will never be enough. You kick at it, beat at it, it will never cover any of us. .\" At first it sounds abstract, but it\u2019s really about truth and acceptance. Keating uses this moment to push Todd to face who he really is. The blanket being too small for everyone becomes a metaphor that truth and self-expression can\u2019t be confined or limited, it\u2019s bigger than any of us. And then the haunting line: \"\u00a0From the moment we enter crying to the moment you leave dying.\", hich suddenly makes me think of birth and death, the painful but inescapable bookends of existence.\n\nThen there\u2019s Neil\u2019s suicide. When I was younger, I understood it was tragic, but I never really thought about the fact that Neil was only seventeen. That\u2019s still a child, and the pressure from his father, the crushing weight of not being able to live his own life, feels even heavier when you remember how young he is. It wasn\u2019t just about the play or his father forbidding him to act it was the loss of hope that he could ever be himself.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the Todd and Neil relationship. For the longest time I thought the idea of people shipping them was just fans being over the top. But looking back, there\u2019s real tension between them. I don\u2019t necessarily think either of them would have consciously recognized it, especially in 1959, but the intimacy is there. Todd\u2019s shyness breaking down under Neil\u2019s encouragement, Neil\u2019s obvious care for Todd, the way their interactions carry more weight than typical school friendships  there\u2019s something more, even if it\u2019s unspoken.\n\nIt\u2019s funny, because the movie hasn\u2019t changed, but I have. Now I see layers that were invisible to me before. Dead Poets Society really is one of those films that grows with you.",

At the time I was so judgmental towards the main character\u2019s decision-making because we were so close in age. I felt like he was making childish, naive decisions in this life or death survival situation and I would have been SO much smarter than him in that position. Just typical know-it-all teenager.\n\nThen I watched it again maybe 3 years ago for the first time since high school. I scared my wife a little I cried so hard at it. Watching it as a grown man it was just so obvious that of course he's making childish decisions; he IS a child. The right or wrong of his choices was totally irrelevant before the tragedy that he was a kid being forced to make decisions no child should have to make. I guess the older I get the younger young people seem to me. Seita is like 14 in the movie? He's practically a baby in my eyes now. And it hit me like a ton of bricks on rewatching it.",
