        "title": "'The Accountant 2' - Review Thread",
        "content": "*Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) has a talent for solving complex problems. When an old acquaintance is murdered, leaving behind a cryptic message to \"find the accountant,\" Wolff is compelled to solve the case. Realizing more extreme measures are necessary, Wolff recruits his estranged and highly lethal brother, Brax (Jon Bernthal), to help.*\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [86%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_accountant_2/reviews)\n\n**Metacritic:** [58/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-accountant-2/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Variety - Owen Glieberman](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/the-accountant-2-review-ben-affleck-1236332243/)\n\n&gt;To me, this franchise had nowhere to go but up. And that, I\u2019m pleased to say, is exactly what happened. The Accountant 2 is an agreeably loopy hyperviolent good time. It is one of the only thrillers I\u2019ve seen you could characterize as a hangout movie.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - Lovia Gyarkye](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-accountant-2-review-ben-affleck-jon-bernthal-1236158676/)\n\n&gt;The puzzle at the center of *The Accountant* *2* matters insofar as the film needs a narrative propellant. But Bernthal and Affleck are the real draw, and O\u2019Connor knows this. He uses any opportunity to get the brothers talking, and follows each major development in the fictional case with a moment of brotherly bonding. And while this critic would have welcomed more restraint in the violence, which can have an inuring effect, fans of the first film will find plenty to admire and root for in this entertaining fraternal union.\n\n[DEADLINE - Glenn Garner](https://deadline.com/2025/03/the-accountant-2-review-ben-affleck-jon-bernthal-sequel-sxsw-1236306104/)\n\n&gt;Although sequels rarely surpass the original, Gavin O\u2019Connor\u2019s long-gestating *The Accountant 2* is a pleasant surprise. The familial dynamics in the movie manage to tug at the heartstrings. And while everyone\u2019s arc might not wrap up the way audiences hope, they all find what they truly need, whether it\u2019s a stray cat, the perfect office chair or some good old fashion vengeance.\n\n[JoBlo's Movie Network - Chris Mumbray](https://www.joblo.com/the-accountant-2-sxsw-review-affleck-and-bernthal-are-a-great-buddy-movie-combo/)\n\n&gt;I\u2019m not complaining, though\u2014as a meat-and-potatoes action fan, I\u2019ve been starving for a film like this. I love the sleek 87North-style action flicks that are in favour now, but *The Accountant 2* is old-school in a way I\u2019ve been missing. The extra emphasis on characterization only sweetens the pot.\n\n[The Guardian - Adrian Horton](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/09/the-accountant-2-review-ben-affleck)\n\n&gt;Still, sentiment aside, this is a movie of cinematic adrenaline and ludicrous set-ups \u2013 ironically for its hero, stupid pleasures, but the fun kind of stupid, the kind that draws loud cheers from a crowd at a SXSW premiere and gets people streaming on the couch. It\u2019s neither groundbreaking nor exceptional, but it does deliver above the admittedly low bar for a questionable sequel, with enough juice for another at-home hit.\n\n[Screen Rant - Graeme Guttmann](https://screenrant.com/the-accoutant-2-review/)\n\n&gt;***The Accountant 2***'s best scenes have nothing to do with guns or hand-to-hand combat. In fact, when I saw the film last night at its SXSW world premiere, the audience was laughing along with it more than they were gasping when Jon Bernthal breaks a man's neck over a cinder block or Ben Affleck smashes a gun into someone's face. It's not at all what I expected, but I think I loved every second of it.\n\n[Slash Film - Ryan Scott](https://www.slashfilm.com/1806843/the-accountant-2-review/)\n\n&gt;Is it sometimes outlandish? Completely, but since when did movies have to be realistic? Escapism often works very well when we can leave reality behind. What I can say with confidence is that anyone who enjoyed \"The Accountant\" will undoubtedly enjoy this follow-up. It's rare that sequels outdo what came before, but O'Connor manages to do so here. This is pure popcorn entertainment, executed effectively. Let me put it this way: If they make three more \"Accountant\" movies, I will watch three more \"Accountant\" movies. Honestly, I hope they do.\n\n[Screen Daily - Tim Grierson](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-accountant-2-review-ben-affleck-and-jon-bernthal-are-back-with-a-winning-formula/5202769.article)\n\n&gt;There\u2019s a B-movie purity to how this franchise conducts its business, eschewing the flash of modern blockbusters for a more pummelling, elemental approach to its shootouts and hand-to-hand fight scenes. On top of that, *The Accountant 2* has added a winning sense of humour to the equation.\n\n[Roger Ebert - Brian Tallerico](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-accountant-2-movie-review-2025)\n\n&gt;The truth is that pacing often trumps realism, and \u201cThe Accountant 2\u201d just doesn\u2019t build enough momentum. I think one of the reasons for that is that O\u2019Connor is far more interested in the brother buddy comedy than the human trafficking action film, and never quite figures out how to blend the two. The film about two very different brothers who try to bridge the chasm of personality between them? Almost completely works. Everything else? Total hokum. Merging the two becomes an assignment too difficult for even The Accountant to decipher.\n\n[Loud and Clear - Wesley Hunt](https://loudandclearreviews.com/the-accountant-2-film-review/)\n\n&gt;If you liked the original *Accountant* for its grit and stunt work, *The Accountant 2* is something radically different in tone and pacing, and may be a bit of a jarring transition. O\u2019Connor\u2019s effort to make a sequel which is not just a remake of the original is commendable, but in terms of **shifting genre from film noir to comedy**, it will appeal to different people for different reasons. There is an argument to be made for either film in the series being the superior installment, and some people will hate the sequel for the same reasons people like it.\u00a0\n\n[The Wrap - Matt Donato](https://www.thewrap.com/the-accountant-2-review-ben-affleck-john-bernthal/)\n\n&gt;\u201cThe Accountant 2\u201d surpasses its original by keying into a lenient and dangerously playful tone. Affleck is charming and vulnerable as Christian in moments where he\u2019s just living everyday life, trying to navigate the anxious minefield of dating or friendships through his exceptional perspective. It\u2019s not the sequel you\u2019d expect, which is a compliment. Bernthal\u2019s the unexpected MVP despite Affleck\u2019s leading role, but the real treat is how \u201cThe Accountant 2\u201d becomes a wholesome and heart-pumping family affair.\n\n[Next Best Picture - Matthew Creith](https://nextbestpicture.com/the-accountant-2/)\n\n&gt;Bernthal and Affleck are top-notch, though, with a whacky script from \u201cThe Accountant\u201d writer Bill Dubuque, returning to the screen with dialogue that belongs more in the \u201cThe Hangover\u201d franchise than a supposedly sleek thriller, hard-hitting action thriller (which is surprisingly light on the action). We know Gavin O\u2019Connor is capable of telling far more compelling stories, as demonstrated in \u201cWarrior,\u201d \u201cMiracle,\u201d and even \u201cThe Way Back,\u201d and although \u201cThe Accountant 2\u201d is funnier than the first, it\u2019s not as engrossing in scope and scale, making it a messy sequel that lacks ambition and ingenuity.\n\n[IndieWire - Christian Zilko](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/the-accountant-2-review-ben-affleck-jon-bernthal-1235102308/)\n\n&gt;At its heart, \u201cThe Accountant 2\u201d is a story of brothers working through their drama through drunken nights at honky tonk bars and deep conversations on the roof of an Airstream. I\u2019m still not convinced this franchise exists for any reason other than Affleck being jealous that Matt Damon won the coin toss to decide who got to play the math genius in \u201cGood Will Hunting,\u201d but it manages to offer more heart and more laughs the second time around.\n\n[The Playlist - Chase Hutchinson](https://theplaylist.net/the-accountant-2-review-ben-affleck-jon-bernthal-fight-for-the-buddy-comedy-in-a-sad-excuse-of-an-action-movie-sxsw-20250309/)\n\n&gt;One hesitates even to call it an action film save for a climactic shootout that feels obligatory more than it does exciting or well-staged; there aren\u2019t any moments of creative fights we get to sit with for more than a few seconds. Much of this is by design, as the film seems to want to be just about the relationship between the two brothers and is at its best when it leans into this, but it also can\u2019t get out of its own way either.\n\n[The Mary Sue - Rachel Leishman](https://www.themarysue.com/the-accountant-2-review/)\n\n&gt;So maybe what I really want is a road trip movie with these two. Or just a buddy cop movie. But without Chris and Brax\u2019s relationship, *The Accountant 2* would feel like a lukewarm sequel that didn\u2019t need to happen. Luckily, we have Bernthal and his iconic grunting fighting style to keep us invested throughout the slightly bloated runtime.",

Avoiding spoilers and not knowing any scenes is a bonus.\n\nMost of the time I don't even read synopsis, i always go blind into the movies now (of course if it's not known widely what it is about) and it's been great.",

The closest movie that comes to mind that I enjoyed would probably be Knives Out. Agatha Christie adaptations might also be a close fit, though I haven\u2019t seen many.\n\nI love the slapstick elements of Clue, but don\u2019t necessarily need that to scratch this itch. Ideally the key elements would be old-money aesthetics with elements of mystery/suspense.",

        "content": "***EDIT #4- Putting this at the top because it's an important development: she wants me to clarify that she hasn't always disliked ALL animated films. She liked the first Toy Story (although hasn't shown any interest in the sequels) and swears i convinced her to watch \"a movie about two girls and there were race cars (?what?).\" Also, anime is back on the table for some reason, so that opens up a lot of possibilities.\n\n\n***EDIT-this has gotten way more traction than I expected. I appreciate everyone 's input so far and it's unlikely I'll be able to respond to everyone. A couple of notes:\n\n1- I don't know exactly why she doesn't like animation. She just can't seem to get interested. I've tried in the past, I have. It hasn't captured her attention.\n\n2- Despite some very good recommendations, I'd like to avoid traumatizing her completely (Grave of the Fireflies, for example)\n\n3- She likes a variety of genres, so it's hard to narrow it down. She's also incredibly difficult to shop for, in the same way. She's very much a \"I'll know what I like when I see it\" person.\n\n****EDIT #2- Some great options so far. Lead contenders right now are probably Up, Wild Robot, Wall-E, Spiderverse, Incredibles, Iron Giant, Flow (I haven't seen this one yet either), Shrek.\n\nAbsolute no-no's, and you should be ashamed of yourselves (you know who you are) Heavy Metal, Watership Down, Grave of the Fireflies\n\n****EDIT #3- I've tried in the past. I thought we were on to something when she said she'd watch the Buzz Lightyear movie, but that was a stinker and she hasn't tried again since then.\n*.*.*.*\n\n\nMy wife has never enjoyed animated movies, so I'll usually watch any animated films on my own when they're released on a streaming service. She has just told me that I can pick any one animated film for us to watch together. Anime and any significantly older film (like classic Disney) won't fly. What should it be? I think it's got to be something that hits deep emotionally. Up? Wild Robot? What are your thoughts? \n\nThis could be my only chance to add animated films to out list of watchables.",

        "content": "This may not resonate with some of our younger readers for whom race relations has been explored in detail over the past 50 years or so.  But try to go back 50 years.  Until 1967 interracial marriage was illegal in some states until  Loving vs Virginia where the Supreme Court struck down a 1883 decision legalizing these laws.  Jackie Robinson became the first black major league baseball player just 20 years earlier.\n\nSo looking from that point of view. let's look at these three movies and his performances.  \n\nIn the Heat of the Night has true vistuoso performances by Poitier and Rod Steiger.  Steiger as the bigoted sheriff, Poitier as the black detective Virgil Tibbs.  A must see for pure raw emotion.   After thoroughly demolishing the Sheriff's railroading of someone in front of the widow of the murder victim and the very important owner of the town factory.  Like other ignorant bullies, he falls back on name-calling and demonizing the other.\n\nSheriff: \"Virgil, that's a funny name for a nigger boy that comes from Philadelphia.  What do they call you there\" \n\nTibbs: \"They call me Mister Tibbs\"\n\nGuess Who's Coming to Dinner is a less emotional, more reasoned approach to race relations.  Also having Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn was great.\n\nTo Sir With Love, may be best remembered now for the theme song by Lulu looks at disenfranchised youths and racism.  Shows the power of respect, for ourselves and others.",

I want films where the main conflict is man vs. nature, with characters struggling against the elements, isolation, and the psychological toll of survival. Where the environment should feel like an ever-present threat, not just a backdrop.\n\n\nSomething where the tension comes from both physical dangers\u2014like predators or extreme weather\u2014and the slow breakdown of the human body and mind. Cinematography that emphasizes bleak, desaturated landscapes and minimal, atmospheric sound design is a plus. I also like when fire is used as a symbol of survival, and when characters are pushed to their limits, questioning their place in the world.\n\n\nAny recommendations for survival thrillers that focus on harsh natural environments, where survival feels like a battle of endurance rather than victory? The previous three above, alongside The Revenant and Alive are sort of what I\u2019m looking for. \n\n\nIf you\u2019re a gamer, I want to watch \u201cThe Long Dark\u201d as a movie. Thanks!",
