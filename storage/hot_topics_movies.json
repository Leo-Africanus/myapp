The chemistry between the cast is fantastic, Jonah Hill and Channing \"Tateyum\" play off each other so well and seems to have had a great time filming.\n\nNic Offerman as Deputy Chief Hardy is just incredible casting. The not so subtle jabs at Hollywood remakes is hilarious. \n\nAlso I didn't recognize Dakota Johnson...I must of been finger poppin' somebody's asshole and didn't notice.\n\nThe scene stealer is Ice Cube. Every line he has is gold and is insanely quotable.\n\nIt such a shame the MIB/21 Jump Street crossover never came to fruition...anyways I'm off to watch 22 Jump Street.",

They tell stories that are highly charged with emotion and thus lend themselves to making the audience cry. But then there are movies where crying is seemingly not the intention, and yet you can't help but feel your eyes well up in tears.\n\nThe Godfather Part 2 is called a lot of things: The best sequel ever made, one of the best movies of the 70's, The Great American Movie. But a tearjerker? From the outset it doesn't really look it. And yet, if you find yourself sucked into Michael Corleone's inner turmoil as I was, it becomes surprisingly easy to become emotional the further along you go in. ESPECIALLY when&gt;!Michael gives the implicit order to kill Fredo, and before he meets his inevitable fate, his attempts to connect with Michael's son.!&lt;I'll admit, I wept. I wept pretty hard, and I did NOT expect that reaction from The Godfather 2. What movie was like that for you?",

It planted this seed of doubt... like,\u00a0**what if I'm just an NPC?**\u00a0What if most of us regular folks are just background characters in some massive simulation or game?\n\nIt's made me look at the world differently ever since. Maybe those super-rich people or powerful politicians constantly\u00a0**on the feed**\u00a0aren't just regular people, but the\u00a0actual\u00a0players? The ones with\u00a0**P2W (Pay-to-Win)**\u00a0advantages, or maybe even avatars controlled by the\u00a0**devs/admins**\u00a0running the whole show, walking among us\u00a0**IRL**?\n\nIt's a properly chilling thought that these movies planted in my brain all that time ago, and it genuinely still gives me goosebumps just thinking about it.\n\nAnyone else have a movie do this to them? Left you with a deep unease or a creepy thought that revisits you long after you watched it? Which ones were they?\n\n**TL;DR:**\u00a0**The Truman Show**\u00a0and\u00a0**Westworld**\u00a0still creep me out years later, making me wonder if we're NPCs and the rich/powerful are the real players/admins.

        "content": "Buster Keaton being famous for his courage and willignness to pull of some crazy stunts, giving us some of the best slapstick and stunt comedy films ever made. To this date there hasn't been anybody nearly at his level (and courage) to pull off some of the things he did. \n\nThe closest to him currently is Tom Cruise who has become well known (among other things) for his own willingness to pull of some crazy stunts. As the Mission Impossible series has shown us, as well as Top Gun and other films, Tom Cruise is always pushing his own limits and challenging his own capabilities in his stunt work, all for the sake of cinema. \n\nFor that reason, I would LOVE to see a modern Buster Keaton style slapstick film, feeling like Tom Cruise is the only one with the capability to pull it off. What made Buster Keaton films so great was both the stunts and also the dry deadpan humor. Keaton's stoicism to the chaos around him is something we've seen with Leslie Nielsen in Airplane/Naked Gun. \n\nLeslie Nielsen experienced a career renaissance that made him a household name in comedy, despite having no comedic chops himself. Simply because he used deadpan humor and being the every man who pretends like everything is normal as the chaos unfolds around him.\n\nThis is where I think Tom Cruise would be perfect to do a Buster Keaton style film. As an action star Tom Cruise isn't well known for his comedic chops, but he doesn't need to be. He can maintain the deadpan seriousness and stoicism of Buster Keaton and Leslie Nielson reacting to the craziness happening around him and showing off his stunting capabilities in increasingly absurd situations.

        "content": "I was made to watch *The King of Kings* yesterday, and I\u2019m still processing the fact that someone watched *The Passion of the Christ* and thought:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s do that again. But make it adorable.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no mystery to what this is\u2014it\u2019s a sermon dressed as an animated film. Imagine if *The Prince of Egypt* had less artistry, less heart, and more of that weird Sunday school energy where you\u2019re afraid to ask questions. That\u2019s this.\n\nThe movie starts with Charles Dickens (yes, really) telling his kids bedtime stories about Jesus, which somehow becomes the framing device for a full-on Gospel recap. The animation? Think *Pixar meets Playmobil*. Big heads. Smooth, rubbery faces. That eerie uncanny valley where everyone looks like they were designed in a Christian metaverse.\n\nBut the tone is the real kicker. One second you\u2019re watching cartoon kids giggle at the manger. The next, Jesus is being flogged behind a post by a dead-eyed Roman doll with a whip. When they lift Funko-Jesus onto the cross, I actually said \u201cno way\u201d out loud.\n\nThis movie in the (un)holy baby of tonal mismatch and weird choices: Roman officials are \u201ccomplex,\u201d but every Jewish character who questions Jesus is a full-on villain with the face of a propaganda sketch. That\u2019s not subtext. That\u2019s just text.\n\nTo be clear: If you want to show this to your kids, fine. But don\u2019t pretend this is a movie. It\u2019s a delivery system for doctrine. And at times, it feels like the kind of doctrine that doesn\u2019t trust children to think for themselves.\n\nThis\u2019ll be sold as wholesome family entertainment. Personally? I think it\u2019s a little terrifying.",

        "content": "I came across it on youtube and have always been intrigued by it. I was sleepy but I started it just to watch a little of it, and I couldn\u2019t stop. This movie fucked me up. \n\nThe level of desperation and hopelessness in this is powerful as hell. Every actor in the cast is outstanding , but Jane Fonda gives possible a career best performance (and it\u2019s one of her earlier ones), Susannah York is haunting and flawlessly portrays a woman who\u2019s psyche is slowly being destroyed, and Gig Young rightfully won an Oscar for his performance. What happened to him later in his life (murder/suicide) just adds another layer of dread. \n\nSydney Pollocks direction is phenomenal.  The editing, the pacing, the palpable hell of the scenario is genuinely unsettling and unsparing. It feels like a waking nightmare. The fact it is based on the real dance marathons during the depression is just so devastating. Humanity at its worst and most frail. \n\nThe ending lands at least five big gut punches and left me so overwhelmed, but I loved every moment of it. This has instantly found its way into my favorite films of all time, but it will probably be a while before another viewing. It\u2019s impossible to forget , though. \n\nFinally, the greatest punch in the face is how timely and relevant it remains , despite being a film from the 60s, about the great depression a few decades earlier. I kept thinking of all of those Mr. Beast competitions, it\u2019s sickening. \n\nI\u2019ll leave it at that for now, but definitely check it out if you haven\u2019t. But if you\u2019re in a bad frame of mind maybe wait until you\u2019re in a better mood. It\u2019s an uncommonly harrowing experience, and it doesn\u2019t pull any punches. ",

So bad it\u2019s good as they say. No offense to Josh Peck but him as Chris Hemsworth\u2019s brother is less believable than Chris Hemsworth actually being Thor. Most of the acting is cringey but for some reason I still enjoy watching. Any else love it because it\u2019s so bad? Or does everyone just hate it.",
