No legit A-listers yet it was a hit because the story was enough. Sure, maybe if Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks were in it, it may have been a bigger hit or maybe folks would buy it less with the performances.\n\nAlso, Starship Troopers which had a 100 million dollar budget back in 1997 and was R-rated and had no stars whatsoall unless you count Doogie Howser. I gotta imagine that was a risky move selling it to the studio yet it was made.\n\nWhat are some other big budget films that have practically no stars in the lead role?",

Something about it has really just stuck with me, maybe it\u2019s the creepy imagery of the villain and twisted 90\u2019s tv show aesthetic. \n\nJustice Smith\u2019s characters narration about being young then suddenly growing old really just hit me like a brick wall. I'm a nostalgic person that grew up with 90's shows and that sequence just broke me, especially thinking on how quickly life has moved these past few years. \n\nThe entire theme of his character not being able to embrace who he truly is or wants to be and living a life suppressing himself haunts me. I\u2019m a straight male and I know the film is about trans identity yet it really connected with me. The entire ending sequence was so casual and yet so horrific. I know this movie isn\u2019t for everyone, but man I just can\u2019t stop thinking about it. I feel like there's so many different interpretations and things you can take from this film.",

A friend recommended it, so I bought it on Prime.\n\nI went into it completely blind, so I had no idea about the plot besides the fact that it involved a love triangle, so I expected some kind of shallow sexy drama.\n\nI've never watched Euphoria and I had only seen Zendaya in Dune, and I wasn't impressed, but she's great in this. It's funny to see how she clearly doesn't love either of them, and is just in love with tennis.\n\nI also loved **Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' electronic soundtrack** and how it highlights emotions and moments of tension, especially when the characters are fighting. But the thing I liked the most was the portrayal of the boys' friendship and overall rapport, which looks and sounds, for lack of a better word, real. Especially in the flashbacks from their teenage years the dialogue and the acting make their relationship sound very realistic.\n\nI felt stupid at the end when the credits rolled out and it showed that Guadagnino was the director. Maybe it's because I was very busy this year, but I didn't know he had directed this (shameful for an Italian). I guess that explains the eroticism of it.",

Just wanted to let everyone know it's available on Prime Video for the next few days, and ask if anyone else absolutely adores this movie. If you haven't seen it, it's a TON of fun for all ages. Gonna have this one playing all Thanksgiving day, along with my newly aquired DVD copy of Young Frankenstein! Happy Holidays! ",

        "title": "Jay and Silent Bob: Rosencrantz and Guildenstern meet Cheech and Chong",
        "content": "I'd just like to start this post with a message for Mr. Affleck. He seems to have fallen on tough times. **Affleck - you were the bomb in Phantoms**\n\n(Tangent - I saw Phantoms in the theatres because of Mallrats and Chasing Amy)\n\nIn 1997 Kevin Smith released Chasing Amy. This absolute gem of a movie has aged incredibly well and is maybe a better movie today than it was when it came out. It has aged like wine. But this isn't about that movie. That movie is relevant because it included an exchange between a hardcore comic fan discussing with a very very very bored Ben Affleck the characters Blunt-man and Chronic:\n\n* \"I love this book man!  This shit's awesome.  I wish I was like these guys... getting stoned, talking all raw about chicks and fighting supervillains!  I love these guys!  They're like 'Cheech and Chong' meet 'Bill and Ted'!\n* I like to Think of them as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern' meet Vladimir and Estragon'.\"\n\n(Sidenote: Regardless of what you may think of either this post, Kevin Smith, or Jay and Silent Bob, I do recommend watching the first 5-10 minutes of that movie (if you can find it) because it's absolutely hilarious. These 5 minutes spawned countless memes that would persist for decades with most people not even knowing this is where they came from.) \n\n**Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back**\n\nWho knew that in 4 years that dream merger would come to pass in Jay and Silent Bob strikes back. This movie is definitely in the Dirty Work, Billy Madison, Tenacious D, vein of \"There is a plot. But not really\". The movie exists to be funny. I thought this movie wouldn't have aged well as we have gone a long way since 2001. Somehow, someway this movie threads that line in a way similar to 30 Rock or Tropic Thunder where the characters are doing pretty questionable things but managed to make that the joke. I'd say most of the humor holds up amazingly well even to this day. The stuff that seems to stick out the most/aged the worst is the 4th wall camera break stuff, but these aren't super common. Other than that, most jokes elicit a chuckle at least. It's not quite 30 rock levels of joke per minute but it's in the ball park. And once again, this movie is just full of memorable meme-able scenes.\n\n* Jay's mom scene at the beginning? Funny\n* Jay singing the fuck song? Funny.\n* Jay farting on the cop after telling him to smell his stink nuggets? Funny\n* The whole Ben Affleck scene is hilarious. \"Look at these two morose motherfuckers right here. Smells like someone shit in their cereal...BONG! That was good. Come on in\". \"What brings you two dirt merchants to my neck of the woods\". \"What the fuck is the internet? The internet is a communication tool used the world over where people can come together to bitch about movies and share pornography with each other.\" \"Here we go, moviepoopshoot.com. Heh...poopshoot\".\n*\"Any movie based on Jay and Silent Bob will lick balls because they both, in fact, lick balls\"\n* Peak Shannon Elizabeth.\n* Peak-ish Eliza Dushku\n* Sneaky Peak Tracy Morgan\n* Mid Chris Rock\n* Peak-ish Jamie Kennedy\n* Maybe  Peak Deirdrich Bader\n* Peak Morris Day and the Time\n* Peak Sean William Scott\n\nI could go on...The movie is hilarious. \n\nLook. It's stupid. It's really really really dumb. But, it's kind of the point. It's just supposed to be a funny movie. Dogs Playing Poker is stupid. And Dogs Playing Poker is Art. Am I saying Jay and Silent Bob is Art? Yes. Am I saying it's as good as Dogs playing Poker? Don't be silly. But, of all of these zany 90/00's era comedies I keep coming back to this one the most and I continue to laugh at everything I always have.\n\nI will say. I haven't kept up with his current works as much. He seems to have an almost patreon type career with his fans. Which is pretty cool. But, I mainly Stilgar the first 5.\n\n**Off Topic Notes**\n\n* What the fuck happened with Jason Lee man? Coming out of these first 4-5 Kevin Smith I thought Jason Lee was going to be Paul Rudd. But before Paul Rudd. And it just didn't happen. The guy still had a very good career but just not what I would have envisioned. \n* What the fuck happened with Joey Lauren Adams? You telling me some of those Renee Zellweger roles couldn't have gone Joey Lauren Adam's way? Honestly, go watch Chasing Amy. If she had Renee Zellweger's brand name she would have been nominated for a damn Oscar.\n* I feel Kevin Smith, in general, doesn't get enough credit for these first 5 movies. I know he has an outsized personality and presence now compared to most of these movies, but don't let that color your perceptions of these movies. They are just hilarious movies. \n* Off off topic - This is also how I feel about John Cusack. I have no clue how that guy wasn't a bigger deal. Grosse Point Blank is almost proto-John Wick. Also, his commentary on the current geo political system is very prescient. Also...Peak Mimi Driver. It's insane...maybe I'll do that movie next...\n* I think Mallrats is Peak Peak Shannon Doherty. This is my favorite thing she's ever done. And probably had an outsized impact on my taste in women. I appreciate when a chick will just say \"Get your shit together you fucking dumbass.\"\n* Also, I made it this entire time without even mentioning Dogma. Unfortunately, I would get entirely sidetracked by that movie. It's fucking awesome. But, unless you break the law you can't even watch it. Though, I think that's about to change due to Harvey Weinstein being a piece of shit. But with less money than before.\n\nAll that being Said, Kevin Smith is like The Farrelly Brothers meets Wes Anderson.\n\nAlso - **Aflleck was the bomb in Phantoms**",

        "content": "Home Alone is renowned for covering plot holes: the ticket being thrown away, the power going out. However, watching Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, Kevin never told his family that he fought Harry and Marv in the events covered by the first movie. \n\nAll throughout the second film, his family only ever describes him as being left alone during Christmas\u2014never once do they refer to the fact that he fought off two thieves while he was home alone. The only witness to Kevin fighting the thieves was the old man with the snow shovel. One would think that he would have discussed the ordeal with Kevin\u2019s parents. \n\nIt begs the question why Kevin and the neighbor withheld this information from Kevin\u2019s family. A plot hole? Or, alternatively, is there a possibility that Kevin hallucinated the entire events of the first and second films? \n\nEdit: Thanks for all the responses. I am going to be more careful about labeling things as plot holes in the future. Merry Christmas ya\u2019 filthy animals. ",
