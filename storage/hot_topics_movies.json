It just did nothing for me at all the story I understood what was going on but it just didn\u2019t grip me at all and I just didn\u2019t find it as spooky scary enough to keep me entertained. Said to my friend group I was disappointed and when they all had seen it gave me the \u201cyou just didn\u2019t understand what was going on\u201d or I must of been confused when watching it so it wasn\u2019t as good.

        "content": "I'll begin by saying that I am not referencing the premise of the movie. Of course, the technology presented was too futuristic but that's beside the point. I'm referring to the insane plot choices that had me cackling throughout the playtime. This wasn't even close to my first time seeing Face/Off but below are some of the things that made me realize how dumb (still a fun watch) this movie really is. \n\n  \n1.) Although they make it clear that it's not only Archer's face they will be changing during his secret procedure, I don't think they emphasized that every single aspect of his outward appearance would be changed. You see him get his scar removed (back to this later) but Troy was sleeping with Archer's wife while wearing his face. That would imply that they either have the exact same sexual anatomy, his wife is completely clueless, or they surgically made Archer's body identical to Troy's. \n\n2.) Throughout the entire film, Archer and Troy shoot thousands of rounds at each other, try and blow each other up, etc. While I get Archer wanted revenge, the two of them clearly didn't care if they were going to get their real face back as I can't imagine the surgery they both received would be able to just fix a shot up face. If their goal was to get their identities back, firing bullets with little to no aim seems like the wrong approach. \n\n3.) Speaking of the shootout scenes, the FBI gives ZERO fucks about children as seen when they raid Troy's friends hideout. Adam almost got shot in every part of that scene. \n\n4.) Random callout but with hindsight, having Danny Masterson play the guy who assaults Jamie was a bad call. \n\n5.) The absolutely most absurd part of this entire movie was Archer's starting motivation and the ending of the movie. Clearly, Archer's vendetta against Troy was due to Archer's son being killed. When he goes in for his first surgery, he asks to not have his scar removed as it reminded him of his lost son and the reason he was doing the secret assignment in the first place. Cut to Archer meets Adam, Troy's biological son, who reminds him of his boy. Adam's mom dies, Archer kills Troy, yada yada. When Archer is finally getting his surgery to get back to his normal appearance, he says he doesn't need the scar back anymore. Fine. A little strange seeing as how important it was at the beginning of the film but maybe Troy being dead will help him and his family move on and remember his boy together. Then you cut to Archer returning home to his family and realize he's been making this essentially random kid (Adam) wait on the porch for him to call him in and announce him as their replacement son to the family's delight. \n\n  \n10/10 would highly recommend",

But in the case of My Neighbor Totoro I believe it ruins one of my favorite moments in any movie. \n\nSPOILER BELOW\n\nInstead of seeing the incredibly touching moment of the Mom returning home from the hospital with her children Satsuki and Mei leaping to hug her\u2026.HBO Max has decided that instead it should be a bunch of little boxes trying to get me to click on another program to watch. \n\nI guess this just scores 1 more point for the superiority of physical media but it still shouldn\u2019t be this way.

No one actually does that. \n\nCan anyone identify with this? Any other good suggestions?",

        "title": "March 7-9 Box Office Recap: 'Mickey 17' flops with an underwhelming $19 million domestically and a weak $53.3 worldwide total, against a $118 million budget. 'Ne Zha 2' crosses $2 billion in China.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/aofa0t30pxne1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=367e3fc800286c66b0f76329f8703a94f53e9972\n\nIt was a very weak start for the month of March.\n\nWith incredibly weak competition, Bong Joon-ho's ***Mickey 17*** topped the box office, but it still proved to be the latest sci-fi flop at the box office. There were 3 other wide releases, all of which flopped as well. Needless to say, it was brutal.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $49.2 million this weekend. That's an awful 62.4% drop from last year, when ***Kung Fu Panda 4*** topped the box office. This weekend is also barely up from last week, when there was just one wide release.\n\nOpening at #1, WB's ***Mickey 17*** flopped with just $19 million in 3,807 theaters. These numbers are eerily similar to the box office failures of other sci-fi films like ***Jupiter Ascending*** ($18.3 million), ***Ad Astra*** ($19 million), and ***The Creator*** ($14 million). The only comfort is that it was Bong Joon-ho's biggest debut, but that's not saying much considering his prior films all opened in limited release. And it cost more than all his films ($118 million).\n\nThe failure of ***Mickey 17*** isn't surprising. There's a risk in opening a new sci-fi film, citing the failure of the previously mentioned titles. Even though ***Mickey 17*** is based on a book, it was treated as an original title anyway. So the film's disappointing numbers are another hit at the argument that audiences crave for new and original films.\n\nBong is popular with the cinephile audience; there was enormous interest in seeing what he would do after the colossal success of ***Parasite***. But it's been 5 years since that film won Best Picture, and it appears that the public moved on. This film was originally set for March 2024, but it faced many delays. WB reportedly spent $80 million in marketing the film, and while it properly sells the film, many were taken aback by the film's humor and tone. Even though this is consistent with Bong's films, perhaps the audience was expecting something more serious, as sci-fi comedies are very niche. \n\nThis also brings up the topic of star power. Robert Pattinson is definitely popular, thanks to his roles in franchises like ***Harry Potter***, ***Twilight*** and ***The Batman***. But the thing is that his roles as leading man in non-IPs have not translated to box office success. Most of his films have been limited releases, and his last box office hit besides the three previously mentioned was ***Water for Elephants***, which came out back in 2011. This is not something exclusive to Pattinson, given that a lot of actors have struggled to open original titles. Reviews were positive (78% on RT), but not strong enough to convince those skeptical.\n\nAccording to Warner Bros., 65% of the audience was male and 71% was 25 and over. They gave it a middling \"B\" on CinemaScore, which is neither bad nor great. There's a strong chance ***Mickey 17*** could be front-loaded, given that its Thursday previews ($2.5 million) should've guaranteed a $20+ million debut and it fell far short of it. For now, a $50 million domestic total is likely for ***Mickey 17***, marking the latest box office misfire for WB.\n\nAfter topping the box office for three weekends, ***Captain America: Brave New World*** had to go to second place. It dropped 44%, adding $8.3 million this weekend. That's a fine drop, although it would've been ideal if it happened far sooner. Through almost one month, the film has earned $176.4 million, and it should get close to $200 million. Better than its second weekend suggested, but still not really a win.\n\nIn third place, Focus Features' ***Last Breath*** dropped 48%, adding $4 million this weekend. Through ten days, the film has amassed $14.5 million so far, and it should finish with over $20 million by the end of its run.\n\nIn fourth place, Neon's ***The Monkey*** eased 39% this weekend, adding $3.9 million this weekend. The film has earned $31 million domestically, and it has already passed ***I, Tonya*** ($30 million) to become Neon's third highest film ever.\n\n***Paddington in Peru*** had its best drop yet. It eased just 18% this weekend, adding $3.7 million. The film has earned $36.8 million, and it should close with around $45 million domestically.\n\nDreamWorks' ***Dog Man*** dipped a light 20%, earning $3.3 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $88.6 million so far, and it's fighting to hit the $100 million milestone.\n\nAfter earning 5 Oscar wins, Best Picture winner ***Anora*** got expanded to 1,938 theaters. The film earned $1.8 million, taking its domestic total to $18.3 million. Quite impressive, considering it has been on digital platforms since December.\n\n***Mufasa*** refuses to leave the Top 10. It eased just 16% this weekend, adding $1.6 million. With this, it has crossed $250 million domestically.\n\nAngel Studios also opened ***Rule Breakers*** in 2,044 theaters, but it flopped with just $1.5 million. That's one of the worst debuts for a film playing at over 2,000 theaters, and translates to a very poor $736 per-theater average. Even with an \"A\" on CinemaScore, this film will disappear quickly from theaters.\n\nRounding up the Top 10 was another flop. It was Paul W.S. Anderson's new film, ***In the Lost Lands***, which debuted with a meager $1 million in 1,370 theaters. That's Anderson's worst debut ever, even below ***Monster Hunter*** ($2 million), which came out during terrible conditions in December 2020. Expect this to fade quickly.\n\nWhat's worse than 3 wide releases flopping? 4 wide releases flopping. Viva Pictures released ***Night of the Zoopocalypse*** into 1,400 theaters, but it earned just $804,370 this weekend. Pathetic.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Mickey 17*** also made its appearance worldwide, but it was very unimpressive. The film debuted with $24.5 million overseas; adding its South Korean numbers from last week, the film has earned a weak $53.3 million worldwide. It had very soft debuts in France ($2.9M), the UK ($2.7M), Germany ($1.3M) and Mexico ($1.3M). Its biggest market, unsurprisingly, is South Korea with $14.6 million so far. With these numbers, it's clear ***Mickey 17*** won't be a box office success.\n\n***Captain America: Brave New World*** has added $9.2 million overseas, taking its worldwide numbers to $371 million. The best markets are the UK ($21.2M), Mexico ($14.5M), China ($14.3M), France ($12.8M) and South Korea ($11.2M). The film might actually cross $400 million, although it's still far from breaking even.\n\n***Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy*** added $7.3 million, allowing it to cross $103.8 million in the overseas markets. Its best marekts are the UK ($51.1M), Australia ($8.6M), Netherlands ($5M), Poland ($4.8M) and Germany ($4.1M). \n\nBack in China, ***Ne Zha 2*** made history by crossing $2 billion in the country. In the process, it already passed ***Avengers: Infinity War*** to become the sixth highest grossing film worldwide.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Conclave* | Oct/25 | Focus Features | $6,601,995 | $32,580,655 | $104,360,856 | $20M\n\n- ***Conclave*** has ended its run with a fantastic $104 million worldwide. That's a great result for an adult drama, and a sign that there's an audience for films like this. Whether you like the film or not, it's great that a film like this could find an audience instead of being sent to straight-to-streaming.\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nWe've got three wide releases this weekend, and there's a strong chance that there won't be a single film hitting $10 million this weekend.\n\nThe first is Paramount's action comedy ***Novocaine***, which stars Jack Quaid as a bank executive with the inability to feel pain who goes out to rescue his coworker after she is taken hostage by a group of bank robbers. The film has already screened for critics, and reviews are quite solid (89% on RT). A possible sleeper hit?\n\nThe other release is Steven Soderbergh's newest film, Focus Features' ***Black Bag***. It stars Cate Blanchett, Michael Fassbender, Marisa Abela, Tom Burke, Naomie Harris, Reg\u00e9-Jean Page, and Pierce Brosnan, and follows an intelligence agent who suspect his wife might be a traitor. Soderbergh is coming off ***Presence***, which made just $9.2 million, becoming one of his lowest grossing titles. Focus has emphasized action and intrigue, and the reviews are currently on fire (91% on RT), so this should have no problem in opening far higher.\n\nFinally, there's ***The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie***. In a twist of fate, WB is not handling this movie, deciding to sell it off instead. The distributor is Ketchup Entertainment, a recent company that hasn't had box office success in the past few years. And it's unlikely this movie changes that trajectory.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",
