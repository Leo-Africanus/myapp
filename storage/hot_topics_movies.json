You change one little thing and the future can change drastically. \n\nAnd yet ... The main character, in a situation where he wants to prove to someone that he has special Jesus like powers, goes back to his own childhood to a moment in class and makes a drastic change by violently mutilating himself in front of everyone, and then *ZIP* somehow we're back to the same point in the future and the only thing that changed was that he now has scars on his hands?!?\n\nWHACK\n\nAnyone have some other candidates?",

Like in Die Hard with a Vengeance, some kid is like \"it's Christmas, you could steal City Hall\" and McClane is like \"OHHHHHHH, that's what the bad guys are doing\". Contrived way to push a plot forward, but I can enjoy it for being \"movie\" logic.",

        "title": "'Apocalypse Now' is one of the greatest - if not THE greatest - cinematic experiences I've ever had",
        "content": "An ever-degrading fever dream. That's what watching Apocalypse Now I felt like. It probably didn't help that I watched it while coming down from a fever, sweating and a little uncomfortable, with an overcast, drizzling sky outside - but damn, the *atmosphere* this movie creates is second to none.\n\nIt's a bad trip that gets worse and worse, as Willard and his crew undertake their hellish odyssey down the river to find Kurtz. I've read Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, and I was aware that Apocalypse Now is loosely based on that story. It's a masterful interpretation of that story, widening the scope and scale and making it feel somehow even more sinister.\n\nA lot of this is due to how the movie *looks.* Apocalypse Now might be the most visually stunning movie I've ever watched. It's frankly insane to me that it came out almost *50* years ago because it would still blow away pretty much anything released by even the best directors today. It looks so bold, lush and vibrant, with incredible shot composition and lighting. A sickly orange-yellow glow suffuses the landscape, and mist and fog always shrouds the horizon. It's like the characters are traversing through hell, and it adds to the dreamlike feel of the movie.\n\nIt also has one of my favourite cinematic interpretations of war in a movie. Sure, it shows war as bad, and Americans as imperialists and all of that. But more than that, in Apocalypse Now, war is much more abstract, a dark, primordial force that acts as both catalyst and conduit for humanity's darkest urges. It affects everyone. Killgore, Kurtz, the boys on the boat, Willard. Everyone becomes a beast prowling through the jungle. \n\nMarlon Brando's limited screen time is as impressive as advertised - both the writing and his performance, along with how he's shot - portray him as almost a mythical figure out of a twisted fairy tale. Kurtz is more a concept and an idea than a man. Martin Sheen is more restrained, but you can always see the madness just under the surface.\n\nAnd there's that steadily escalating nightmare-feel of the movie, and what makes it so damn incredible. Each sequence and set piece feels more surreal, bleak and unhinged than the last, culminating with the ritual slaughter/assassination at the temple that's one of the most jaw-dropping scenes I've seen in a long time. Honestly, even if you choose not to overanalyze the movie or interpret what it's trying to say, I think it would still be a 5-star watch based simply on the power of its audiovisual presentation alone. It's such a staggering achievement in filmmaking, I can't say enough about it.\n\nNote: I watched the 2 hr 27 min. theatrical cut. At some point in the future I'll probably check out Redux or The Final Cut",

The intricate mythology, disparate characters forced to come together and evolve throughout the series (ELIZABETH'S ARC!!!), practical effects and brilliant CGI deserve far more love.\n\nThese weren't just serviceable action flicks. They're arguably the peak of Disney's blockbuster filmmaking. So many real sets, beautifully built ships, incredible practical effects, CGI that holds up and jaw-dropping set pieces. It paved the way for a lot of modern effects. \n\nFurthermore, these feel like true gateway films for tweens to get into more serious and darker films. Some of the imagery in Dead Man's Chest specifically is legitimately horrifying and feels like it belongs in a gothic horror. At World's End opens on a literal child execution.\n\nThese films were bold, ballsy and incredibly mounted yet rarely discussed. While I wouldn't go as far to say they're LOTR-tier or as narratively cohesive, they deserve to be in the discussion.\n\nIt feels like the installments post 'World's End' tarnished people's perception of these legitimately great films, which is a shame.",

With things like weather conditions, cast or crew not getting along, special effects not working properly, delays, just a generally unpleasant experience, etc.\n\nThe original Texas Chainsaw Massacre comes to mind right away. That film's Hellish shoot has practically become the stuff of legends. [The Shocking Truth documentary](https://tubitv.com/movies/559826/texas-chain-saw-massacre-the-shocking-truth) goes into tremendous detail about it. It's incredible what the crew put up with during the shoot, but at least an important and influential film came out of it.\n\nJaws is another that's well-known for it's incredibly tough shoot. Especially in regards to shooting the Orca scenes in the ocean, and the frequently malfunctioning mechanical shark. Which of course led to one of the film's greatest strengths as the shark's presence was instead psychologically suggested rather than shown, which made the shark's more numerous appearances during the third act that much more impactful when you hadn't seen too much of it up to that point and by then were so invested in the story and characters. Another film that despite the difficult production, the end result speaks for itself.",

Everyone involved in this movie from Travolta to Sonnenfeld deserved their flowers for this kitschy little ode to Hollywood. \n\nThey did the source material justice. \n\nWhy doesn\u2019t Hollywood make these kinds of movies anymore?\n",

Prot acts and talks like he really could be from another planet, but the stuff about Robert Porter's past makes the trauma angle pretty convincing too.\n\nSo what do you think? \nWas Prot truly an alien, or was it all a coping mechanism for something terrible he went through?\n\nWould love to hear how others interpreted it.",

Idk if I've watched those more than Shark Boy and Lava Girl, though. I loved that movie as a kid and saw it so many times. My poor mother let me watch that movie three times in theaters.  She had to sit through it every time. Then it became one of those movies that you just see on TV and start watching again. Then I would rewatch it as an adult as just an amazing bad movie to laugh at. All in all, I've certainly seen it more than a dozen times. There were also all the movies we had on VHS and DVD, like the first Pokemon movie and Over the Hedge that I'm also sure I've seen a dozen times. If I had to guess though, I think Shark Boy and Lava Girl takes the crown, even though it's obviously not my favorite movie of all time today.",

        "title": "Movies that did not have any meaning or impact to you until you got older?",
        "content": "For me it\u2019s the movie Sideways. I think I was in 9th grade when it came out and all the adults around me from family to teachers were talking about how awesome it was. I watched it one night after my parents rented it and I was like \u201cMan this is boring, no tits or explosions and the jokes aren\u2019t funny\u201d\n\nBut now I am 35 and divorced. I been through phases of depression and self doubt and crawled out of metaphorical dark pits to become happy and adjusted. I am coincidentally a teacher like the protagonist, and have done a lot of traveling with buddies and seen all my friends and family go through the adulting experience. I have my niche hobbies that I enjoy and seek out for simple pleasures in life. I\u2019ve had deep conversations with myself about why I\u2019m doing certain things, and pondering on the significance of big steps I have taken.\n\nBecause of all that, I think the movie is great. \n\nIt\u2019s just the type of movie you can\u2019t really appreciate or truly get until you have some of those big life experiences under your belt. As a young person it\u2019s hard to relate to, but as an adult it sometimes hits you in the stomach with how relatable it can be either through the four protagonist or just the fact sometimes tough experiences life throws at you. \n\nWhat are some movie for y\u2019all that just didn\u2019t click for you until you got older? \n\nAlso as a bonus for me basically all the Coen brother\u2019s movies. As a young person I couldn\u2019t stay awake for them, now I find them side splittingly funny and very enjoyable. As well as the TV show King of The Hill. I am from Texas so it was always kind of funny in an inside joke kind of way, but when you yourself are trying to be King of The Hill it\u2019s so much funnier.",

I remember working and going to school all week and then tried to watch Monty Python\u2019s Holy Grail and not finding it even a little funny as I struggled to stay awake. Turns out that was more to do with sleep deprivation, and it truly is a masterpiece in comedy. \n\nI also found Boyhood tedious and ostentatious, but ten years after it came out, I\u2019ve seen the injustices of men allowed to fail upwards as shitty fathers, and women needing to make moral bargains just to care for their children, but understand it\u2019s not always a choice. Boyhood really captured that through Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette\u2019s empathetic portrayals. \n\nLastly, I liked Hereditary on first viewing. It was so well acted and sad af, but it didn\u2019t scare me. (I\u2019d just gone through a traumatic event, so that might have made me numb in that regard). But Then I watched it with surround sound\u2026 in the middle of the night\u2026 in a secluded cabin\u2026 pretty high\u2026 and DAMN. I also watched the Shining in similar conditions with a similar effect. \n\nHow about yall? ",

Not a single frame is wasted.\n\nIt's quite remarkable how this movie is going this way till interval, and then going back post interval and packs so much story in between its never ending action. \n\nHardy &amp; Theron nail their part but Nicholas Hoult character win the movie for me. \n\nBefore this movie, I never expected a movie to be all action. You expect movies to set a plot, to set up characters, to set up story, MMFR does everything without slowing down, and that's art for me.\n\nIt's like a video game where you follow the main character. It's like a heavy metal song you love. It's like the best TV series payoff you wait to happen for years. It's legit perfect. \n\nFrom the ridiculous guitarist belting riffs Iron Maiden would be proud of to the pole swinging assassins, it's just a feast for all senses. \n\nAnd, dare I say, if you little high, there not exists a better adrenaline inducing movie.\n\nCheers.

        "content": "X-Men: Origins had a different director than James Mangold granted, but hotdog water level writing and questionable FX made it borderline unwatchable. Then Mangold takes the reigns in The Wolverine, which while an improvement also suffers from a generic to downright bad third act that feels slapdash and rushed compared to the rest of the film (the director\u2019s cut helps this somewhat). Then we get Logan, which IMO, is the best genre film aside from The Dark Knight (and Nolan\u2019s trilogy had its own stumble with the enjoyable but flawed Rises). \n\nIs there any other trilogy that was so miles ahead of the first film? Or is Logan the only exception to this rule? \n\nEdit: I should preface, as rightly pointed out (thank you folks) that the trilogy could be defined loosely in this sense \u2014 but these were the three stand alone outings as Jackman\u2019s Wolverine so, to that end, that was my metric for defining them as such and also because they do acknowledge events from the film. I believe they even tried to get Lieve back as Sabretooth and modeled X-24 after his look from Origins. So to that end, I don\u2019t discount it. ",
