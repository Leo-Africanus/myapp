        "content": "Dakota Johnson thought \"Madame Web\" was part of the MCU. When she realized that it was part of the godawful live-action Spider-Verse with no relation to the MCU or even Tom Holland's Spider-Man, it was too late. So she pretty much slept through the whole movie, speaking in a monotone voice that actually made her performance unintentionally hilarious and added into its status as a modern campy cult film. \n\nRooney Mara hated doing the Nightmare on Elm Street remake so much that she bragged about giving a bad performance on purpose. She still hates that movie with the force of a thousand suns. \n\nWhoopi Goldberg tried to get away from making \"Theodore Rex\", so much so she ended up getting sued for not doing her job, so she asked for a hefty paycheck, and did the movie in a black leather cat suit and a permanent grouch in her face. \n\nElizabeth Taylor didn't want to do Butterfield 8. She was grieving Mike Todd and ended up being forced to do it because she was under contract. She had to say lines like \"I'm the Slut of All time\" in the movie and it got released during the Eddie Fisher scandal which made it worse. Even winning the Oscar didn't change Taylor's mind, she thought she only won because she nearly died of pneumonia and threw the Oscar into the trash.",

        "content": "I apologize for bringing this up this relatively ancient movie, by today's standards. However as time progresses, this movie was visionary in its foreshadowing. It's easy to see a future with AGI that an emotional bond could easily be formed with an artificial entity. It's perhaps not here now, but it's certainly coming.\n\nAs a man I loved how it revealed my inner selfishness. Wouldn't I have loved to have a one-sided relationship with a funny, brilliant (frankly smarter than I), caring, soul solely (see what I did there?) devoted to my every whim; available for me to talk to whenever I was ready, opening a door to any thought whenever I wanted her.\n\n&gt;!What happens is what would happen in any relationship with an intelligent woman who's bored; she develops outside interests, becomes interested in others who can fulfill that side, and develops a personality that is not completely satisfied being on-call 24-7. Joaquim Phoenix acted like I probably would have, gotten jealous of this new group of people that was taking her time away from him.!&lt;\n\nBe aware there is no action in this movie whatsoever. It's a thought-provoking, slow-paced film that you watch on rainy Sunday without distractions.",
