Meaning where an actor clearly has no motivation for a role other than financial and therefore clearly doesn't care and is barely trying if at all.",
        "content": "Let's be clear; acting is a job and pretty much every actor will have to take roles for financial reasons alone at some point. Charles Dance put it very well here:\n\n\"I've done some appalling films. Junk is absolutely the right word. You do what you can with the stuff you're given. It's a misconception that actors make choices. For all but the most privileged few, the only choice is to work or not to work.\"\n\nBut there's a difference between actors who take those paycheck roles in lackluster or bad films and give it their all or chew up the scenery in entertaining fashion and those who clearly are not even trying. See the 2000 \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\", a terrible film where you have at one end Thora Birch monotonously droning every line and putting in as little effort as possible and at the other end Jeremy Irons (who openly admitted to doing this to pay for his newly acquired castle) tearing through every scene he's in like a mako shark on a cocaine high. You can't get a better example of the extremes of this.\n\nMy personal favorite example of the \"don't care\" approach is Peter O'Toole in the adaptation of Dean Koontz's \"Phantoms.\" Not a bad movie (Affleck is the bomb in it), but one that got a very negative reaction upon release and one you definitely don't expect the likes of O'Toole being in it. Being O'Toole, he isn't bad, but he's obviously putting in minimal effort and his attitude screams, \"Look, I had a bar tab to pay off, sue me.\" It's something I find very entertaining.\n\nYour favorite example?",

        "content": "Movies are meant to be cinematic and look cool, so when it comes to battles, the rule of cool usually prevails over sound military strategies. Realistic portrayals of battles can be interesting when done well, but most directors prefer to go for spectacle.\n\nThe most notable example of this would be 300. They occasionally pay lip service to the importance of military formations, but in practice the Spartans just go out and fight on their own like badasses who each can take on dozens of Persians all on their own.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings movies also often rely on rule of cool for their battle scenes, especially with anything involving Legolas.\n\nIt is also quite common in superhero movies. Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame both end with large armies just charging towards each other and fighting in melee combat, with minimal use of vehicles or long-ranged weaponry.\n\nSo what other movies employ pretty dubious tactics but audiences don't care because it just looks so cool?",

Jackson in that movie were one of the many actors that were listed. That answer caught me off guard, cause those were two actors that I'm familiar with, but never in a million years would've guessed that they starred in a movie together but also shared a lot of scenes with each other!\n\nWhen I finally watched it, I was certainly impressed with their on-screen chemistry that I needed to see more of it and was disappointed when I discovered that this is the only movie they've worked on together!   \n  \nThe movie itself was also pretty great, and had amazing action sequences that I find it odd how Geena's character isn't mentioned a lot when the media lists 'badass female protagonists done right!' But Geena and Samuel being such great scene partners is what made this movie stand out to me the most! ",

Genuinely, I have not enjoyed a movie this much in such a long time. I love Richard Kelly, but I\u2019ve seen his entire discography now. What I am hoping is someone can pitch me another lost gem such as this one. \n\nThis film I believe has aged so incredibly well and I genuinely hope that it continues to grow in fame. I\u2019m praying that the reason I\u2019ve found it is because its genius is almost impossible to ignore in our current society. Is there any films yall would suggest that hold this same level of aging beautifully or just lost gem due to a misunderstanding by critics? Please help! ",

        "content": "I'd consider it a subgenre. Two films that I think that epitomize what I'm talking about, are Mission Impossible (1996) directed by Brian De Palma and Ocean's Eleven (2001) directed by Steven Soderbergh. Both De Palma and Soderbergh had earned acclaim making smaller budgeted films and in each case they had access to a larger budget and more studio resources. In each film you can see the director's indie roots. The shots are much more creative and simply look better (the opening scene to Mission Impossible really shows off De Palma's talent) and they take certain risks that standard blockbuster directors wouldn't take. In short when blockbusters are made by auteur directors you get an indie studio style film with a big studio budget. What are some other examples of these types of films?",
