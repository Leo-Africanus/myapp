        "title": "'Five Nights at Freddy's 2' Review Thread",
        "content": "[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/five_nights_at_freddys_2): 10% (19 reviews)\n\n[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/five-nights-at-freddys-2/): 20/100 (4 critics) \n\nAs with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** Beware, some contain spoilers.\n\n&gt; In 2021, two years before the movie version of \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d came out, there was a jokey indie horror movie called \u201cWilly\u2019s Wonderland\u201d that was a total knockoff of the \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d concept. It starred Nicolas Cage as a drifter who gets stranded in a small town, where he\u2019s forced to spend from dusk till dawn cleaning the title emporium. The animatronic mascot attacks in that movie were genuinely violent (and 10 times as inventive as the ones in the \u201cFreddy\u2019s\u201d films), and Cage, who literally didn\u2019t speak a word of dialogue in the entire movie, had so much aura that he turned the act of cleaning into something hypnotically satisfying. \u201cWilly\u2019s Wonderland\u201d made a total of $450,000 at the box office, but it was nifty and riveting horror camp. \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2,\u201d which will likely make $60 million this week, is slapdash product that never quite figures out what it\u2019s doing. It operates according to one rule: The gamers must be served.\n\n-[Owen Gleiberman, Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/five-nights-at-freddys-2-review-josh-hutcherson-1236599283/)\n\n&gt; \u201cWhat idiot designed this?\u201d Mike asks himself, the film pausing for its audience to knowingly chuckle. \u201cThis dumb thing is from the game, Mike,\u201d they all are supposed to think in unison. \u201cIt\u2019s dumb in a way we recognize and therefore enjoy.\u201d Five Nights At Freddy\u2019s 2 spends so much time on set-ups like these that a majority of its 104 minutes seem to be those pauses. In fact, its entire third act is just expectation for a third movie that hopefully never comes. It is a bare minimum branding experiment, a dumb thing designed to be recognized with the hope that enjoyment will simply follow.\n\n-[Jacob Oller, The A.V. Club](https://www.avclub.com/five-nights-at-freddys-2-review): F\n\n&gt; Those sorts of things don\u2019t seem to interest Cawthon. By all evidence, he is singularly unqualified to write towards human experiences that aren\u2019t marblemouthed attempts at references. He\u2019s protecting a franchise, of which Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2 positions itself as an installment, rather than a real movie. As such, it doesn\u2019t bother with a proper ending \u2013 though the beginning and middle it provides suggest that this may not matter. Its shrug of a quasi-cliffhanger may not matter to its young target audience, either. Some of them, though, along with anyone else not inherently besotted with game iconography and YouTuber cameos, may start to wonder what it would be like to watch a real horror movie \u2013 or just one made with the comforts of baseline hackwork. Like a lot of movies, Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2 has its own souvenir popcorn bucket. This may be the first one where the bucket is more entertaining than the feature.\n\n-[Jesse Hassenger, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/dec/04/five-nights-freddys-halloween-review-game-horror-film): 1/5\n\n&gt; The first film confined the murderous animatronics to the restaurant but in Freddy\u2019s 2 they escape their digital shackles, creating the potential for funny and frightening encounters with everyday people. But Tammi and Cawthon never successfully exploit the scenario, conjuring up only dull horror sequences and uninspired comedic bits. The killer mascots may spring the coop, but this sequel never breaks free of its own conventionality.\n\n-[Tim Grierson, Screen Daily](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/five-nights-at-freddys-2-review-maniacal-mascots-remain-star-attraction-of-dull-horror-sequel/5211622.article)\n\n&gt; Cawthon, who single-handedly penned this stopgap slog, is poisoning his own creation. Tammi's direction is swallowed up by baked-in pacing issues and storytelling logic on the same level as a 2nd grader trying to improvise an explanation for why they didn't bring their homework. But that's exactly what made the games so popular in the first place, because the ludicrous lore allowed for fans to fill in the blanks and build community in the process. \"Five Nights at Freddy's 2\" plays out like a movie written by Reddit fan theories that will only make sense to people who were forged in the discourse mines. \"FNaF 2\" fails to deliver on anything cool promised in the trailer (FazFest is shown for like, 5 minutes max), and well-placed Easter eggs, cameos, and one-liners does not a good movie make.\n\n-[BJ Colangelo, Slash Film](https://www.slashfilm.com/2042991/five-nights-at-freddys-2-review/): 4/10\n\n&gt; Mike and Vanessa battling the Marionette and its minions is pure comedy. One scene in particular is so egregiously silly, you can't help but cackle like a hyena. It is absolutely critical to the film's resolve and somehow comically absurd, and that's definitely not what Tammi and Cawthon intended. Five Nights at Freddy's 2 is meant to be a horror experience, so belly laughs shouldn't have been on the menu. The climax needed a different edit to rectify this major problem that derails the film.\n\n-[Julian Roman, Movie Web](https://movieweb.com/five-nights-at-freddys-2-review/)\n\n&gt; The result? The movie fails to tie up any loose ends surrounding Mike and Vanessa's slightly confusing relationship, the Marionette's revenge, and new character Michael's purpose, and wastes otherwise exciting characters such as Matthew Lillard's Afton, Skeet Ulrich's Henry Emily, and McKenna Grace's paranormal investigator Lisa. This could all be put down to Blumhouse wanting to leave as many doors open as possible to keep fans on their toes for further Five Nights at Freddy's movies. However, it's hard not to feel shortchanged, as though we have waited two years for a Five Nights at Freddy's 1.5.\n\n-[Megan Garside, Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/horror-movies/five-nights-at-freddys-2-review/): 2.5/5\n\n&gt; Despite the odd flash of gore (this is a \u201815\u2019 certificate, so expect minimal scares), the film\u2019s biggest crime is that it\u2019s utterly boring. More uninspiring than a supermarket Margherita pizza, it\u2019s one of the poorest movies of 2025.\n\n-[James Mottram, NME](https://www.nme.com/reviews/film-reviews/five-nights-at-freddys-2-review-josh-hutcherson-matthew-lillard-3915960): 1/5\n\n&gt; It\u2019s an incoherent mess, something that, back in the day, would be straight to DVD. \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d has an after-school special vibe with no real horror and no real awareness that it should. \u201cWhat kind of kid would want to come here?\u201d asks Mike. Indeed.\n\n-[Mark Kennedy, Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/five-nights-at-freddys-2-movie-review-19c0cb318d6049c518f51c7f7ff4a330): 0/4\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**PLOT**\n\nOne year has passed since the supernatural nightmare at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. The stories about what transpired there have been twisted into a campy local legend, inspiring the town's first ever Fazfest. Former security guard Mike and police officer Vanessa have kept the truth from Mike's 11-year-old sister, Abby, concerning the fate of her animatronic friends. But when Abby sneaks out to reconnect with Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, it will set into motion a terrifying series of events, revealing dark secrets about the true origin of Freddy's, and unleashing a long-forgotten horror hidden away for decades.\n\n**DIRECTOR** \n\nEmma Tammi\n\n**WRITER**\n\nScott Cawthon\n\n**CINEMATOGRAPHY**\n\nLyn Moncrief\n\n**EDITORS**\n\nTimothy Alverson &amp; Derek Larsen\n\n**RELEASE DATE** \n\nDecember 5, 2025\n\n**RUNTIME**\n\n104 minutes\n\n**BUDGET**\n\n$36 million\n\n**STARRING**\n\n- Josh Hutcherson as Mike Schmidt\n\n- Elizabeth Lail as Vanessa Shelly\n\n- Piper Rubio as Abby Schmidt\n\n- Matthew Lillard as William Afton\n\n- Theodus Crane as Jeremiah\n\n- Skeet Ulrich as Henry\n\n- Mckenna Grace as Lisa\n\n- Teo Briones as Alex\n\n- Kellen Goff as Toy Freddy\n\n- Megan Fox as Toy Chica\n\n- Matthew \"MatPat\" Patrick as Toy Bonnie",

        "content": "During Halloween, my partner and I watched a few themed movies, something we do every year. Besides being spooky, they actually had good plots and were really entertaining. But when Christmas comes around, I feel like there aren\u2019t many movies that truly stand out, it's mostly the same romantic stuff over and over. I know that\u2019s part of the holiday vibe, but I\u2019m wondering if there are any Christmas movies with a genuinely good storyline. Do you know any?\n",

        "content": "I saw in the news today that Tarantino said *There Will Be Blood* isn\u2019t his favorite film of the 21st century because *\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a 2-hander, but Dano is weak sauce, man\u2026 He\u2019s just such a weak, weak, uninteresting guy. The weakest fucking actor in SAG.\u201d*\n\nHonestly, I thought this was an incredibly classless thing for Tarantino to say. First of all, I actually thought Dano was great in the film  he genuinely made me *hate* the character, and when an actor manages that, it usually means they\u2019re doing a damn good job. And from what I\u2019ve read, Dano barely had any time to prepare for the role anyway.\n\nTarantino was one of my favorite directors from the 90s  *Pulp Fiction* is in my top 25 movies ever  but the truth is, as an actor he\u2019s pretty weak himself. Whenever he shows up on screen, he sticks out in all the wrong ways. Even in *Django*, every line he delivers feels forced and unnatural.\n\nToday I lost a lot of respect for Tarantino.",
