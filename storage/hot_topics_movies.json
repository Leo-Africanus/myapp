        "title": "Rewatching Josey Wales is making me realize how intense the pro confederacy and anti Union rhetoric is in the movie",
        "content": "Didn\u2019t realize how blunt and aggressive it is in how it portrays the union as bad and the confederates as good. It\u2019s not grey about it at all lol it\u2019s very black and white.\n\nThe union soldiers are shown to be callous, cold, immoral, dishonest, and conniving. \n\nThe confederate soldiers are shown to be noble, moral, straight-shooting, and possessing of humanity and passion.\n\nI understand that the movie is not portraying the entirety of the two sides, but rather the Jayhawkers and the Bushwhackers. The Bushwhackers did horrible things during the conflict and I\u2019ve seen people online say that that provides the grayness to the portrayal of the two sides but the movie doesn\u2019t really show it that way lol. If you only go by the movie, you wouldn\u2019t think too badly of the Bushwhackers side at all. \n\nAs I understand it, Clint is a libertarian so being pro-states rights and anti-big federal government does line up. Plus, when you take into account how the book was written by a KKK member, it also comes together.\n\nFurthermore, while googling about all this stuff, I just found out that, according to Wikipedia at least, Clint Eastwood is a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, which is described as \u201can American neo-Confederate nonprofit organization of male descendants of Confederate soldiers that commemorates these ancestors, funds and dedicates monuments to them, and promotes the pseudohistorical Lost Cause ideology and corresponding white supremacy.\u201d\n\nSo that might also explain his sympathetic portrayal of that side.\n\nI def am one to appreciate a nuanced or grey portrayal of war times. Obv in conflicts, not all the \u201cgood guys\u201d are morally pure and not all the \u201cbad guys\u201d are evil for evil\u2019s sake. I can appreciate when good guys are shown to be less than perfect and when bad guys are bad for a reason or have nuggets of humanity in otherwise immoral crusades.\n\nBut this movie doesn\u2019t seem to do that, as far as I can grasp. The Union guys are evil, bad, vicious, backstabbing, and violent. The Confederacy are noble rebels that are betrayed when surrendering. The Union are like vindictive rabid dogs coming for the kill while that one young confederate soldier shows his humanity by proclaiming his fear of dying.\n\nObv there\u2019s way more to the film and I\u2019m not covering all that in this post, just this topic specifically. But man, as far as I know, Clint\u2019s character would\u2019ve been part of irl Bill Anderson\u2019s irl massacre where they killed like 160 civilians. Wouldn\u2019t expect that from the way the movie shows things lol.\n\nAnyone else have thoughts on this topic or watch the movie recently enough to have notes on this topic?",

Many in this sub suggested Little Miss Sunshine, and I\u2019m so glad they did.\n\nThe movie follows this messy, dysfunctional family on a chaotic road trip to support Olive, the youngest, in her dream of competing in a beauty pageant. The characters felt so real\u2014flawed but relatable\u2014and the humor struck a perfect balance between dark and heartwarming. Olive\u2019s innocence and determination completely stole my heart.\n\nBy the time the final pageant scene came around, I was laughing through tears. It was such a beautiful reminder that life doesn\u2019t have to be perfect to be meaningful, and even in the chaos, there\u2019s love and hope. Watching it felt like a much-needed hug.\n\n",

The adultery is one thing but later on why were Tonya and Sasha just not mentioned in any capacity. The ending to me is a lot less tragic because I just couldn't skim or get over the fact he doesn't seem too bothered about the child and wife he lost. Yuri is painted as moral, thoughtful and poetic so his carelessness in losing his first son slightly confused me.",

The Rock early on in his career, Rosario Dawson playing an absolute rebel badass, Sean William Scott in his prime, and Christopher Walken chewing up every line he says.\n\nRidiculous, stupid fights. Funny (the scene where they take the narco fruit). And an ending that echoes the great Mask of Zorro final fight sequence. I genuinely hold this up with other 'fun romps' of that era like the Mummy, etc. What a movie!",
