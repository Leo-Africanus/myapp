        "content": "Robert De Niro is, of course, a legendary American actor who\u2019s played a large variety of roles across many decades in the film business.\n\nWhile De Niro has played everything from a Spanish missionary to a WASPy CIA agent, he is often associated with Italian-American characters in movies like The Godfather Part II, The Untouchables, and the Analyze This series. There is a popular image of him as one of the prototypical Italian gangster types of U.S. cinema.\n\nDe Niro has a recognizably Italian name, which adds to this perception. But he is only a quarter Italian-American. Most of his family comes from Northern European countries including Ireland, England, Germany, and the Netherlands.\n\nDe Niro\u2019s famous collaborator Martin Scorsese seems keenly aware of this and has made a point of casting De Niro in roles where his lack of full Italian heritage is built into the plot. In each of Goodfellas, Casino, and The Irishman, De Niro\u2019s character is a notably non-Italian person navigating the Italian mafia environment while surrounded by Italian-Americans who don\u2019t recognize him as one of their own.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m exaggerating this a little bit? Scorsese did cast De Niro as Italians in his early film Mean Streets (alongside fellow non-Italian Harvey Keitel) and in biopic Raging Bull, playing the boxer Jake LaMotta.\n\nBut I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s something I just enjoy about the idea that the someone as extremely knowledgeable about human culture and Italian culture in particular as Scorsese - fully Sicilian, once married to Roberto Rossellini\u2018s daughter, director of a film called Italianamerican - looks at De Niro, commonly stereotyped as a quintessential Italian, and recognizes that he is not that.\n\nScorsese has also cast De Niro in various Anglo, Irish and ethnically miscellaneous roles over the decades. Meanwhile he has never cast Joe Pesci in a role that is not specifically Italian-American.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio, who like De Niro is only a quarter Italian-American but with a recognizably Italian name, has never played an Italian character in a Scorsese movie.",

        "content": "I re-watched The Arrival (2016), and it\u2019s probably the most meaningful movie I\u2019ve ever watched. Now in my late 30s, it sounds cliche, but it hits with a different weight compared to when I first watched it 10 years ago.\n\n*Arrival* is one of the rare science-fiction films that treats intelligence, empathy, and restraint as its true spectacles. Beneath its fucking amazing and moody visuals and measured pacing lies a meditation on language as a technology, one capable of reshaping not just communication but cognition itself. Villeneuve avoids the genre\u2019s usual obsession with conquest or catastrophe, grounding the encounter instead in linguistics, uncertainty, love, and grief.\n\nThat idea mirrors real life as you age. By this point, you\u2019ve learned that understanding does not come without cost. The film\u2019s most unsettling truth is not that the visitors are unknowable, but that truly understanding them permanently alters how time, choice, and loss are experienced. At this point in life, you recognise these patterns in your own life, relationships, careers, and love. You see how earlier decisions quietly encoded both joy and pain, and how awareness doesn\u2019t free you from consequence, it deepens it.\n\nIn that sense, *Arrival* is less about extraterrestrials than about maturity. It asks whether knowledge, love, and connection are still worth pursuing when you can already foresee their endings. The film\u2019s answer feels profoundly adult: meaning isn\u2019t found in avoiding loss, but in choosing fully, consciously, even when the outcome is known.",

What I enjoy most is strong chemistry, meaningful moments, and a love story that actually sticks with you after the movie ends.\n\nI\u2019m mostly interested in more modern romance movies rather than very old or classic films. I don\u2019t mind if the movie is dramatic or even a little heartbreaking, as long as the romance feels genuine and well written. Movies where the relationship feels real, intense, or complicated usually stand out to me more than light or overly cheesy romances.\n\nI\u2019m open to different styles of romance \u2014 slow burns, emotional love stories, realistic relationships, or even romances mixed with other genres like drama or thriller \u2014 but the love story should still be a big part of the movie. I also appreciate good acting and dialogue that makes the emotions feel believable.\n\nIn your opinion, what is the best romantic movie of all time that isn\u2019t too old? If you also like The Notebook, what other movies gave you a similar emotional experience? I\u2019d love to know your recommendations and why those movies stood out to you.",

        "content": "&gt;For Sheriff Ulysses (Bob Odenkirk), his provisional posting to the quaint Midwestern American town of Normal was meant to be a welcome respite from both his marital woes and recent moral injuries in the line of duty. But when a botched bank robbery interrupts the municipality\u2019s tranquil pace, a sordid secret is inadvertently exposed and Ulysses learns that the town is anything but its namesake. Suddenly everyone is trying to shoot the sheriff, even his own deputies, and our put-upon policeman must rely on his affable mettle and some motley crooks if he is to survive the night. (And that's all before the Yakuza show up).",

Later, after feeling stuck and disconnected myself, the silence and distance in the film made sense.\n\nManchester by the Sea felt like nonstop sadness the first time. Watching it later, I understood it was really about living with grief, not fixing it.\n\nThese films taught me that timing matters as much as taste.\n\nWhich movie did you watch at the wrong time, only to understand it better later?\n\nThank you.",

It's one of my favorite movies of all time, not just Christmas movies.\n\n\nExcellent cast, including Norm Macdonald playing a lovably irascible skiff captain and JK Simmons as the big red man himself. Will Sasso and Joan Cusack as the heads of rival families locked in a multi-generational war. Jason Schwartzman as a postman sent to get an icy hellscape ready for postal service (against his will), and Rashida Jones as the local school teacher who catches his eye.\n\nThe movie has a wry sense of humor that never becomes cynical and, in fact, is a sort of cure for cynicism: it shows what it looks like to overcome cynicism and find hope, or connection.\n\n\nWatch it if you haven't; rewatch it if you have. This one's a keeper, y'all.",

        "content": "Disclaimer: I am 100% biased as this is in my top 3 favorite movies of all time but good lord the sheer craftsmanship of this film gets buried beneath the goofy tone and anime aesthetic way too much. \n\nSeriously, just go watch the first 15 minutes of this movie and tell me it doesn't pack an absurd amount of exposition, emotion, and character building into that time while managing to keep it tense and exciting. The opening race tells you everything you need to know about pretty much every character. \n\nSpeed is the best of the best but loves his older brother so much he'll slow down so as not to beat his record. Trixie loves Speed for who he is, even if who he is is an oddball kid who is so into racing that she's a (very close) number 2 in the loves of his life. Ma Racer is simultaneously scared shitless and entirely in awe by what her sons can accomplish but absolutely, totally loves her family no matter what. Pa Racer is principled, has capital-O Opinions about racing and how to do it \"right\" but still torments himself about how things went down with Rex. Rex WAS the best of the best, but gave it up for... something we don't know yet, and it destroyed him.\n\nIn 15 minutes we know more about 5 characters than most movies manage to tell in their entire runtime - all while a visually stunning and exciting race is going down.\n\nAnd it's not like the movie slows down from there. It's never boring, consistently funny, and the finale race is one of the single best things ever put to film. The Wachowski sisters peaked here. I mean it.\n\nWatch this god damned movie",

        "content": "Over the years I've watched Blade Runner a couple of times, but it never sat right with me. I kind of understood why it is considered a masterpiece, but I also kind of didn't.\n\nI watched it again yesterday, and it finally clicked and I also know why: I watched the theatrical version for the first time. The one with Deckard's voice-overs. I don't remember ever having voice-overs in this movie, so it must be that before I've always watched Ridley Scott's Director's Cut or the Final Cut.\n\nI now understand that what I was missing was context. Blade Runner has always been awing me with its imagery and music, but I also found the dialogues to be on the philosophical rather than the logical side and I didn't understand why certain things were happening as they were. This took me out of the movie pretty early, thus I couldn't really appreciate what I was seeing. Now, with Deckard's voice-overs, I do. And the film finally works for me. And it makes me happy, because I too can now fully appreciate a milestone of filmmaking as much as so many other people do.\n\nEDIT: Based on some comments below, I'd like to add that I'm not claiming the voice-over version of the movie is better than the later cuts. I am just glad to now have the context that is given in the voice-overs. Now that I have this context, I will probably watch the \"purer\" Director's Cut or the Final Cut again in the future. I wouldn't be surprised if I prefer them over the theatrical, too. I just needed to context given in the theatrical to better understand the movie in general.\n\nEDIT #2: This blew up much more than I anticipated. I will try to reply to every reasonable comment, but I can't promise.",
