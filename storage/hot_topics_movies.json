        "content": "Was watching the Spielberg documentary last night and during it they talk about the various directors who took over Hollywood in the 70s (Coppola, Lucas, Scorsese, DePalma and obviously Spielberg among others) they mention that it was like crashing a party. Some people were on their way out, they were on their way in. And I thought, \"who was on their way out?\"\n\nIt makes sense, when one era starts it means another is over, but it would be interesting to think some actors or directors careers ended because they couldn't adapt to the \"New Hollywood\", especially since that era is considered a Golden era of films but to some it was the end. \n\nAt first I thought Audrey Hepburn would be the obvious candidate, she was huge in the 60s but then disappeared almost in the 70s. However, looking at her wiki page, it seems she voluntarily left Hollywood to be with her family, not because she couldn't get work. \n\nJust a random thought.",

        "content": "The Fall Guy is available right now on Netflix, at least here in Sweden, so I watched it yesterday with my SO. We were not looking for it specifically, it was just shown on the home page, and we thought, why not? Our two small kids are asleep, it had been a long day, we were tired, it was late, so an easy-to-follow, action movie seemed like a good idea. When it finished we just looked at each other and we both said the exact same thing: 'it was much better than I had expected'.\n\nI had heard about the movie before, but it just looked like the typical action/comedy movie with two very well known faces to pull people into the cinema, so it didn't catch my attention. And in a way it was indeed an action-filled film with plenty of very funny moments, so even if it were just that it would had already fulfilled its duty. But it's also a love letter to stuntmen and women and their craft and skill, showing a lot of their work in front and behind the cameras in a realistic way (or at least that's what I thought as someone that has nothing to do with the cinema business). The choreographies are superbly done, for example the one at the club, when Ryan Gosling's character is under the influence. It also has some very neat scenes that would be worth of mention even in a more \"serious\" movie (I'm talking specifically about the split-screen specular shot of the phone-call; if you have seen the movie I'm sure you know which one I'm talking about).\n\nSo why don't I hear about it more often than I do? I think that it deserves more mentions than it gets.",

        "content": "I know this is technically just me complaining, but I\u2019m honestly surprised more people aren\u2019t annoyed by this, so here I am, being annoying first.\n\nI paused a movie the other night, not to grab snacks, not to doomscroll, just to sit with a scene for a second because it actually landed, and immediately the screen dimmed, the frame shrank, and suddenly I\u2019m being softly but firmly invited to watch some other show I didn\u2019t ask for. Not after the movie. Not later. Right there, frozen mid-emotion, like the platform couldn\u2019t stand two seconds of silence without monetising it.\n\nThere was a time when pausing a film was neutral. The image stayed. The sound stayed in your head. It was your moment. Now it feels like hitting pause just tells the app, \u201cAh, excellent, the viewer\u2019s attention is momentarily vulnerable.\u201d Cue banners, tiles, previews, and that faint sense that you\u2019re doing something wrong by not continuing to consume at the approved speed.\n\nWhat gets me is how backwards this feels compared to how movies used to be treated. Even TV respected the pause. DVDs didn\u2019t leap out of the frame to sell you another disc the second you stopped playback. Hell, VHS didn\u2019t do anything except remind you that rewinding was a pain. The technology was worse, but the respect for the viewing experience was better.\n\nAt this point, apparently the idea of a static image is intolerable. Amazon Prime is especially bad for this. Pause and suddenly the movie becomes a thumbnail in its own house. Netflix does a quieter version, but it\u2019s still there, hovering, waiting, like it\u2019s disappointed in you for not immediately pressing play. And Apple TV loves to turn a pause into a subtle showcase of \u201cother things you should be watching instead of the thing you deliberately chose.\u201d\n\nThe tone of it all is what really grinds my gears. It\u2019s not \u201ctake your time.\u201d It\u2019s more like:  \n\u201cOh, you paused? Cool cool. Just so you know, this movie isn\u2019t the point. Content is the point. We\u2019ll hold your place, but only while we whisper other options at you.\u201d\n\nI get that this is small. I get that it\u2019s not the end of cinema. I also get that I sound like someone yelling at clouds while holding a remote. But these little design choices add up. They chip away at the idea that a film is something you sit with, rather than something you pass through on the way to the next tile.\n\nI don\u2019t expect them to stop. I know the pause screen is prime real estate now, spiritually if not legally.

        "content": "For me, I love the visuals, the score, the way John Boorman handled the story. It's dark and disturbing like fantasy Horror and I appreciate that eerie, mythgological tone about the legend. \n\nBut it's also episodic and not a lot is thoroughly developed like the reintroduction of Morgana into Arthur's life. She just shows up halfway into the movie without any explanation as to how she and Arthur reconnected. And it takes pretty long for Helen Mirren to show up. Thankfully, Mirren is spectacular, a incestuous manipulative monster whose drive for power and beauty becomes her undoing. Her reparte with Nicol Williamson's Merlin (who's superb as the wizard) worked because both actors hated each other in real life.  I still wish the film hadn't made Morgana so underdeveloped. She comes into the movie too late. And a few of the casting choices were not that good: Nicholas Clay and Cherie Lunghi as Lancelot and Guinevere.",

        "title": "Does Michael Clayton (2007) have hidden supernatural elements? Either way, are there other movies that might do something like this?",
        "content": "*I am Shiva, the god of death. -Arthur*\n\n*So all these people, they all start having these dreams, okay?... Except this is like a whole bunch of people having the same dream. They're all having this dream that they should go to this one place. They don't know why or anything. They just have this feeling that they have to go there. -Henry*\n\n\\---\n\nOn the surface, Michael Clayton seems like a grounded thriller about a fixer and the world of corporate corruption that he operates in. But there's one scene that makes me wonder if there's something more happening below the surface.\n\nThe movie opens with one of the later scenes chronologically. Michael pulls over on a country road, he gets out to approach three horses on a hilltop, and his car explodes in the distance from a car bomb. We later learn that he recognizes these horses from an illustration in a book his son is reading, about this collective dream. It's a book his son begged him earlier to read.\n\nIt's a remarkable coincidence. Almost impossible. And it's the opening scene of the movie. So what is going on here?\n\nI think the answer to this question might be found in Arthur. Arthur is presented as a delusional manic-depressive in the middle of a crisis. But, over and over again, he's shown to be right. He is right about the evil corruption at the center of this case. He's right to take a stand against that corruption. He also seems wrapped up in some sort of spiritual delusions. But what if he is right about those too? What if his revelation isn't just a chemical imbalance, but is instead divinely inspired?\n\nArthur, and later Michael, each refers to himself as Shiva, the god of death. I'm not an expert on Hinduism, but from what I can find, Shiva is the god of restorative destruction, who destroys ignorance and evil to allow for renewal and rebirth. That is exactly what Arthur, and later Michael, are setting out to do. What if they don't mean these words as a metaphor? What if Shiva is literally pulling the strings?\n\nIt's probably tempting here to think I'm taking a metaphor too far. But take the scene where Arthur is assassinated. In it, we learn that there really is a hidden layer of corruption operating under the surface of the world, pulling the strings. People are being assassinated in ways that appear to be accidents. Companies are killing hundreds with their products and sweeping it under the rug. There is an evil force in the world, pulling the strings. It's something most characters cannot see, but we, the audience can, and it's real.\n\nBut what if there is *another* force, operating at an even *deeper* level, who destroys that evil? What if Michael's climb to see the horses only *appears* mundane because, like the assassination, there is a force operating under the surface, so deep this time that even we cannot see? What if the horses saving his life isn't some incredible coincidence, but the real and precise orchestrations of Shiva using Arthur and Michael in his plans to destroy and renew?\n\nWhat do you think? And whether this interpretation is justified or not in this case, are there other examples where a mundane-seeming movie might be hinting at something more under the surface?",

        "content": "For those who don't know, the \"sacrificial lion\" is a trope wherein a good/powerful character is killed to prove to the audience that the villain is a threat or the situation is genuinely dire. I wanted to get more specific though and find the best examples of this trope happening all within one fight - specifically, where the heroes were already struggling together against the villain, placing more emphasis on how screwed the remaining hero is. Two examples (spoilers for Star Wars: Phantom Menace and Mission Impossible: Fallout):\n\n1. [Darth Maul vs. Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo__6MZIg6U) \\- Bolstered by John William's insane soundtrack and some of the best choreography in the series, this might be the best fight in Star Wars. Specifically though, I like how the tone of the fight completely shifts when Qui-Gon dies - Obi-Wan is alone but pissed off, and the audience both fears for him (if the master couldn't do it, what chance does the student have) and roots for him to get revenge.\n2. [Fake John Lark vs. Ethan Hunt and Real John Lark](https://youtu.be/z83IyEgxPrk?si=mlnVYzgvVTRWU8AW&amp;t=210) \\- This whole fight is awesome, but the best moment (besides Henry Cavill reloading his fists) happens near the end, when Fake John Lark grabs Real John Lark by the hair, takes a moment to stare down Ethan Hunt, then knocks him out and readjusts his suit jacket. Ethan has always been shown to be a skilled combatant, so the fact that he couldn't even beat this guy *with* help is pretty intimidating. I love that this random henchman gives our main hero such a challenge, as well as Tom Cruise's \"I really don't want to be doing this\" look right before he charges him. \n\n \n\nWhat's the best example of this trope that you can think of?

        "content": "Can anyone chime in here about the movie Cop Land (1097) with Sylvester Stallone?  This is one of my favorite movies but one part has always irked me and I've never figured it out, nor have I found anywhere online where this plot point was discussed or explained.\n\nEarly in the movie, Sheriff Freddy drops a stuffed animal off and his unrequited love's house (Liz).  She tells him someone is dumping garbage bags.  It's revealed that Rose, the wife of Harvey Keitel's character Ray is the one who does it.  She says something to the effect \"If Joey Randone thinks I got no right, you should tell him to stop soiling my sheets\".   \n\nThis line (and the action it refers to) confuses the hell out of me.  Other evidence in the movie suggests Joey is sleeping with Rose.  But if that were the case, why would Rose dump her trash at Joey's house?  For one, it seems she is afraid of Ray finding out she's cheating, but this action contradicts that from every logical standpoint.  It would make more WAY more sense if the scorned spouse (Ray) dumped the trash.  But his 'mob boss of the cops' persona makes it seem unlikely he would take such petty action against Joey.   The whole bit with Rose would make more sense if Joey and Ray were shacking up, but there doesn't seem to be any other evidence in the movie to support this. Or if Ray and Liz were shacking up, Rose would be the scorned wife and the trash would make sense.  But once again no evidence in the movie supports that.\n\nNow, I remember that Ray fumbles with the key and delays helping Joey, and he later dies.  But still, the trash dumping thing and Rose's words just make the whole situation muddy in my mind. \n\nCan anyone provide some insight?  For the record, I've also seen the Director's Cut of this film and I don't think it explains anything else regarding this.",

        "content": "Can you recall favorite movies that take a light and humorous approach to life and have sad or anxious characters? I recently saw a film about loss but the movie was way too depressing and I did not finish watching it, so got me thinking that it's best to try to find films have a sense of humor as they deal with painful everyday issues like loss that trigger anxiety or anger in people.\n\nLittle Miss Sunshine does it so well. I mean&gt;! it deals with suicide attempt!&lt; for God's sakes, that's how it begins! Not exactly funny. Serious stuff. And the family all got their neuroses and ticks and mistaken assumptions about the world. They can't relate to each other, have their own dreams that are bound to fail, yet share a common humanity that links them in a very deep level. Not just to each other but to us. So while we laugh at them, we also laugh with them because there is a little of bit of that in all of us.\n\nSideways is similarly about these two guys, one of whom, Miles, is a neurotic and depressed and angry writer or writer-wannabe (he's a teacher). The other guy, Jack, is a charmer and just wants to have fun and get laid before he gets married! Perfect BFFs, no? So they go to California's wine country before the marriage ceremonies. Miles is my focus here naturally, as a depressed and angry character, and I think in any other movie, you'd get depressed or pissed watching him or thinking about his failure of a life but in this movie it's pretty funny, even as you see him deal with more disappointments professionally and in his romantic relationships. At the same time, you could also relate to him and sympathize with him, if you ever been in a similar situation, but given the humor, the movie never gets heavy or depressing.\n\nWhat do you think of these movies and their approach to real life problems? Are there other movies that have the same effect on you?",
