Guy's a complete scumbag ffs. Not to mention keeping all the world changing tech secrets to himself lol \n\nAnd i swear this guy isnt just simply \"absent minded\"... Hes such a genius yet cant tell time properly and misses the first wedding, whilst not realizing hes been lecturing a life drawing class for a full 5 minutes, nor that he was at a rehearsal dinner for his own wedding just the night before, is utterly bonkers!! \n\nI mean theres ditzy and scatterbrained, and then theres just full blown dementia! \ud83e\udd26\n\nDear god this has spoiled my memories of this flick BIG TIME! \ud83d\ude1e\n\nDid I miss anything?

        "content": "*MMA fighter Mark Kerr reaches the peak of his career but faces personal hardships.*\n\nCast: Dwayne Johnson, Emily Blunt\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [N/A (updating)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_smashing_machine_2025)\n\n**Metacritic:** [N/A (updating)](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-smashing-machine/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[The Independent - Geoffrey Macnab](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/the-smashing-machine-review-dwayne-johnson-b2817883.html) \\- 4 / 5\n\n&gt;This, though, is a story in which winning finally begins to seem very hollow. The real way Safdie puts a chokehold on his audience is by examining Mark and Dawn\u2019s physical and emotional weaknesses in such forensic detail. The Smashing Machine may not provide the pay-offs that audiences expect from more conventional sports movies, but this is the most raw and vulnerable that Johnson has ever been on screen. Once you\u2019ve seen him this exposed, you won\u2019t watch his typical action movie stunts in quite the same way ever again.\n\n[Daily Telegraph - Robbie Collin](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/the-smashing-machine-review-dwayne-johnson/) \\- 4 / 5\n\n&gt;It\u2019s a classical fight movie that innovates subtly. Maceo Bishop\u2019s nimble photography has the sweat and grit of a vintage muscle flick from the Pumping Iron era, but the score by the experimental jazz composer Nala Sinephro is all swirling harps and breathy saxophones; arguably no piece of music has ever sounded less like a punch in the face. Yet as an accompaniment to Kerr\u2019s battles in and out of the ring, it\u2019s oddly perfect, giving this tough story an unexpectedly sweet and even spiritual edge. Smashing stuff has rarely been such smashing stuff.\n\n[Next Best Picture - Cody Dericks](https://nextbestpicture.com/the-smashing-machine/) \\- 7 / 10\n\n&gt;Dwayne Johnson delivers the best performance of his career as the amiable but troubled UFC champion Mark Kerr. Emily Blunt and Ryan Bader are also excellent in their roles. The screenplay is repetitive and frustrating. Blunt's character is so unlikeable and written with such vitriol that it becomes exhausting to watch her, although Blunt's performance is as good as it could possibly be.\n\n[Variety - Owen Glieberman](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/the-smashing-machine-review-dwayne-johnson-benny-safdie-1236503546/)\n\n&gt;Johnson, shifting his whole aspect (he seems like a new actor), invests that silent, moody, hidden side of Mark with a quality of mystery. He gives an extraordinary performance, playing Mark Kerr as a gentle giant with demons that will not speak their name, yet the audience can feel them there; we want to see those demons healed. You might think the key word in the movie\u2019s title is \u201csmashing,\u201d but it\u2019s actually \u201cmachine.\u201d Mark is a man who reins in his violence by having constructed his entire self \u2014 body and personality \u2014\u00a0as a controlled engine of demolition. The movie is about how this man-machine becomes a human being.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - Jordan Mintzer](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-smashing-machine-review-dwayne-johnson-delivers-the-blows-as-a-tormented-fighter-in-benny-safdies-gritty-and-downbeat-mma-flick-1236358361/)\n\n&gt;Johnson has rarely played a loser, but he\u2019s always been likable, displaying a massive grin to match his massive pecs in action vehicles that never allowed him to showcase much range. He manages to go deep here without overdoing it, killing the audience with kindness as a benign warrior who suffers from one scene to the next, triumphing briefly in the ring before succumbing to addiction and/or romantic grief. Like Mickey Rourke in *The Wrestler* \u2014 a film from which Safdie seems to take a few cues \u2014 the actor delivers an intoxicating mix of blood, sweat, tears, protein and total helplessness.\n\n[IndieWire - Ryan Lattanzio](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/the-smashing-machine-review-1235148509/) \\- 'B+'\n\n&gt;Johnson\u2019s performance is out-and-out wonderful, a beady-eyed fusion of body and spirit that osmoses Safdie\u2019s sensibility to deliver what can\u2019t be disputed as the most layered work of the actor\u2019s career. A vividly contradictory Blunt, funny and sad especially in articulating Dawn\u2019s conflicted response to Mark\u2019s post-rehab emotional about-face during a tense argument, is equally sensational.",

There\u2019s no acknowledging of good things in bad movies (which sometimes isn\u2019t easy to find so sometimes there is just nothing redeeming about it) or criticisms for good movies. It\u2019s always \u201cwell is it a fresh or rotten review?\u201d, \u201cWhat\u2019s the rating?\u201d \u201cSum up your thoughts in a sentence\u201d, \u201cmovie good or movie bad\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m also sick of the \u201cwell you didn\u2019t agree with me on a movie therefore I can\u2019t listen to your opinions about anything\u201d. It\u2019s. Subjective. Someone not reacting the same way as you doesn\u2019t mean their opinion is invalid. \n\nOr the whole \u201cthey just hate fun\u201d argument. Or \u201cwhy can\u2019t you just enjoy it??! It\u2019s not that deep!\u201d I don\u2019t go into every movie thinking I\u2019m going to hate it. I do give the benefit of the doubt. \n\nSure some opinions can be pretentious. Hell - I\u2019ve been in that boat where I question someone\u2019s tastes because they\u2019ll say something isn\u2019t \u201cthat bad\u201d. And I did not handle those conversations well. But now I don\u2019t try to make them think they\u2019re wrong for an opinion. I try to ask what worked for them or what didn\u2019t. Sometimes they\u2019ll give me a boring answer like \u201cI was just entertained\u201d but sometimes they\u2019ll throw a point that I may not agree with but can understand. \n\nThere are people who are genuinely nuanced in their approach to talking about movies. But good grief it\u2019s not what it once was. I don\u2019t want to sound like that old guy by saying that given that I\u2019m in my late 20\u2019s but it has gotten worse in the last decade. ",

Daniel Baldwin was worse somehow, an actually uncomfortable presence- he kept beating a woman that was turning into a vampire, at one moment when he tied her to the bed he stripped her of her clothes for some reason. He came across as someone who never had consensual sex with a woman, worse of all is the two ended together at the end of the movie.\n\nBoth literally ruined any enjoyment i might gotten from this movie.",

        "content": "My wife and I did a bit of a biopic marathon this weekend. We watched Bohemian Rhapsody, Rickelman, Walk the Line, and Straight Outta Compton. Each was released approximately 30-40 years after the singer/band was at their most popular. It got me thinking about which current artists will inevitably have an Oscar-bait biopic in the next 3-4 decades. \n\n I landed on Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, and Eminem. Taylor Swift because she\u2019s Ari ably the biggest pop star right now and doesn\u2019t show any signs of not continuing to dominate music, at least in the eyes of her very loyal fans. And she has had a complex dating history which will make nice story beats in a bio pic. Justin Bieber because he\u2019s had quite the fall after rising very rapidly at a young age and because of his proximity to some nefarious  actors in music\u2019s history. And Eminem because he\u2019s such a polarizing yet popular figure with his own substance abuse and mental health struggles; that Oscar writes itself lol. And I know we had kind of a biopic on him already with Eight Mile, but he\u2019ll inevitably get a proper biopic.\n\nWhat current artists do you see getting a biopic in the next 30-40 years? And why?",
