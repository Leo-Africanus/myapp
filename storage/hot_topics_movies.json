        "content": "*World-renowned detective Benoit Blanc returns for his most dangerous case yet.*\n\nDirector: Rian Johnson\n\nCast: Daniel Craig, Cailee Spaeney, Jeremy Renner, Andrew Scott, Mila Kunis, Thomas Haden Church, Glenn Close, Josh Brolin, Kerry Washington, Josh O'Connor\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [100%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wake_up_dead_man_a_knives_out_mystery)\n\n**Metacritic:** [85/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/wake-up-dead-man-a-knives-out-mystery/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Variety - Owen Glieberman](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/wake-up-dead-man-a-knives-out-mystery-review-daniel-craig-1236510178/)\n\n&gt;Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery is an enticingly clever and droll, nearly pitch-perfect piece of murder-mystery fun \u2014 a whodunit that lives up to the expectations set six years ago by \u201cKnives Out,\u201d which offered its own perfect revival of the Agatha Christie spirit, with a tasty frosting of meta cheekiness.\n\n[TheWrap - Chase Hutchinson](https://www.thewrap.com/wake-up-dead-man-review-rian-johnson-daniel-craig-knives-out-3/)\n\n&gt;Although \u201cWake Up Dead Man\u201d is the \u201cKnives Out\u201d movie that\u2019s most preoccupied with existential questions surrounding death, writer/director Rian Johnson\u2019s third film in the series is also the one that\u2019s most full of life.\n\n[DEADLINE - Damon Wise](https://deadline.com/2025/09/wake-up-dead-man-a-knives-out-mystery-review-rian-johnson-daniel-craig-1236510199/)\n\n&gt;After the bright, light, summery holiday special that was *Glass Onion*, the *Knives Out* franchise returns to its gothic roots with a wintry whodunit that, for some at least, might endure as the the best one yet. Where the first and second used the murder-mystery as a jumping-off point for some very funny contemporary satire, *Wake Up Dead Man* is much more introspective. In a funny way, it\u2019s a little analogous to *Joker 2*, not because it unloads on its audience in the same acerbic way but because it poses similarly metaphysical questions about its own popularity. Why do people respond so eagerly to stories of murder and betrayal? To answer that, director [Rian Johnson](https://deadline.com/tag/rian-johnson/) goes back to the greatest story ever told, using a small religious community as the setting for the third instalment.\n\n[IndieWire - Kate Erbland](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/wake-up-dead-man-review-rian-johnson-third-knives-out-1235149631/) \\- 'B+'\n\n&gt;It works, and it\u2019s no big mystery why \u2014 Johnson knows his form and format, and delivers on it, playing with tone and message but never losing sight of why these stories are so damn entertaining to watch and unravel.\n\n[Awards Radar - Joey Magidson](https://awardsradar.com/2025/09/07/tiff-review-wake-up-dead-man-a-knives-out-mystery-is-rian-johnsons-best-and-most-ambitious-installment-yet/) \\- 3.5 / 4\n\n&gt;Filmmaker Rian Johnson trusts the strength of his franchise to play around with format and theme. The gothic elements on display, as well as the religious aspect, may initially seem like a left turn, but it all ends up fitting like a glove. He knows the must haves for a *Knives Out* flick and absolutely delivers. A few big sequences here at TIFF received ovations once completed. You just can feel that you\u2019re in the hands of a master storyteller, so you\u2019ll follow him anywhere. Johnson knows that and 100% makes the most of it.\n\n[The Daily Beast - Nick Schager](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/wake-up-dead-man-knives-out-3-finds-god-and-is-so-good-because-of-it/)\n\n&gt;In terms of pure, heady kicks, it outpaces *Knives Out* but falls just short of *Glass Onion*. In the big picture, however, such distinctions are rather inconsequential; more important is that Johnson\u2019s franchise remains a sly and sure-footed delight, as well as demonstrates, with its religiously minded latest, that it\u2019s capable of coloring its Christie-esque mysteries in a variety of shades.",

        "content": "Or at least, as close to perfect as a film can get. \n\nIt had been years since I watched Jaws, probably since I was in high school as a freshman, and I just went a few days ago to see it in IMAX for its 50th anniversary. It felt like watching it again for the first time. What I couldn\u2019t believe was how, despite having watched the film countless times as a kid, and remembering everything even after not having seen it in years, it felt like the first time watching it again. The movie magic was there in a way I haven\u2019t felt in a really long time. This was driven home by the fact I really couldn\u2019t find a single flaw with this film. \n\nYes, some minor visual stuff with some shark props, but that\u2019s excusable since it\u2019s a film from 1975 and this was a 4K remaster. Of course there will be at least a few visual things to notice. I don\u2019t count that, because those weren\u2019t mistakes. Simply limitations of the time. The effect for the shark in the water still looks great, and the editing between the animatronic and live shark footage was seamless. The cinematography is still outstanding. Spielberg\u2019s use of long takes has always been my favorite staple of him. \n\nI truly think Jaws is about as close to a perfect film as you can really get. It truly is flawless from a filmmaking perspective, especially considering how troubled the production was, it\u2019s miraculous the movie even exists, let alone with the level of quality it has. Literally every single facet of the filmmaking was dialed to perfection, and Spielberg maintained this with a multitude of films in his career. Just breathtaking to finally see it on the big screen. It was a real treat.",

This is particularly impressive given the most compelling original cast character is barely or arguably not in it at all.\n\nI also find that run of Wrath of Kahn, Search for Spock, and Voyage Home to be among the best three movie runs within a franchise that don't start with the first movie.  \n\nUsually the fist movie of the franchise is good enough to get a franchise going and usually franchises tend to go downhill fast after the third film, so the original cast Star Trek movies are one of the few exceptions as far as I can tell.\n\nI can think of a horror franchise and an action franchise that both apply to this topic.\n\nThoughts?",

        "content": "Back when the movie released in theaters, I watched it in a crowded AMC with a friend and absolutely loved it. I was not familiar with Robinson\u2019s work, but I loved the absurdity and awkwardness. I think my initial reaction was also influenced by the energy of the theater, which was full of cackles and laughs throughout most of the movie. \nI got home and thought \u201cman, my husband would have loved that.\u201d\n\n\nSo 2 months ago I made him watch it with me, thinking he\u2019s for sure going to be laughing the entire time just as me and the whole theater were - and he absolutely hates it. Halfway through he\u2019s like, \u201cdoes it get better?\u201d And I was like \u201cI mean\u2026 No\u2026 but it\u2019s good!\u201d\nBut by that point I was also feeling completely different about this movie too. The experience of watching it in my apartment next to my extremely unsettled husband was of course a big vibe shift, but I admittedly was also more uncomfortable this time around. But I\u2019m thinking \u2018no it\u2019s good I remember laughing so much we HAVE to stick it out.\u2019\nAnyways, it ends, and my husband is just sick of it. Like it emotionally drained him, and ruined his mood. And I felt terrible, and weirdly similar. \n\n\nWhat I had forgotten was that I had messaged my family after my experience watching it in theaters, of course giving it a glowing review lmao\n\nWell now it\u2019s on HBO Max, so my mom tells me she sat my brother and dad down and watched it - and they all had the same reaction as my husband. Just HATED it.\n\n \nMy mom is messaging me through the whole thing going \u201cyour brother couldn\u2019t stand 15 months and went to bed\u201d, \u201cyour dad is taking a break - does it get any better?\u201d, \u201che just licked the toad\u201d, \u201cthis is an extremely weird movie why did you tell us to watch this\u201d, \u201cyour dad is genuinely mad\u201d,\nand finally, my favorite message\n\n\n \u201cThat movie put everyone in a mood \nWe are all moody  now \nI\u2019m going to bed \u201c\n\n\nThe last time a movie got a reaction like this from my family the movie was Hereditary. \nAlthough I feel bad for pissing everyone off, I do find it pretty incredible that a comedy movie could make so many people feel so deeply uncomfortable that it psychologically impacts them to such a degree, and I just needed to share this with someone. What did you think of this movie lol?\n ",

It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve seen it in cinemas or at home. You can name multiple possible ones if you don\u2019t remember a singular one. \n",

Now, I'm on a mission to craft an epic list of the most jaw-droppingly violent films across all genres.\n\nI'm looking for movies that pack a punch in terms of bloodshed, along with their ratings and how much they've raked in at the box office or how many viewers they have. And don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t spoil any thrilling moments\u2014gotta keep the suspense alive! If you have any suggestions, let\u2019s hear them!",
