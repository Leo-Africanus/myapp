        "content": "It might be nostalgia affecting my view. Either way, I always had a soft spot for Willie Scott, because she was a fish out of water and acted accordingly. \n\nCritics sometimes complain about the Mary Sue or the leading lady who turns into GI Jane in just 15 minutes, yet with Willie Scott, the spoiled Cabaret singer who's taken \"hostage\" by Indiana Jones and finds herself falling off planes and made as a sacrifice for a Satanic God, she never changes. She screams, she has temper tantrums, she cries and she is grossed out by the food. \n\nI liked her for it, because it's how most humans would have acted in her place, and I enjoyed Kate Capshaw's attempts at bringing screwball humor as well as showing Willie having a bit of a evolution along the way. \n\nShe's not the smart and adventurous Marion Ravenwood, she's not expected to be. Every romantic interest Indiana Jones had in the original trilogy was different. Willie was, easily, the one leading lady who had the meatiest role since she's onscreen for most of the film. \n\nCan I also say the \"Anything Goes\" number in Cantonese opening number slays the house boots down? You could tell Steven Spielberg could direct a musical if he wanted in 1984.",

        "content": "I think it's fair to say Sunshine is a visually gorgeous film and the soundtrack is beautiful as well. The story itself can be interpreted in multiple ways which makes it more interesting.\n\nThe writer of the film, Alex Garland said he \"wrote Sunshine as a film about *atheism*.\"\n\nHe expanded on the subject on the introduction of the *Sunshine* *screenplay*.\n\n\"A crew is en route to a God-like entity: the Sun. The Sun is larger and more powerful than we can imagine. The Sun gave us life, and can take it away.\n\n\"As the crew travel nearer to the Sun, the majesty of the burning star fries their minds. The crew are hypnotized by it, or baffled by it, or driven mad by it. Ultimately, even the most rational crew member is overwhelmed by his sense of wonder and, as he falls into the star, he believes he is touching the face of *God*.\n\n\"The Sun is *God-like*, but not *God*. Not a conscious being. Not a divine architect. And the crew member is only doing what man has always done: making an awestruck category error when confronted with our small place within the vast and neutral scheme of things.\"\n\nThe director, Danny Boyle, had a different approach.\n\n\"The director, Danny Boyle, who is not atheistic in the way that I am, felt differently. He believed that the crew actually were meeting *God*.\n\n\" I didn't see this as a major problem, because the difference in our approach wasn't in conflict with the way in which the story would be told. The two interpretation that could be made from the narrative were the same two interpretations that could be made from the world around us.\"\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this subject?",

It seems to be a sub sub-genre of Neo-Noir. The prerequisites for a film being a labeled within the genre are it taking place in LA (mandatory),  and at least two of the following: an uncovered conspiracy, the discovery of a clandestine cult, a missing person/murder, the involvement of the film-making industry, and (the most difficult to articulate of them all) the sense that protagonist is stumbling through a series of chaotic underworlds with internal ongoings/plots of their own that predate the story of the movie and will continue on after its end. These aren't strict rules, but they seem to cover the majority of what I'm looking for.\n\nHere's what I have so far...\n\n***Films that definitely fit:***\n\n1. Chinatown\n2. Mulholland Drive\n3. The Big Lebowski\n4. Under the Silver Lake\n5. Inherent Vice\n6. The Nice Guys\n7. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\n8. Maxxxine\n\n(for me 3-5 exemplify exactly what I'm looking for the most, as they really have that ineffable quality of befuddled main characters tripping into bizarre worlds they can barely make sense of)\n\nSo what do you guys think? Am I missing any?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \nI'll keep updating the post as suggestions roll in and create a superlist after a day or so, so people searching for hollyweird movie suggestions in the future to find.\n\n***Films suggested by you all that I have seen but had forgotten fit the subgenre:***\n\n1. Seven Psychopaths\n2. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\n3. Hail, Ceasar!\n4. Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\n\n***Films suggested by you all (that I have not seen) so far and seem to fit the subgenre:***\n\n1. Sunset Boulevard (most popular suggestion by an overwhelming majority)\n2. Night Moves\n3. The Long Goodbye\n4. The Big Sleep\n5. Beyond the Valley of the Dolls\n6. Repo Man\n7. Harper\n8. Day of the Locust\n9. Whatever happened to Baby Jane?\n10. Body Double\n11. Lost Highway\n12. LA Confidential\n13. Dragnet (1987)\n14. Harper \n15. Day of the Locust\n16. Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?\n17. Body Double\n18. Babylon\n19. Miracle Mile\n20. Get Shorty\n21. The Player\n22. Hardcore\n23. Neon Demon\n24. The Substance\n\n***Films suggested by you all so far that are probably great, but don't fit the subgenre:***\n\n1. The Usual Suspects (feels too far removed from Hollywood, a lack of cult/weird underworld)\n2. Training Day (feels too far removed from Hollywood, a lack of cult/weird underworld)\n3. Inland Empire (Not LA, unfortunately)\n4. Nightcrawler (no mystery, conspiracy that I can remember)\n5. Buckaroo Bonzai (its close, like the Blade Runner films but doesn't quite hit the hollywood/conspiracy part enough and the setting isn't ostensibly real)\n6. Big Trouble in Little China (I mean... great film, but it takes place in San Francisco! lol)\n\nI see others in the comments I don't recognize but I don't have the time to do cursory research on all of them to make a call on where to categorize them. I hope to get to the rest later tonight. Also, if you disagree with how I've categorized some of these, let me know in the comments, and try to convince me to change my mind! I'm making judgment calls on films I haven't watched, so I'm open to hearing opposing arguments.",

        "content": "Just rewatching 'The Man from U.N.C.L.E' again - I know it's an 'underrated gem' in this sub - but one moment that always stuck with me was when the heads of CIA and KGB said their goodbyes after making Solo and Kuryakin team up, and when they shook hands, Adrian (Jared Harris) says \"give my regards to Nina\". It's that ole 'on opposing sides but still respectful' notion. And with just one sentence, you get a whole sense of their relationship and history.\n\nWhat small moments in other films have stuck with you?\n\n(Also, still tickles me every time I watch it that two Brits are playing Americans, while the American plays a Russian).",
