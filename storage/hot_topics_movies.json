        "content": "This is something I have noticed. The thing with Tyler is he started off as a play writer and never really got out of it. He is a play writer first and the movies are basically a lot of his plays put in movies at random. \n\nI don\u2019t understand how he owns the bigger studio, so big people can live there not just him. Yet, still look cheap. \n\nMy theory is, from what I have seen, all the buildings on base are also used for set designs. All the building designs are similar so it doesn\u2019t look like a town. It just looks like a filming base. \n\nMaybe that\u2019s not the reason but he does have a lot of money and I just wonder how he unintentionally makes his movies look cheap. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not hating on cheap films. There are so many low budget and cheaply made films that I enjoy watching. A film being cheap doesn\u2019t always make the film bad.",

        "content": "Every now and then people talk about gnarly scenes that kind of come out of nowhere (like that one near the end of Bone Tomahawk) but what about scenes from movies that are already violent, but stand out anyway? For example, there's a brief bit in the Michael Bay movie 13 Hours where three dudes in a street get absolutely dismantled by a machine gun firing from the back of a pickup truck. It's quick, only about one second, but it stuck with me for a long time after watching the movie. Something about seeing those guys just fall apart has never really left my mind, even though the whole movie is pretty violent and has plenty of other gut-wrenching scenes. Another one that seems to be permanently implanted in my mind is in Saving Private Ryan, when they are storming the beach and a guy gets his entire face blown away. All that's left is a concave hole. Even in a movie as violent as SPR, that one brief bit has always stuck with me.\n\n\nI mean, I've seen lots of violent movies (including all the Saw films) but somehow there's scenes like this that really hit hard and I'm not sure why. Wondering if anyone else has anything similar.",

        "content": "I watched Gangs of New York tonight. I hadn\u2019t seen this movie since it first came out in the theater 20+ years ago. Aside from a few stunning visual images, I didn\u2019t remember anything about it.\n\nHoly hell, is this movie riveting. It really strikes me as a spiritual counterpart to the Departed. The tension the story builds about an imposter or infiltrator trying not to be discovered keeps you glued to the screen.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio seems to thrive in that role - the infiltrator. Theres something about the  intensity of his eyes and face while taking orders - he listens intently while his body seems to be aching to lunge forward and attack.\n\nDaniel Day Lewis of course is Daniel Day Lewis. Bill the Butcher is one of the great bad guys in cinema. He portrays that character so well that he humanizes the nativist backlash and gives us tremendous empathy. But we also agree he needs to die.\n\nWe\u2019ve all heard stories about DDL being very method, getting himself in a character and refusing to break it on set or during the duration of filming, often treating costars and crew members badly in the process. I normally think this kind of process is a bit excessive, but Bill the Butcher makes me think that sometimes, the ends justify the means and that a piece of art so enduring may warrant some temporary suffering.\n\nOne of his killings (and you\u2019ll know it when you see it) gave me one of most audible gasps that I\u2019ve ever had watching something. Maybe season 2 episode 1 of House of Cards came close).\n\nThe production design is incredible. As a history lover, seeing a pre-automobile major city brought to life is magical. I wish I could step into it and walk among the filthy streets.\n\nIf you have never seen this film, or, like me - haven\u2019t seen it in years. Check it out. I\u2019m interested i hearing what others think.",

        "content": "Not sure if anyone noticed it before but I haven't seen anyone speak about this yet, but that guy we see staring at Sue when she's asked to go into Harvey's office in a moment of vulnerability as she wasn't able to change...It's Vincent Colombe, casted as the \"Guy in Suit #2\". \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/xTAZ2ky](https://imgur.com/a/xTAZ2ky)\n\nThe same guy who also played in Coralie Fargeat's previous movie, Revenge (2017). In that movie, Vincent is responsible of Jennifer's rape, a most gruesome scene, really.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/gRlaR7R](https://imgur.com/a/gRlaR7R) \n\nI found this detail to be so morbid that I had to share it... I mean, the guy who sexually assaulted Jennifer (sharing very similar traits with Sue) being in the same temporality as Sue just sent chills down my spine, precisely because no one could actually think that he could be capable of doing such a thing, he appears for like 3 seconds in The Substance and we never see him again, he who was such a menace in Revenge ! That's just crazy.  ",

        "content": "Hello there!\n\nSince more than 40 days, I ask you for your favorite movie set in a given european country once a day. Yesterday, we took a look at Slovakia, and even though I haven't seen the winning movie yet - as is so often the case here - I'm pretty sure it will be a worthy entry on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/): ***Obchod na Korze*** (engl.: *The Shop on Main Street*) has not only made it here, but also won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1965.\n\nWill we have such a high-ranking visitor in the next round, too? Well, we'll see. Our next country is no longer Slovakia, but **Slovenia**, and as everytime before, there are only two rules in this game:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\n\n\n&gt;Day 42: Slovakia - Obchod na Korze (engl.: The Shop on Main Street)\n\n&gt;Day 41: Serbia - Balkanski \u0161pijun (engl.: Balkan Spy)\n\n&gt;Day 40: San Marino - Lo Sconosciuto di San Marino (engl.: Unknown Men of San Marino)\n\n&gt;Day 39: Russia - \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0435\u0440 (engl.: Stalker)\n\n&gt;Day 38: Romania - 4 luni, 3 s\u0103pt\u0103m\u00e2ni \u0219i 2 zile (engl.: 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days)\n\n&gt;Day 37: Portugal - Capit\u00e3o Falc\u00e3o (engl.: The Portuguese Falcon)\n\n&gt;Day 36: Poland - Kr\u00f3tki film o zabijaniu (engl.: A Short Film About Killing)\n\n&gt;Day 35: Norway - Fl\u00e5klypa Grand Prix (engl.: Pinchcliffe Grand Prix)\n\n&gt;Day 34: North Macedonia - \u041d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u0431\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0448 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430 (engl.: You Won\u2019t Be Alone)\n\n&gt;Day 33: Netherlands - Zwartboek (engl.: Black Book)\n\n&gt;Day 32: Montenegro - Igla Ispod Praga (engl.: The Black Pin)\n\n&gt;Day 31: Monaco - La fille de Monaco (engl.: The Girl from Monaco)\n\n&gt;Day 30: Moldova - Carbon\n\n&gt;Day 29: Malta - Luzzu\n\n&gt;Day 28: Luxembourg - L\u00e4if a S\u00e9il (engl.: The Last Ashes)\n\n&gt;Day 27: Lithuania -Vaikai i\u0161 Amerikos vie\u0161bu\u010dio (engl.: The Children from the Hotel America)\n\n&gt;Day 26: Liechtenstein - Kinder der Berge\n\n&gt;Day 25: Latvia - Krimin\u0101l\u0101s ekselences fonds (engl.: The Foundation of Criminal Excellence)\n\n&gt;Day 24: Kosovo - Zgjoi (engl.: Hive)\n\n&gt;Day 23: Italy - Nuovo Cinema Paradiso (engl.: Cinema Paradiso)\n\n&gt;Day 22: Ireland - The Wind That Shakes the Barley\n\n&gt;Day 21: Iceland - Englar Alheimsins (engl.: Angels of the Universe)\n\n&gt;Day 20: Hungary - S\u00e1t\u00e1ntang\u00f3\n\n&gt;Day 19: Greece - \u039a\u03c5\u03bd\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 (engl.: Dogtooth)\n\n&gt;Day 18: Germany - Das Leben der Anderen (engl.: The Lives of Others)\n\n&gt;Day 17: Georgia - \u10ea\u10d8\u10e1\u10e4\u10d4\u10e0\u10d8 \u10db\u10d7\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8 \u10d0\u10dc\u10e3 \u10d3\u10d0\u10e3\u10ef\u10d4\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d4\u10da\u10d8 \u10d0\u10db\u10d1\u10d0\u10d5\u10d8 (engl.: Blue Mountains)\n\n&gt;Day 16: France - La Haine\n\n&gt;Day 15: Finland - Mies vailla menneisyytt\u00e4 (engl.: The Man Without a Past)\n\n&gt;Day 14: Estonia - Vehkleja (engl.: The Fencer)\n\n&gt;Day 13: Denmark - Jagten (engl.: The Hunt)\n\n&gt;Day 12: Czechia - Spalova\u010d mrtvol (engl.: The Cremator)\n\n&gt;Day 11: Cyprus - Smuggling Hendrix\n\n&gt;Day 10: Croatia - Kako je po\u010deo rat na mome otoku (engl.: How the War Started on My Island)\n\n&gt;Day 9: Bulgaria - \u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0435\u0441\u0438\u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0435\u0441\u0438 (engl.: Eastern Plays)\n\n&gt;Day 8: Bosnia and Herzegovina - Ni\u010dija zemlja (engl.: No Man's Land)\n\n&gt;Day 7: Belgium - In Bruges\n\n&gt;Day 6: Belarus - \u0418\u0434\u0438 \u0438 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438 (engl.: Come and See)\n\n&gt;Day 5: Azerbaijan - Yuxu (engl.: The Dream)\n\n&gt;Day 4: Austria - Funny Games\n\n&gt;Day 3: Armenia - \u0546\u057c\u0561\u0576 \u0563\u0578\u0582\u0575\u0576\u0568 (engl.: The Color of Pomegranates)\n\n&gt;Day 2: Andorra - El fred que crema (engl.: The Burning Cold)\n\n&gt;Day 1: Albania - Lulekuq\u00ebt mbi Mure (engl.: Red Poppies on Walls)",
