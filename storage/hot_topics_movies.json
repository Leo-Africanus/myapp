Long after everyone else has moved on, I'm still thinking about all the elements that go together to make this one-scene masterpiece. It's not just her performance (though that's the major part). It's how Batman and Catwoman and Jim Gordon are talking to her through a truck window, and at a lower height too. Just the absurdity of standing around outside a semi, looking up, listening to someone poignantly die. I think Cotillard understood the assignment: this is camp, so that's how I'm playing it. I'll never get tired of rewatching it.",

        "content": "I\u2019m looking for some good movie recommendations where the main character is trying to find a job, start a business, or build something from scratch. Job search is a priority, but business is not bad either. However, it has to be a main plot of the movie. Something similar to The Pursuit of Happyness, The Social Network, The Wolf of Wall Street, War Dogs, Scarface etc. It may be any story, inspiring, funny, or dark and criminal. It can be based on real events or totally fictional. Would love to hear any titles you think fit that theme! ",

Gay themed suggestions are appreciated although anything in the romance genre works.\n\nThanks all from my side, thanks :)\n\nI would leave an underrated suggestion for you guys called \"What's in it for love\" \n\nIt's a lovely romantic movie set in the UK.",

        "title": "There are some wild entries on this list of obscure box office bombs",
        "content": "I thought I'd share this video because I thought this guy did a fascinating take on the biggest bombs in Hollywood. He broke it down by year and I've never heard of a ton of these movies, even though I'm fascinated by box office bombs (which makes sense because, you know, they bomb when nobody sees them so there's nobody who remembers them). \n\nHis description and the footage he shows makes me want to watch a lot of these.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZK8irOr5A0\n\nHere are the crazier-sounding ones I'd never heard of before:\n\nSEXTETTE - 1978 - famous sexpot Mae West's last picture. She was 85, deaf and disoriented. People had to hold cue cards really close to her and she seemed to have no idea who her co-actors were in what seems to be a plot where a young Timothy Dalton is trying to seduce her.\n\nHONKEY TONK FREEWAY - 1981 - at the time, the most expensive comedy ever made. Apparently it made no sense, but they painted a real town pink, blew up a real bridge and put a real elephant on water skis.\n\nKRULL - 1983 - apparently meant to be the next Star Wars, this bomb had a young Liam Neeson. This one stands out to me because I had a Krull comic when I was a kid and I loved it. I had no idea it was based on a movie. I kind of want to see this *and* read the comic again.\n\nTHE COTTON CLUB - 1984 - Coppola's first bomb? The studio took it away to recut it, someone was murdered, the entire thing was derailed by a FBI investigation and it took 36 years for Coppola to do his intended cut of it.\n\nREVOLUTION - 1985 - I feel like I'm having a stroke writing this one out. Al Pacino was cast in a period piece, but he refused to wear period-appropriate footwear so they had to shoot him from the knees up to hide his modern boots. \n\nNORTH - 1994 - kid Elijah Wood in a bomb that had the director asking critics to go easy on it. I'm pretty sure I saw Bruce Willis, Julia Louise Dreyfuss and Jason Alexander in the footage.\n\nMARY REILLY - 1996 - I kind of remember this one, a movie about Dr. Jekyl's housekeeper, which turned out to be a pretty boring story.\n\nLEGENDS OF OZ: DOROTHY'S RETURN - 2014 - I had never heard about this, but I'm just going to quote the video, \"A disaster on every possible level. Legend of Oz pulled in just three point seven million on it's opening weekend... It wasn't just a flop, it was a scam. The shady studio behind it strong-armed pension funds into investing.\"\n \nPAN - 2015 - \"Another year, another reboot that tanked. Studio execs pitched this one as a dark reboot with a Moulin Rouge vibe. What they delivered was Hugh Jackman, in eyeliner, singing Nirvana with a children's choir.\"\n\nPLAYMOBIL: THE MOVIE - 2019 - I can't believe I never heard of this Lego rip-off starring Daniel Radcliffe. Narrator: \"Critics called it the biggest box office flop of all time, but they just didn't know what was going to happen next.\" (Covid happened next.)\n\nCHAOS WALKING- 2021 - I have no memory of this. It was filmed in 2017 and sat on a shelf for 4 years. Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley starred in this bomb that had the studio reshoot major parts of it (without the director) because test audiences had no idea what was going on.\n\nSTRANGE WORLD - 2022 - nothing noteworthy about this bomb except I'm shocked at how many recent films I'd never heard of. I expected to be pretty clueless about the ones from when I was a kid, not the ones from the most recent years of my life.\n\nLand Of The Lost was on this list and I genuinely like it. I'd heard about most of the other movies on the list because they're such famous bombs and you probably have, too.\n\nI'm not connected to the youtube channel, I'm just bored and needed something to pass the time.",
