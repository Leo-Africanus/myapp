        "content": "#[Here is the gamecard generator.](https://print-bingo.com/reddit/oscars2025.php) if you want to just nab one and skip the wall of text.\n\n---\n\nAlright everyone, Oscar Sunday is quickly approaching and with it the growing anticipation to simultaneously be enthralled and disappointed by the glamour and politics of Hollywood. Well, to make it all a little more interesting we are doing Oscar Bingo again this year. A week ago we [asked you guys to come up with things that might happen during the ceremony](https://old.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1itlqyx/oscar_bingo_xii_submission_thread/) and vote for your favorites. We then collected the top 65 plausible and non redundant submissions and our friends over at www.print-bingo.com made us a Bingo game card generator that has a ton of game cards for you fine folks to download.\n\n- Feel free to get however many you want for your needs but please don't waste them! \n\n- [Here is the gamecard generator.](https://print-bingo.com/reddit/oscars2025.php) Just do the captcha and your card will be generated via **link to a pdf.** You will have to click the link for the card, don't do the captcha a bunch of times because it's not automatically downloading. That wastes cards and each one could be a winner!\n\n- Check out [last year's game thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1bbnpzr/oscar_bingo_game_thread_xi/) for reference.\n\nEveryone is welcome to participate. On Oscar Sunday we will make an official game thread for everyone to discuss their cards and the game. The game thread will also serve as a referee zone for me and participating users to make judgement calls on the more ambiguous answers. Here are some things to know about the \"competition\" side of this little shindig:\n\n- If you win just be sure to yell \"BINGO\" really loud wherever you are. And if you wanna post your gamecard to the game thread that would be fine too.\n\n- This thread will be stickied until Oscar night when we make the game thread. There will also be an official Oscar discussion thread separate from the Bingo game thread.\n\n\nFinally, none of this ridiculousness could have been possible for such a large-scale website without print-bingo.com, and they have a message for us!\n\n*\"Print-Bingo.com is used by hundreds of teachers, event hosts, party organizers, and ex-pats in all corners of the globe to make both traditional and custom bingo cards through a web browser. We are happy to help Reddit with this fun, specialized, use of our website.\"*\n\nSo hey! Pick up a gamecard. Pick up 5. Play with your friends. Play alone with your cat. And let this be a reminder to all of us not to take the Oscars too seriously.",

He burned the baby\u2019s unfinished shirt she had been sewing before killing his brother in a rage. This shows why he felt he had nothing left and went on the crusade.

        "content": "I'm an avid movie/tv junky and have been since my teen years in the 80's'.\n\nThere are a number of films that i rewatch, usually about once a year, and a few weeks ago I watched\u00a0**Wind River**\u00a0(2017) and it still impresses me as such a great film. I was thinking about other films and tv shows that have intense scenes like the flanking scene, and came up with a few. I'm posting to see what ya'll can add to my small list so far.\n\n**13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi**\u00a0(2016)  \n\\- I'm watching this right now and the movie manages to maintain such intensity throughout, i just love it.\n\n**Sicario**\u00a0(2015)  \n\\- The border crossing scene is so great.\n\n**Heat**\u00a0(1995)  \n\\- I haven't rewatched in a while, but i do remember the big shoot-out scene as being pretty intense. It's time for a rewatch i think.\n\n**Bone Tomahawk**\u00a0(2015)  \n\\- I don't want to spoil anything for those that haven't seen it, but my recommendation if you have not is to go in blind and not read anything about it. It's just a great film.\n\n**The Revenant**\u00a0(2015)  \n\\- The bear attack is pretty riveting. The entire movie is pretty intense and a bit depressing, but i do like that there is a bit of justice in the end.\n\n**Saving Private Ryan**\u00a0(1998)  \n\\- The Knife kill scene is etched in my memory for all time.\n\nI will also mention\u00a0**Black Hawk Down**\u00a0(2001) and\u00a0**Band of Brothers**\u00a0(2001) which both have many such scenes, too many to list here. Also time for a rewatch i thinks.",

I'm talking casting choices people talk shit about even today but you kinda like\n\nFor me it's easily Scarlett Johansson as the lead in Ghost in a Shell (2017). I think she really channels the vibe of the animation and brought Motoko to life. despite not being Japanese. You can tell she did her homework on the character and it wasn't just an easy paycheck\n\nI'd say her biggest sin was being too big. she quickly became the female face of Hollywood, especially as an action star, aside from Black Widow I think Lucy came out before this and was critically panned. It also doesn't help that this movie wasn't great and didn't live up to the astronomical standards set by the anime. However, Scarjo did live up to it. I'll stand by that.",

        "content": "I just finished watching Deepwater Horizon, which is generally fine, but one thing I really appreciated was the way it found to explain what was happening on Deepwater Horizon and what Marky Mark's company did, thus allowing the rest of the movie to be a lot easier to understand from both a technical and political perspective. Basically, an early scene has Marky Mark's young daughter practicing her speech for class on what her Dad does, with a Coke can as a demonstration. \n\nThat got me wondering, in an era where so many movies seem to just plunk two characters down and have them talk about things that they are both already aware of solely for the audience's benefit (\"Wow, I can't believe it's been 5 years since you had that car accident where you lost your young son named Michael, after which your wife left you because she couldn't process her grief, and you moved back in with your estranged father....\"), do you have any other examples where a movie found an elegant or effective way to deliver some complicated backstory or foundational knowledge required to understand the specifics of the story?",

        "content": "My wife and I noticed a particularly specific trope while watching Despicable Me 4 tonight. An old man with a dog is sitting in front of a remote gas station when an extraordinary vehicle (space ship, high tech car, huge bus, etc.) arrives. A regular person exits the vehicle to do normal gas station things while the old man stares in stunned silence and the dog usually runs to hide. It\u2019s not the creepy gas attendant trope. It\u2019s always done as a comedic moment. We were wondering where this trope started from. If this isn\u2019t the place to ask, would you please point me in the right direction? I tried tvtropes but all I got from there is the creepy gas attendant trope.",

        "content": "Sometimes it's a feeling, a vibe. I can't really offer a viable explanation. I just love Chungking Express, It's a movie I caught on cable while I was in college and I'd be watching movies in my room and this one caught my eye. I liked it so much that I also saw Happy Together, which did not disappoint in any way. I was already obsessed with Leslie Cheung after I saw Farewell My Concubin but seeing him play such a sexually explicit role after seeing him play a LGBT-related part in Farewell where it's more toned down and restrained, I loved it. \n\nAnd I became a huge fan of Faye Wong and Brigitte Lin. I mean, Tony Leung is in it, and he's always excellent, but for me, Brigitte Lin was so fascinating as a woman with a Blonde wig, being very Ninotchka-like, not showing any emotion and still being flirted by this guy, and I adore Faye Wong in this. You can see why any man would be smitten by her.,",

Not that I want her to.)\n\n2) Great lines delivered exceptionally well and with perfect timing by Mr. CP.\n\n3) A fat dragon.\n\n4) Above average special effects, with the exception of one potato-throwing scene.\n\n5) Running joke about magic that echoes what I always think, but doesn\u2019t drag on past its usefulness.\n\n6) A complex plot that\u2019s clear enough not to feel complicated.\n\n7) An ending I should have seen coming but still made me cry. YES it\u2019s okay to cry over a fat dragon movie, although the fat dragon didn\u2019t make me cry and only featured in one of the quests.\n\nI look forward to all the comments agreeing with me.\n\n",
