I can\u2019t watch the full two hours, gotta cuddle my cats and watch YouTube chefs in between, because otherwise it\u2019s too much. That heavy feeling that settles into your chest, where you get the sense you\u2019re watching somebody\u2019s real life fall apart, that\u2019s how goddamn good these performances are. \n\nThey pull no punches at all. They make sure you feel everything. \n\nI can\u2019t say enough about this movie, it\u2019s so good. I don\u2019t know that I want to recommend it, due to the sheer emotional kick in the nuts, but on the other hand it\u2019s a masterpiece so yeah, if you haven\u2019t seen it, do yourself the dubious favor and do it. \n\nEdit - thank you for the soul-destroying suggestions.

The stylistic range, the pacing, the character arcs, the music, the cinematography\u2026 it\u2019s all so intentional, so bold, and so damn cool. It reminded me of just how thrilling movies can be when every frame feels like it was made with love and madness.\n\nI\u2019ve been craving that \u201choly sh*t, THIS is cinema\u201d feeling for a while now, and Kill Bill delivered it in spades. It\u2019s a reminder of why we fall in love with film in the first place.\n\nSo if it\u2019s been a few years\u2014or you\u2019ve only ever seen it once\u2014this is your sign to queue it up.

        "content": "Apologies if this question was asked, I don't know how to search for it.\n\nObjectively, yeah they're some master classes in filmmaking. S grade on everything: cinematography, acting, music, writing, directing, nothing more to be said, they're masterpieces of film.\n\nTheir statuses are well-deserved but I feel like it puts people nowadays off, makes everyone who hasn't seen them speculate about what makes them the GOAT. Maybe they think they're some boring art films, maybe they're highly nuanced and complex movies they're too tasteless and film-illiterate to \"get\", maybe they'll watch other movies before they could be cinema-literate enough to see why The Godfather Parts I and II are considered the greatest. At worst, they're the movies of people who are like \"I have good taste in film\". Then maybe they actually do watch but they either over-analyze and overthink everything on their first watch or they think nothing exciting really happens in this so-called Greatest Of All Time.\n\nI'd much rather not call these movies the greatest; rather I prefer to call them \"essential viewing for anybody who likes watching movies\" and even then, I think of them more like Rorschach tests. Perhaps they'll like it, perhaps not, perhaps it sticks with them, perhaps they'll forget it as soon as the credits stop rolling. What I think is essential is that if they like watching movies, The Godfather films should be among them, at least just once just to have an opinion on them.\n\nBut IMO they're really best watched just as another movie without titles like Essential or Greatest Of All Time. Maybe you're in the mood for a crime movie? Or you feel like watching a 70s movie or period piece? Or maybe you like Al Pacino? Or it's just a rainy Sunday with nothing else to do? I think that's the best way to watch The Godfather, as long as it's not just background noise while you do something else (and even then, you might catch a glimpse and be engrossed enough to stop what you're doing and watch!) because they're not revolutionary mindblowing pieces of art enjoyed only by the most cerebral; they're just really well-made movies. Watch and see if you like them or not. The dissection and analysis can come later or not at all.",

I just gave it a quick search and saw that it was George Clooney, Harvey Kitel, Selma Hyek and that Tarantino had something to do with it.

A well paced, good script, well acted movie about less known stories who arent as flashy and glamour.\n\nThere are so many aspect of baseball which i didnt get ofcourse but I dont even think this movie needs a person to know so much about baseball.\n\nPoint is this movie subverts almost every sports movie clich\u00e9. I am a big football fan and I follows different clubs, league games, manegerial stuff, transfers nd all And i can resonate every thing about movie. There\u2019s no big championship scene, no locker room speech, no slow-mo victory montage. Instead, it\u2019s about spreadsheets, stats, undervalued players and background story of how much pressure they go through.\n\nBrad pitt was just excellent and he should have won oscar for this one rather than OUATIH. Its simply one of the best nuanced performance i have ever seen. Brings so much depth to the character without going offbeat for once yet hit every stress conflict scenes perfectly. Probably my fav performance of him\n\nEmotional as well last scene, that daughter tape made me smile and sad at same time.\n\nIf there is any person who havent seen this movie, give it a chance its something very rare and fresh air. 10/10 already one of my all time fav movies list.",

        "content": "Basically, Thomas Wolfe's old saying of \"You can't go home again\" proven quite right. One of my favorite LOTR scenes is all about this; the scene in \"Return of the King\" after the four hobbits have returned to the Shire and are sitting at the Green Dragon pub surrounded by their fellow hobbits and awkwardly feeling out of place. It's a moment very akin to soldiers coming back from war and one that J.R.R. Tolkien, himself a WWI veteran, would approve of; the foursome have been through so much that they can never fit in amongst their fellow hobbits again (and indeed, not one of them ends up spending their final days in the Shire). It's not just \"how can we go back to our mundane old lives after everything we've been through\", it's also, \"wow, we've been outside the cave, we can never relate to these people again.\" It's one of the quietest moments of the trilogy and yet very effective in how much experiences can make your old life unobtainable again.",

        "content": "I enjoyed this movie a lot. From the opening music from LOTR to the art style and animation reminiscent of 80s and 90s fantasy anime, to the breathtaking visuals. It felt like a forgotten OVA from back in the day. I kept thinking of the Escaflowne anime film. Though it had a poor reception I didn't go in with low expectations since it's directed by Kenji Kamiyama. \n\nThe parts I didn't like were the universe building. Those are thankfully few and mostly after the story is done. Had this been an original fantasy story with no connection to LOTR it might have been even better.\n\nThe action is consistently well done. I liked how Hera has to use her wits to win and gradually becomes better at combat which makes the fight in the stables where she has no time for cleverness a standout and the one at the end cathartic. \n\nThere's nothing really surprising in the plot, no unexpected swerves or risks. It's just a straightforward narrative but it's done well. I understand that being a criticism but it's been so long since we had a good epic fantasy movie and this one ticks all the boxes for me. I loved how the siege took time, how, by the end, the villain didn't even know what he was fighting for. \n\nIf I have a complaint it's that the villain should've been fleshed out more. Everything we need to understand him is there but if this wasn't set in middle-earth and his arc didn't have to end the way it did maybe more could've been done with his character.\n\nUltimately it's the story of two childhood friends who suffer from the sins of their fathers. That throughout would've been better explored in a film with no ties middle-earth.\n\n",
