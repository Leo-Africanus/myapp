        "title": "April 11-13 Box Office Recap: On its second weekend, 'A Minecraft Movie' became the second biggest video game movie worldwide with $552 million. 'The King of Kings' over-performs projections, 'Warfare' opens decently, while 'The Amateur' and 'Drop' underwhelm.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/5wk8mzvkhvue1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ba860803c8b374c941afb76643bcd1250c8556d\n\nDespite four wide releases this weekend, none of them could fight ***A Minecraft Movie*** for the top spot. ***The King of Kings*** delivered Angel Studios' second biggest debut, while stuff like ***The Amateur*** and ***Drop*** failed to light things up, although ***Warfare*** had a solid start.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $145.1 million this weekend. That's up a colossal 112.4% from last year, when ***Civil War*** debuted with A24's biggest opener.\n\n***A Minecraft Movie*** was still at #1, adding $78.5 million. That's a 52% drop; not as bad as some other video game films, but it's also quite rough for a family flick. For contrast, ***The Super Mario Bros. Movie*** dropped 36.9% on its second weekend. Through 10 days, the film has earned $278.8 million, and it's still on track to finish with over $450 million domestically.\n\nIn second place, Angel Studios' ***The King of Kings*** earned $19.2 million in 3,200 theaters. That's the studio's second biggest debut, behind ***Sound of Freedom*** ($19.6 million). It's also the biggest debut for an animated bible film, surpassing ***The Prince of Egypt*** ($14.5 million), although ***Prince*** sold more tickets adjusted for inflation.\n\nThis is promising, and Angel Studios did a fantastic job with marketing. Not to mention having the film open with Easter around the corner, which should help it leg out. Like their prior films, they used the \"Pay It Forward\" feature, wherein someone can pay for a ticket for anyone else. The numbers reported are only those that were redeemed this weekend.\n\nAccording to Angel Studios, 59% of the audience was female. Despite middling critic reviews, the audience loved it more: they gave it a rare \"A+\" on CinemaScore, indicating strong word of mouth. The film should leg out all the way to $60 million at the very least, especially with no animated competition till June.\n\nIn third place, 20th Century Studios' ***The Amateur*** debuted with $14.8 million this weekend. This debut is lower than the recent action film ***A Working Man*** ($15.5 million), although that had a more bankable name in the lead role.\n\nWhile it's tough to get better numbers, one still thinks that the film could've opened higher than this. After all, Disney and 20th Century mounted an extensive campaign for the film, hoping to replicate other action film successes. But the thing with ***The Amateur*** is that it simply didn't offer anything new in the genre: a man loses his wife and sets out to get revenge. That's a genre that has been copied so many times, and it's tough to get excited for the 37th time it's played out. Even reviews (62% on RT) aren't really glowing.\n\nAccording to 20th Century Studios, 57% of the audience was male, and 47% was 25 and over. They gave it a so-so \"B+\" on CinemaScore, which doesn't exactly inspire confidence. With options like ***Sinners*** and ***The Accountant 2*** coming up, it'd be a surprise if ***The Amateur*** got close to $40 million lifetime.\n\nIn fourth place, A24's ***Warfare*** debuted with $8.3 million in 2,670 theaters. That's A24's sixth biggest debut, and while far off from Alex Garland's ***Civil War*** ($25.5 million), it wasn't ever going to come close to those numbers.\n\nAll in all, it's a solid start for the film. War films have been finding success in theaters, although films revolving around Iraq War have been quite inconsistent; some have succeeded (***American Sniper*** and ***The Hurt Locker***), others not so much (***Green Zone*** and ***Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk***). A24 did a great job in emphasizing the film's plot points: a real-time story of soldiers in Iraq. Some fantastic reviews (94% on RT) certainly helped as well.\n\nAccording to A24, 72% of the audience was male, and 53% was 25 and over. They gave it a great \"A\u2013\" on CinemaScore, which is A24's best grade (their only other film to get this grade was ***The Iron Claw***). This is very encouraging, and suggests the film could leg out. For now, a $25 million domestic total is likely for ***Warfare***.\n\nIn fifth place, Universal/Blumhouse's ***Drop*** earned just $7.3 million in 3,085 theaters. That's below other Blumhouse titles like ***The Woman in the Yard*** ($9.3 million) and ***Wolf Man*** ($10 million). These numbers are also below director Christopher Landon's ***Happy Death Day 2U*** ($9.8 million), which was considered a disappointment back in 2019.\n\nEven though the film cost just $11 million, it feels like Universal simply didn't know what to do with the film. Even though they premiered it at SXSW, where it earned great reviews (83% on RT), it feels like they didn't push it hard enough. Or maybe the concept: a woman asked to kill her date to save her family didn't entice audiences. It's not unreasonable to believe that had the film come out during Blumhouse's golden years, it could've opened with $20 million or more. Are audiences giving up on Blumhouse? \n\nAccording to Universal, 53% of the audience was female and 35% was in the 25-34 demographic. They gave it a middling \"B\" on CinemaScore; this is not bad, but it's not great either. With some competition on the way, it's unlikely it save some face. It'd be a surprise if the film came anywhere close to $25 million lifetime.\n\n***The Chosen: Last Supper \u2014 Part 3*** earned $6 million this weekend. That's a 14% drop from ***Part 2*** ($6.9 million) last week. Across these 3 films, they have amassed $36.3 million domestically.\n\n***A Working Man*** was hit hard by the newcomers. It dropped a steep 59%, adding $3 million this weekend. The film has earned $33.4 million so far, and it looks like it will struggle to hit $40 million domestically.\n\nDisney's ***Snow White*** continues its freefall. The film now dropped 51%, adding just $2.8 million this weekend. Clearly, this film simply has no legs. The film has earned just $82 million so far, and it's guaranteed to finish below $90 million domestically. Terrible all around.\n\nNinth place belonged to Blumhouse's ***The Woman in the Yard***, which fell 54% and added $2 million this weekend. The film has earned $20.3 million so far, and it's finishing with something close to $25 million.\n\nRounding up the Top 10 was ***The Chosen: Last Supper \u2014 Part 2***. The film collapsed 86% this weekend, earning $961,861 this weekend. Through 10 days, it has earned $10.9 million so far.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***A Minecraft Movie*** was still the #1 movie overseas. It added $79.6 million, taking its worldwide total to a colossal $552 million after just 2 weekends. The best markets are the UK ($39.8M), China ($20.3M), Germany ($18.9M), Mexico ($18.7M) and Australia ($18.5M). With this, it has already passed the ***Sonic*** movies to become the second biggest video game movie ever. The billion milestone is becoming more and more likely.\n\n***The Amateur*** slightly over-performed projections overseas, earning $17.2 million for a $32.2 million worldwide debut. The best debuts were in France ($1.6M), the UK ($1.4M), Mexico ($1.4M), Germany ($1.1M) and Japan ($1.1M). Based on the pattern of other action films, the film should hit the $100 million milestone, although some rough competition will put a challenge to that.\n\n***Snow White*** is nearing the end of its run worldwide. The film added just $4.7 million overseas, for a terrible $182.3 million worldwide total. Based on its drops, it looks like the film might go under $200 million worldwide. On a $270 million budget. Ouch.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Moana 2* | Nov/27 | Disney | $139,787,385 | $460,405,297 | $1,059,197,729 | $150M\n*Novocaine* | Mar/14 | Paramount | $8,809,436 | $19,861,854 | $33,545,800 | $18M\n\n- ***Moana 2*** has closed with $1.059 billion worldwide. Considering it was heading straight to streaming, that's a huge win for Disney Animation. Even if the quality of the film suffered as a result. The film debuted with a gigantic $389 million worldwide, which was the biggest debut for an animated title. But the film proved to be a bit front-loaded, especially for an animated film. A third film is inevitable, but Disney should really begin development as a film, not a half-assed TV show changed to a film.\n\n- No pain, no gain. Paramount's ***Novocaine*** closed with just $33 million worldwide, failing to recoup its $18 million budget. That's eerily close the numbers earned by Jack Quaid's previous film, ***Companion***. Despite hitting #1 on its opening weekend, the film simply couldn't find an audience in the weeks afterwards. Quaid may be popular online, but that doesn't mean people are paying to watch him lead a movie.\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nOne film will try to challenge ***Minecraft*** for the top spot.\n\nThat film is Ryan Coogler's ***Sinners***, which stars Michael B. Jordan in a dual role in this horror title. Warner Bros. has backed up the film with an extensive marketing campaign, granting Coogler with his terms: the film's rights will revert back to him in 25 years. Coogler has had massive success with the ***Creed*** and ***Black Panther*** films, but this is his first major original film. And early reviews suggest he really cooked: it's sitting at a fantastic 100% on RT with 45 reviews so far. The big question is: will audiences support this?\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

        "title": "[US] The King of Kings (2025): Y'know, for kids. (Jesus Christ!)",
        "content": "I was made to watch *The King of Kings* yesterday, and I\u2019m still processing the fact that someone watched *The Passion of the Christ* and thought:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s do that again. But make it adorable.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no mystery to what this is\u2014it\u2019s a sermon dressed as an animated film. Imagine if *The Prince of Egypt* had less artistry, less heart, and more of that weird Sunday school energy where you\u2019re afraid to ask questions. That\u2019s this.\n\nThe movie starts with Charles Dickens (yes, really) telling his kids bedtime stories about Jesus, which somehow becomes the framing device for a full-on Gospel recap. The animation? Think *Pixar meets Playmobil*. Big heads. Smooth, rubbery faces. That eerie uncanny valley where everyone looks like they were designed in a Christian metaverse.\n\nBut the tone is the real kicker. One second you\u2019re watching cartoon kids giggle at the manger. The next, Jesus is being flogged behind a post by a dead-eyed Roman doll with a whip. When they lift Funko-Jesus onto the cross, I actually said \u201cno way\u201d out loud.\n\nThis movie in the (un)holy baby of tonal mismatch and weird choices: Roman officials are \u201ccomplex,\u201d but every Jewish character who questions Jesus is a full-on villain with the face of a propaganda sketch. That\u2019s not subtext. That\u2019s just text.\n\nTo be clear: If you want to show this to your kids, fine. But don\u2019t pretend this is a movie. It\u2019s a delivery system for doctrine. And at times, it feels like the kind of doctrine that doesn\u2019t trust children to think for themselves.\n\nThis\u2019ll be sold as wholesome family entertainment. Personally? I think it\u2019s a little terrifying.",

        "content": "Buster Keaton being famous for his courage and willignness to pull of some crazy stunts, giving us some of the best slapstick and stunt comedy films ever made. To this date there hasn't been anybody nearly at his level (and courage) to pull off some of the things he did. \n\nThe closest to him currently is Tom Cruise who has become well known (among other things) for his own willingness to pull of some crazy stunts. As the Mission Impossible series has shown us, as well as Top Gun and other films, Tom Cruise is always pushing his own limits and challenging his own capabilities in his stunt work, all for the sake of cinema. \n\nFor that reason, I would LOVE to see a modern Buster Keaton style slapstick film, feeling like Tom Cruise is the only one with the capability to pull it off. What made Buster Keaton films so great was both the stunts and also the dry deadpan humor. Keaton's stoicism to the chaos around him is something we've seen with Leslie Nielsen in Airplane/Naked Gun. \n\nLeslie Nielsen experienced a career renaissance that made him a household name in comedy, despite having no comedic chops himself. Simply because he used deadpan humor and being the every man who pretends like everything is normal as the chaos unfolds around him.\n\nThis is where I think Tom Cruise would be perfect to do a Buster Keaton style film. As an action star Tom Cruise isn't well known for his comedic chops, but he doesn't need to be. He can maintain the deadpan seriousness and stoicism of Buster Keaton and Leslie Nielson reacting to the craziness happening around him and showing off his stunting capabilities in increasingly absurd situations.

        "title": "Hollywood Is Cranking Out Original Movies. Audiences Aren\u2019t Showing Up.",
        "content": "LOS ANGELES\u2014When director Christopher Landon introduced his new thriller, \u201cDrop,\u201d before its premiere at the Chinese Theater on Hollywood\u2019s Walk of Fame, he had a warning for the packed auditorium.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard out there for an original movie,\u201d he said, urging everyone who liked the Universal Pictures release to \u201cscream it from the rooftops\u201d and on social media.\n\n\u201cDrop\u201d opened this weekend to an estimated $7.5 million domestically, one of two new movies based on fresh ideas that fizzled at the box office. The other was Disney\u2019s \u201cThe Amateur,\u201d a spy thriller adapted from a little-known 1981 book, which opened to an estimated $15 million.\n\nAfter years of gripes from average moviegoers and Hollywood insiders alike about the seemingly nonstop barrage of sequels, spin-offs, and adaptations of comic books and toys, the film industry placed more bets on original ideas.\n\nThe results have been ugly. \n\nNearly every movie released by a major studio in the past year based on an original script or a little-known book has been a box-office disappointment. Before this weekend\u2019s flops were Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s\u201cMickey 17\u201d and \u201cThe Alto Knights,\u201d Paramount\u2019s \u201cNovocaine,\u201d Apple\u2019s \u201cFly Me to the Moon,\u201d Amazon\u2019s \u201cRed One,\u201d and the independently financed \u201cHorizon: An American Saga Chapter 1\u201d and \u201cMegalopolis.\u201d\n\nJason Blum, who produced \u201cDrop\u201d and built his company Blumhouse largely on original horror franchises, said audiences\u2019 preference for known properties has made it harder to release original movies in theaters, \u201ceven though that\u2019s where some of the most exciting and risky storytelling still lives.\u201d\n\nGetting people into theaters more frequently is a priority for a movie industry still recovering from the pandemic. Box-office revenue in the first three months of this year in the U.S. and Canada was the lowest it has been, excluding the pandemic, since 1996.\n\nAt the CinemaCon industry convention in early April, theater owners said they welcome more original films, but only if they are backed by robust advertising campaigns. Building buzz for a new film in a media environment fractured between YouTube, TikTok, streaming and sports is tough, particularly when it is an unknown title.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re opening films that have almost zero awareness,\u201d said Bill Barstow, president of Main Street Theatres, a small Nebraska-based chain.\n\nMany consumers are content to wait until an original motion picture is available to rent online a few weeks after its theatrical release or to stream on a service like Netflix in a few months.\n\nThe only films succeeding in the current environment are those with built-in audiences, like \u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d which was released in early April and has grossed more than $280 million domestically. And these days, even franchises can be far from a sure thing. Long-running series such as Marvel and DC superheroes and live-action remakes of Disney animated classics are showing their age and proving unreliable at the box office.\n\nStudios say they have little choice but to make more original movies they hope will buck the odds.\n\n\u201cTelling original stories and taking risks is the only path toward creating new global franchises,\u201d Bill Damaschke, Warner Bros.\u2019 head of animation, said at CinemaCon.\n\nSome of the increase in original film releases is attributable to Amazon and Apple, which are building film businesses with few well-established franchises. One of the biggest bets on an original film from any company this year is Apple\u2019s \u201cF1,\u201d a June release starring Brad Pitt as a race-car driver.\n\nAmazon hyped 11 coming movies to exhibitors at CinemaCon, of which six were originals. Among traditional studios, Warner Bros. is taking the most risks on originals, with big budget films from directors Paul Thomas Anderson and Maggie Gyllenhaal. \n\nHollywood\u2019s next original release comes Friday with Warner\u2019s \u201cSinners,\u201d a horror movie starring Michael B. Jordan. Next month even Marvel, home to Hollywood\u2019s biggest franchises, is taking a gamble with \u201cThunderbolts,\u201d about a super team brand new to all but the most devoted comic-book readers.",

        "title": "Boiling Point (2021) pulls off a 90 minute single take and is probably my favorite movie with this \"gimmick\"",
        "content": "Decided to watch this after being super impressed with director Philip Barantini's work on the Netflix show Adolescence. The way he stages and blocks his actors in order to pull off this technical feat is nothing short of brilliant. The movie is incredibly tense, set in a single night in a busy restaurant, and the camerawork massively contributes to this overwhelming sense of dread that lingers over every scene. Stephen Graham and Vinette Robinson are absolutely magnetic as the head chef and sous chef, Robinson especially absolutely kills it during this one scene where she delivers the most realistic frustrated monologue I think I've ever watched (I think she flubs a couple lines but it added to the sense of realism, I often stumble over my words when angry, too). I've seen a few films that try this same gimmick - Birdman is fantastic, Victoria is awesome, 1917 is masterful. But while those movies are technical marvels in their own rights and maybe manage to pull off some flashier camera moves, none of them made me feel as claustrophobic and tense as this one. The simple, familiar setting, the naturalistic dialogue where people talk over each other and fumble their words, the sound design emphasizing the bustle of a busy restaurant. All of it gels into a single 90 minute heart attack, in the spirit of the Safdie Brothers.",

You have an absolute all-star cast with Rachel McAdams, Benny Safdie, and Kathy Bates, and you have arguably the most beloved women's coming-of-age story from the last century. It's like a literal match made in heaven. \n\nThen they don't market it, at all. Pretty sure I saw a trailer in an AMC theater once (as AMC theaters will typically show every trailer known to man before a movie) and passed it off as a cash-grab limited release since I hadn't even heard that it was happening. It did really well with the critics and even grossed more than Edge of Seventeen despite the lack of marketing (though failed to meet the higher budget).\n\nI feel like they could have had an absolute smash hit if they had marketed it even once. Just anything other than just a trailer would have made this movie a lot more money by capitalizing off of the Edge of Seventeen director and the fact that it's a beloved book.",

It\u2019s not showy grief, but it\u2019s a sorta it\u2019s muffled grief, which hits wayyyy harder IMO. The way he talks about his wife and kids, or more often doesn\u2019t, is quietly devastating. Cheadle as well is phenomenal in this. He is always a perfect grounding force. In that scene in the courtroom where Sandler finally lets it out, feels like a cracked dam during a hurricane. Easily one of Sandler\u2019s most emotionally truthful roles, it feels like he\u2019s in the same headspace as like Uncut Gems but inverted. If that one is manic desperation then Reign Over Me is him suffering from a severe stillness in sorrow.\n ",
