        "content": "Every actor goes through the process of self-shooting audition tapes. These tapes get sent to directors who are considering you for a part. The teams watch the tapes and then cast based on them.\n\nSometimes the actors are in the room, but a lot of times you're just watching someone deliver lines and hoping they show you enough to make it count. For actors, this lifeless shot in the dark is part of the process. But it can also be hard if you're not good with a\u00a0[camera](https://nofilmschool.com/topics/cinematography-cameras),\u00a0[lighting](https://nofilmschool.com/learn-basics-of-cinematography), or just\u00a0[editing](https://nofilmschool.com/hollywood-editing-success-using-adobe-premiere-pro)\u00a0your own stuff.\u00a0\n\nWell, when Josh Brolin was working with\u00a0[Quentin Tarantino](https://nofilmschool.com/tarantino-directing-actors)\u00a0and\u00a0[Robert Rodriguez](https://nofilmschool.com/pulp-fiction-star-wars)\u00a0on\u00a0*Grindhouse*, he got a call from his agents. The\u00a0[Coen brothers](https://nofilmschool.com/coen-brothers-quotes)\u00a0wanted him to do a self-tape for\u00a0*No Country for Old Men.*\u00a0Brolin was excited but knew to land a Coen movie his audition had to stand out. He approached Tarantino and Rodriguez at lunch one day and asked if they'd shoot him doing it. They agreed.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBrolin told\u00a0[Collider](https://collider.com/josh-brolin-interview-no-country-for-old-men/), \"Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarrantino filmed my first audition on a $1 million Genesis camera during lunch during\u00a0*Grindhouse,*\u00a0and so that was a really cool-looking audition, but I didn\u2019t get the part.\u00a0It was turned down.\"\u00a0\n\nIt turns out, the audition looked so good all the Coens wanted to know was who shot it. After they got the explanation they didn't reach back out.\n\nBut Brolin was set on the role, so he had to pursue it himself.\n\nHe said, \"They watched it and their response was, 'Who lit it?' But I was much bigger and I had a goatee but it had nothing to do with the physicality, they just didn\u2019t see it.\u00a0It\u2019s not what they were looking for at that moment.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t resonating, and I have a brilliant agent who just became a persistent pest and just said 'meet him, meet him, meet him, meet him. Not he\u2019s perfect for the part, not you\u2019re making a mistake just meet him.'\u00a0",

He just plays this sleazy creep so well, despite him usually being a good/grey guy. The scene where he dances and sings to love is the drug is the best part of the movie, dude has a great voice\n\nThe overall vibe of this character + his dancing may as well have been an audition for his character in Ex Machina",

        "content": "I'm pretty sure i'm correct but i could just be dumb lol. In the film, there is a scene with the 2 door riddle (2 doors and 2 guards, one guard only tells the truth and the other only tells lies, you get one question posed to one guard to determine which door leads to the castle). Jennifer Connolly points at one door and asks one guard \"Answer yes or no - would he (the other guard) tell me that this door leads to the castle?\" Making it a yes or no question while referring to one of the doors specifically in this way would NOT work, right? As far as i can tell, the question needs to be \"Which door would the other guard tell me leads to the castle?\"",

        "title": "20 fun facts about the muppet christmas carol.",
        "content": "with only a few days left before thanksgiving, christmas is coming closer and closer. we all have our christmas traditions. and one christmas tradition is watching christmas movies. and one of the movies that i like to pop into the DVD player every christmas season is 1992's the muppet christmas carol. the muppet christmas carol is not only considered to be the only muppet movie that could rival the muppet movie for the title of the best muppet movie but is also considered one of the best adaptations of charles dickin's novel with many going so far as to call it THE best. while i don't think it's the best adaptation(my personal favorite is the alastair sims version in case you were curious), i do still think it's quite great and i have it to thank for introducing me to one of the best stories ever written.\n\nthe film has quite a bit of interesting trivia surrounding it and i thought it would be fun to post some of them onto this sub to hopefully give you all a newfound appreciation for this holiday classic.\n\n20: this was the first muppet project to feature gonzo and rizzo as a duo. since then, the two have been considered inseparable.\n\n19: many of the extras in the street scenes are puppeteers. look closely and you can just about see the muppets some of them are walking with.\n\n18: the voice of the ghost of christmas past was performed by jessica fox. if that name sounds familiar, she plays enid on the worst witch and nancy on hollyoaks. this was her film debut. \n\n17: this is actually not the first time that the muppets have done a christmas carol. several years prior, a Muppet based adaptation of a christmas carol was done in the form of a comic in muppet magazine. like in muppet christmas carol, kermit is bob crachit, miss piggy is his wife, and robin is tiny tim. \n\n16: in exchange for fetching the poulterer, scrooge offers bean bunny first a shilling, then raises it to 5 shillings. in the original novel, and most adaptations, scrooge first offers the boy a shilling, then raises it to half a crown. half a crown is worth 2 shillings and 6 pence. a crown is 5 shillings. bean bunny made out with double what most versions of his character do.\n\n15: in the DVD commentary, the filmmakers relaid a funny story from a test screening. during the montage at the end of the film, scrooge gives the bookkeepers some coal to keep warm. a few children in the audience asked what the bookkeepers had done wrong to deserve coal. it had completely slipped their minds that santa gives naughty children coal.\n\n14: speaking of the ending, when scrooge meets the charity men out on the streets, they are standing in front of a tavern with a sign that says \"grape tavern\". this may not seem noteworthy except for the fact that grape tavern is not only a real tavern but it's the oldest tavern in london. it was erected in 1583 and was visited by the likes of william shakespeare and charles dickins.\n\n13: during the \"with a thankful heart\" musical number at the end, pay very close attention to the shops in the background. there's one shop named statler and waldorf's, an obvious reference to the famous muppet hecklers. however, there's another shop with the name micklewhite's. this is a reference to michael caine's real name, maurice micklewhite.\n\n12: rowlf the dog has a brief appearance in the film but does not speak. although kermit was jim henson's signature character, rowlf was his favorite to perform and the character that henson felt the closest to. following henson's death, rowlf did not have a speaking appearance for a decade. it was only in the 2000s that bill baretta took over as rowlf's primary performer.\n\n11: prior to this film, it was an unofficial tradition for theatrical muppet movies to feature cameos by characters from sesame street. however, after disney acquired the rights to the muppets, this tradition stopped due to rights issues. this was the first muppet movie in which characters from sesame street do not appear. however, there are appearances by characters from fraggle rock. keep your eyes peeled for mudwell the mudbunny, sprocket, and wander mcmooch.\n\n10: there is an extra verse of \"marley and marley\" at the end of the song. it is absent from the film but is featured on the official soundtrack. it goes as follows. \"We're Marley and Marley, And now it's time to part (doot doot) To go back where they keep our kind, The wretched and the heartless The news we've shared has got you scared We're glad that we got through So make amends (and make some friends!) The future's up to you.\"\n\n9: the original idea for the film was for it to be a parody of a christmas carol rather then a straight adaptation. however, screenwriter jerry juhl convinced the muppeteers to go with a straight adaptation. similarly, the original plan was for the 3 ghosts to be portrayed by muppets. christmas past would have been played by miss piggy, christmas present would have been played by scooter, and christmas yet to come would have been played by gonzo, who's signature nose would have sitcking out of the black hood. eventually, the decision was made to create original puppets to play those characters. miss piggy ended up playing miss crachit, gonzo ended up being the narrator, and scooter was absent.\n\n8: the ghost of christmas past was created by making a special puppet that was operated in a tank of water and then greenscreened into the movie. this gave the spirit the appearance of floating. \n\n7: numerous actors were considered for the role of Ebenezer scrooge. among the actors considered were peter o toole, george carlin, ron moody, and david warner. if warner had been cast, it would have been his second time acting in an adaptation of a christmas carol, having previously played the role of bob crachit in the george C scott adaptation. jack lemmon was also offered the role but, after saying that he'd rather play kermit instead, he was deemed crazy. bob hoskins was also considered but was deemed too short. michael caine got the role instead.\n\n6: before production began, michael caine told brian henson that, even though he was acting in a muppet movie, he planned to play the role of scrooge completely straight as if he was acting with the royal shakespeare company. henson gave caine his blessing. and it ended up paying off since caine's performance is often considered to be one of the best things about the movie and many consider him to be among the best scrooge's. despite his commitment to playing the role straight, caine still had lots of fun on the set and he considers muppet christmas carol to be among his favorite movies he's been involved with.\n\n5: this film was the first major muppet project after the death of jim henson as well as the first major muppet project with steve whitmare as kermit. the film was dedicated to both henson and richard hunt, a muppeteer who had died of aids earlier in the year.\n\n4: it's difficult to talk about the movie without mentioning the fact that \"when love is gone\", the song sung by scrooge's ex fiance belle, was cut from the theatrical cut due to being deemed too sad for children. the last minute decision resulted in an extremely jarring edit where scrooge and rizzo's reactions seem disproportionate to what was shown. the number was restored on the VHS, laserdisc, and first DVD release. however, it remains cut from most TV airings, the blu ray release, and the disney+ plus, although it is available as a bonus feature on disney+. \n\n3: the film was originally planned to be a TV special before being changed to a theatrical release. despite solid critical reviews, the film opened in sixth place during the 1992 holiday box office. many attribute this to the film facing competition from home alone 2 lost in new york and Aladdin. \n\n2: there were two songs that were cut from the movie but do appear on the soundtrack. the first is \"room in your heart\" which is sung by bunsen honeydew and beaker as the charity workers. the second is \"chairman of the board\" which is sung by sam the eagle as scrooge's headmaster. both songs were cut before production began and the only evidence of their existence is their appearance on the soundtrack.\n\n1: despite being a largely faithful adaptation of a christmas carol, there are some very noticeable differences. in this film, jacob marley is split into two characters named jacob and robert marley. the characters of fan and ignorance and want are also absent. the crachits also have a second daughter named bellina, who is exclusive to this film.",
