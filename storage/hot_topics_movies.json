Over the course of the month I decided to try to watch the equivalent of one movie a day all year. Well, I finished early and I learned 3 things. \n\n1: People are in entirely too many movies.  I know actors gotta eat, but man, I saw so much cross over from actors in the last 10 years. It got so bad that I started recognizing people who weren\u2019t even IN other movies. \n\n2: You can really tell when a movie has a budget. Watching primary low-mid budget horror movies, you can really tell the difference when a movie has a bit of money to make everything look good. \n\n3: If your movie isn\u2019t 2 hours then it only needs to be an hour and a half. None of this 1:45 nonsense. Either pad it out to 2 hours or ideally, cut it down to a buck thirty.  Especially (not Sexually! lol)  if you are making a horror movie. \n\nCouple of facts: \n\nFirst movie I watched: Cube 2: hypercube\n\nLast movie: Planes trains and automobiles. \n\nBest movie: American Fiction \n\nWorst Movie: The Creeps.  \n\nMovies I watched that I had seen before: 16\n\nMost movies watched in a single day: 5\n\n\nIt\u2019s been a long year and I\u2019ve enjoyed having something else to focus on.  Hope this finds you well, and watch more movies. \n\nEdit: sexually lol \n\nAs requested Top 10: \n\n1: American Fiction\n\n2: biosphere \n\n3: They Cloned Tyrone \n\n4: 1917\n\n5: Maxxxine \n\n6: the Blackening\n\n7: the vast of night \n\n8: The green knight \n\n9: bottoms \n\n10: Shadow in the cloud (seriously I dare you not to love this)",

Was also just a beautiful conclusion to Jesse\u2019s story. \n\nThe Simpson\u2019s Movie was probably my second favourite. The Simpsons is probably one of my favourite TV shows of all time, and my favourite cartoon/animation by far. The movie wasn\u2019t much of a step down from the series and episodes themselves. It was just as funny as most episodes are, but had a lot more emotions in it. I also much preferred the animation style it had than what the series turned into a couple years later. ",

At first I figured \"big population, makes sense\" but then I noticed that they're *all* from 1979 to 1985. What's up with that? There are FOUR movies from 1980 alone that had more box office admissions than Titanic (the largest non-Chinese movie in terms of box office admissions). The idea of that many movies from the *same* year being that big is insane to me. What was going on during this period?\n\nI tried asking some Chinese friends of mine, and while they recognized some of the movies, they weren't really sure why it only lasted during this 6 year timeframe. One suggested that the Tiananmen Square incident could've brought an end to it, but that was in 1989, which would still leave an unexplained 4 year gap. I wasn't sure if I should ask this here, r/AskHistorians, or some other sub, but if anyone has any ideas, let me know.\n\nI also noticed a surprising lack of Indian movies, given the reputation of Bollywood and size of India. If population were the sole reason, I would figure India would also take several of the top spots on that list.",

        "content": "Crappy last few months and nursing a broken heart and nowhere to go on Thanksgiving. Planning on spending the day with my cat but could use some distraction and comfort in art.\n\nI am sure I am not the only one.\n\nSo are there any recommendations for us? Please, no love stories or family themed films (ie Paddington). All other genres are a go.\n\nFor example, I find Alien and Aliens to be great distractions to get my mind off of my emotions. \n\nThanks.",
