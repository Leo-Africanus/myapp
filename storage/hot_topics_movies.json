        "content": "In 28 Weeks Later part of the premise is that mother of the children Alice is left behind in mainland Britain with the infected, when found she carries the infection but is asymptomatic. I was rewatching 28 Weeks Later today and it is clear that Alice is not actually asymptomatic at all. Although she appears to largely retain her memories and her basic faculties, she displays all the signs of infection such as disfigurement (one of her eyes is heavily bloodshot), insanity she is found cowering alone in a room covered in crosses and symbols, aggression (both passive and overt), she appears to attempt to hurt her son and then when questioned by the US military she remains silent during questioning, possibly suggesting anger and an ulterior motive. The fact she allows her husband to kiss her could possibly be a sign of calculation, if she knows she is carrying the virus.\n\nOne of the main things I noticed in the room Alice was found hiding in is that it is covered in crosses drawn on the wall. The same symbol seen heavily in the 28 Years Later trailer.\n\nI wonder if Alice was actually the first of the new type of infected we will see in 28 Years?",

        "title": "Unforgiven is one of Clint Eastwood's best movies as a director ever. I mean imagine deconstructing the gunslinger image that made you a star, and stripping away the glamor behind the Wild West.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/yicntwi7lq6e1.png?width=219&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4058b385363489b27ba3d34b8e628fe804990207\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5a7q1fr9lq6e1.png?width=320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49d5e104f8f85d119d971b127d6b9177902447d2\n\nWilliam Munny is everything that Clint Eastwood was not in his hey days. He can't mount a horse, he can't shoot straight, his hands shake when holding a gun. In one shot, Clint Eastwood demystified and deglamorized the gun slinger, the cowboy. He stripped him of his super hero status and showed he was some one like us, as vulnerable as could be.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9eglkeoplq6e1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=beb95dfb6da04b33733c5019ea3b5560fbd7cafb\n\n\n\nBut much before too, the romance behind Wild West, gets busted in the scene where the \u00a0sheriff Little Bill( Gene Hackmann), shows the grimy reality to the starry eyed English Bob. English Bob's romantic visions are shattered, when he finds himself face to face with the actual violence, he can't handle it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ldzw7xhwlq6e1.png?width=320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79aa0d2c215f80f0c576af8e80fa301e9379f207\n\nCharacters here don't revel in the violence, they are horrified and appalled by it. The Schofeld Kid and English Bob find reality too uncomfortable to handle. Ned Logan( Morgan Freeman) is more of a pacifist, who wants to opt out of the mission, a decision that proves tragic for him. And William Munny himself is on the mission for some money, rather than any honor.\n\nIt is a Western in which there are no heroes and villains per se. William Munny's background is shown to be a sociopath who had no qualms about killing left, right and center. Little Bill while vicious and sadist, is also a God fearing sheriff, who wants to keep the town clean. There are no clear cut black and white, pretty much large swathes of grey.\n\nAnd it has 3 great actors at the top of their game, Clint Eastwood essentially parodying his own image, just check the scene where he tests his shooting skills. Gene Hackmann as the Sheriff, in a morally ambigous character, you hate him when he tortures Morgan Freeman, but then you see that he just wants to keep the town clean, and will do anything for it. And Freeman is as reliable as ever as the soft spoken Ned.",

        "content": "I have seen the trailer \"Cleaner\" starring Daisy Ridley and it seems that the filmmakers have taken cues from the film \"Die Hard\". However, I've noticed something when others are taking inspirations from the said film. John McLane is basically a normal cop who is just trying to fix his marriage to his wife who is working in the building that he came in. When the hostage ensues and his wife is one of those hostages, he was forced to take action. Yes, he beats some of the bad guys, but he's hurt and bloodied a lot (and almost half-naked to say the least), and on the verge of giving up (he knows he's gonna die but he's afraid of it). These are the reasons why I loved this character. He's vulnerable but he's determined to his job especially when he has to save his wife. Films inspired by \"Die Hard\" are pretty entertaining in terms of action but they don't have the main character that we supposed to root for.",

        "content": "Holy shit man. These are some of the greatest movies I ever watched. \n\nThe first movie is good, but it is pretty boring I can\u2019t lie. It doesn\u2019t really get all that interesting until the montage and the final fight. But man, something about that fight made it all worth it. I can\u2019t describe it, just watching that iconic montage and fight made it feel like I didn\u2019t waste my time. \n\nFrom there the movies just kept on getting better. My favorite one has to be 4. And to be honest I didn\u2019t think 5 was that bad. It was enjoyable and had a good story, the only problem was since it was initially the last movie in the franchise, it would be a pretty bad way to end it. I\u2019m glad they gave Rocky\u2019s story a proper ending with Rocky Balboa (hate that name), which I also thought was a great movie. It had probably the most realistic fight in the whole franchise.\n\nI\u2019ve also just finished all the Rambo movies, and just finished the first Creed movie. All of this is to say that the Rocky movies kick ass and I\u2019m mad at myself for not watching them sooner. ",

It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a big movie, a video game, or even just a VW commercial, he gives it his all and is just a joy to watch! My favorite role of his is the Nihilist in The Big Lebowski, but he does have a hilarious role in an episode of Leverage where he is a German filmmaker making a documentary of a card company (in the style of The Office)!\n\nWhat roles of his do you like?",

        "content": "Brian De Palma has directed some of the most iconic films such as Carrie, Scarface, The Untouchables, and the first Mission Impossible. And yet he does not seem to be as talked about compared to the other New Hollywood filmmakers(Coppola and Scorsese for instance). He took advantage of the technical aspects of filmmaking such as using split screens and tracking shots in his films. However, from what I have read and seen, he seems to be a rather divisive figure in Hollywood. In addition to the surprising amount of Razzies he's been nominated for, many see him as style over substance and a major Hitchcock ripoff in many of his flicks. Others take issue to the gratuitous sex and violence as well. While I personally understand and enjoy some of his films, I am interested to learn what others opinions on him are?",

        "content": "Movies don't always strive for historical or scientific accuracy, but sometimes they do, only for new information to emerge later that changes the academic consensus and it turns out it wasn't actually accurate after all.\n\nFor example, back in the day, historians mostly accepted that the\u00a0Titanic\u00a0sank whole (some witnesses had insisted that it had split in two though, but it was dark and hard to see so their testimonies were considered unreliable). As such, movies used to depict it sinking in one piece. But in 1985, the wreckage of the Titanic was discovered and it was proven that the Titanic had split in two, and as such movies released afterwards, especially the\u00a0James Cameron\u00a0movie, have depicted sinking it accurately.\n\nThe public perception of dinosaurs mostly comes from what we've seen in movies, and a lot of it is because of\u00a0Jurassic Park\u00a0. The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park mostly looked like what scientists thought that dinosaurs looked like at the time. But in the decades since, it has been discovered that dinosaurs probably had feathers. Despite this, newer Jurassic Park movies still depict most dinosaurs as not having feathers, and so do most movies with dinosaurs really, it's just what audiences are used to at this point.\n\nSo what other depictions used to be considered accurate but later weren't due to new information?",

        "title": "Educating Rita is the most beautiful film about self-determination and friendship",
        "content": "So Educating Rita (1983) sees Blood Brothers author Willy Russel's updated take on the classic George Bernard Shaw play Pygmalion. He really subverts the narrative into something special and important. Michael Caine and Julie Walters are just phenomenal and arguably at their very best, as the middle class professor and his working class student, who also works as a hairdresser, in the 1980s. He is teaching her how to pass a literary course, with the narrative building up towards that final exam.\n\nThe three key themes I identified were self-determination, friendship, and social class dynamics. \n\nNow, Pygmalion is the classic tale of a working-class woman being educated and transformed into a member of upper class society by a wise professor.\n\nThe ending is quite dark, and it makes a point of how Eliza Doolittle feels she has lost her identity and it's exceedingly bleak. This was famously changed into a happy ending for the wonderful and far more famous musical My Fair Lady. Both have their charms , but I'll take the politically charged Pygmalion any day.\n\nNow, what I love about Pygmalion is Russel kind of flips the roles on a psychological level. Caine's professor character Frank is far more vulnerable than hard-nosed Rita. He struggles with alcohol addiction and Rita's transformation kind of breaks him. He can't stand losing her, what she was (his pet project), as he's so unhappy in his life, otherwise.\n\nThroughout the movie we see Rita taking more control over her life and doing what she wants instead of what society expects of her. She ditches the oppresive husband who wants a baby and breaks out of her shell to become a popular and highly regarded student at the university. She smashes the exam and gets a distinction. \n\nIn an absolute Tour de Force of a monologue, Rita explains why she decided to carry on down that path. She explains that she had 'a choice' and made it, after considering it. She then talks about all the potential she has now the exam is over and how she can choose to do pretty much anything she likes and doesn't feel held back like before. A complete 180 from the Rita we saw at the start.\n\nIn both characters, Russel is exploring the idea of self-determination. Frank makes every wrong decision and falls apart as the film progresses. And Rita seems to make every right one.\n\nThrough this journey, we also explore their friendship amid the backdrop of the middle and working class dynamics in 1980s Liverpool (you couldn't pick a better time or setting to explore this). \n\nThroughout the movie, you get a whiff of palpable romance but I think that's just because Walters and Caine's chemistry is just so good. At the very end, the characters look like they may kiss as they're about to embrace to say goodbye, but no, thankfully they give eachother a nice big hug.\n\nFrank takes a bold new step and transforms his life by jetting off to Australia. \n\nThen, in the final shot, Rita is walking off down the corridor. In an earlier scene, Frank implored Rita to come with him. Rita turns and looks back, you can tell she's thinking about going. But then she decides to carry on striding forward to make her own way in life. Just beautiful.",
