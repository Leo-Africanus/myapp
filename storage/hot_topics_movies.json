        "content": "Hi Reddit. I'm Eric Lin. I directed ROSEMEAD, which stars Lucy Liu, Lawrence Shou, Orion Lee, Jennifer Lim, Madison Hu, and James Chen. It opens nationwide and in Canada this weekend 1/9.\n\nROSEMEAD is the first feature I've directed though I've shot many films as a cinematographer. Some of those films include HEARTS BEAT LOUD, THE SOUND OF SILENCE, I SMILE BACK, EQUITY, and THE EXPLODING GIRL.\n\n**ROSEMEAD's synopsis:**\n\nInspired by the harrowing true story, Lucy Liu transforms in a riveting, career-redefining performance as an ailing woman who takes drastic measures to protect her troubled teenage son (Lawrence Shou). As his dark obsessions grow and time runs out, she is forced to make impossible choices: how far will she go and what is she willing to sacrifice? Set against the simmering tensions of a Chinese American community, ROSEMEAD is a gripping portrait of a family pushed to the edge.\n\n**Watch the trailer here:**\n\n[https://youtu.be/IwQy6jV1QCM?si=JZSyeLE4UX4KEhfD](https://youtu.be/IwQy6jV1QCM?si=JZSyeLE4UX4KEhfD)\n\nIt's a story about the desperate need for connection and it's a film that was meant to be seen and shared with other people. Please check it out in theaters this weekend.\n\nI'll be back on Tuesday 1/13 at 3pm ET / 12pm PT to chat.\n\nAsk me anything! Talk to you all on Tuesday.",

        "content": "The Fall Guy is available right now on Netflix, at least here in Sweden, so I watched it yesterday with my SO. We were not looking for it specifically, it was just shown on the home page, and we thought, why not? Our two small kids are asleep, it had been a long day, we were tired, it was late, so an easy-to-follow, action movie seemed like a good idea. When it finished we just looked at each other and we both said the exact same thing: 'it was much better than I had expected'.\n\nI had heard about the movie before, but it just looked like the typical action/comedy movie with two very well known faces to pull people into the cinema, so it didn't catch my attention. And in a way it was indeed an action-filled film with plenty of very funny moments, so even if it were just that it would had already fulfilled its duty. But it's also a love letter to stuntmen and women and their craft and skill, showing a lot of their work in front and behind the cameras in a realistic way (or at least that's what I thought as someone that has nothing to do with the cinema business). The choreographies are superbly done, for example the one at the club, when Ryan Gosling's character is under the influence. It also has some very neat scenes that would be worth of mention even in a more \"serious\" movie (I'm talking specifically about the split-screen specular shot of the phone-call; if you have seen the movie I'm sure you know which one I'm talking about).\n\nSo why don't I hear about it more often than I do? I think that it deserves more mentions than it gets.",

        "title": "Oliver Platt",
        "content": "Oliver Platt turns 66 today and I gotta say I've become a fan. He's not a particularly well-known or even highly acclaimed actor but he's always been the standout in everything he's been in. His screen presence is literally (he's 6 foot 3 and a large guy) and figuratively immense.\n\nI saw him for the first time in the movie 2012; that movie had John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Chiwetel Eijofor and Danny Glover but for some reason, he's literally the only actor I remember from that movie after 17 years; I looked up the wiki on it recently and was shocked at how many A listers were involved but it was only him that stood out to me. His role in X Men First Class was much much smaller and barely relevant to the plot, but over a decade since I last watched the movie I still remember him being in it, clear as day.\n\nHe also got me watching The Big C and I found it one of the best acted US series I've ever watched; maybe it's because it also starred Laura Linney and a host of other great actors and he was a pretty good foil to Laura's character. Most US series I've watched tend to have very dry acting but in this case it was like being in the room with a bunch of real life people and he was a huge part of that. Also I never watched a medical series before as I found them too boring and heavy but he got me watching clip after clip of Chicago Med too; I don't think I would have watched if not for him and if his character leaves I would likely drop it immediately since there is no other character so far I have connected with.\n\nI have only seen a fraction of his body of work over 3 decades but it seems a lot of people feel the same way about him no matter which of his work they watch. Particularly in The Three Musketeers they always quote his character and this was a film that also starred Charlie Sheen and Kiefer Sutherland who are way bigger household names than he is.\n\nHe's impressed me whatever his character's moral alignment is but a part of me kind of wishes he would play more snooty high society types; apparently he comes from a very old money background  so I don't think there's anyone more suited to play a rich snob than him lol.\n\nWhat are your thoughts about Oliver Platt?",

The HK film industry seems to have been in decline for the past 20 years.\n\nDo you notice there are no new generation HK stars that can compare with Andy Lau, Tony Leung? They all have that pasty white boy band look. Where is the next Chow Yun Fatt?",
