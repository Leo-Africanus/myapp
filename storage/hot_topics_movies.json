The final act really enhances the eerie and nightmarish feel, especially the fluctuations in time and perception, and pinbacker's apparent superhuman durability and determination from his mania. Real freaky stuff, makes you question our understanding of our universe, and whether something supernatural is at work or not.",

        "content": "Sexy Beast is an iconic English Gangster movie, beautifully filmed and has an excellent pace. At 84 minutes, it packs a nice concise punch, and leaves you wanting more. Starring Ray Winstone (Gal) and Ben Kingsley (Don Logan). \n\nIf you've not seen this film, then please do, it is incredible. The performance Ben Kingsley gives as Don Logan will leave you genuinely chilled to the bone. I sincerely do find Don more scary than Anton because Don Logan is the sort of psychotic you might have even experienced in life - he wears violence on his sleeve, he is unhinged, and needs to be in absolute control, but under the surface, you have this tormented soul who is anything but in control. When Gal tries to leave his life of crime behind him and just relax in Spain, Don is tasked with offering him a job to do, when Gal refuses, things get tense. \n\nThis film does not have masses of physical violence.. the violence is psychological, and it comes in spades in this film. I promise you that you will love this film - you might want sub titles because the cockney accents are strong with this one. Please watch it, and please enjoy.",

        "title": "Hear me out: Death Becomes Her is basically a dark comedy version of Sunset Boulevard",
        "content": "\nBoth films centre around aging actresses who refuse to accept that their youth and fame are long gone. Norma Desmond and Madeline Ashton are basically cut from the same cloth. They\u2019re both living in fantasy worlds, surrounded by reminders of their past glory, doing everything they can to pretend time hasn\u2019t touched them. Norma clings to old film reels and delusions of a comeback. Madeline drinks a potion and literally becomes immortal. Different tone, same fear, irrelevance.\n\nThey also share this intense jealousy when \u201ctheir\u201d man starts loving someone else. In Sunset Boulevard, it\u2019s Joe Gillis. In Death Becomes Her, it\u2019s Ernest. That jealousy builds until it tips over into madness and, eventually, murder. Both women go down with the ship, clutching their illusions of beauty and control.\n\nAnd here\u2019s a detail I\u2019ve always found weirdly perfect. When Norma first meets Joe, she mistakes him for a mortician. But in Death Becomes Her, Ernest actually is a mortician. He literally specializes in making the dead look alive. The symbolism is so on the nose it almost loops back around to genius.\n\nOf course, the tones are completely different. Sunset Boulevard is noir tragedy, Death Becomes Her is full-blown camp. But they\u2019re both sharp critiques of Hollywood\u2019s obsession with youth, beauty, and fame. One just plays it straight, the other goes off the rails in the best way possible.\n\nSo yeah. Sunset Boulevard walked so Death Becomes Her could teeter in wearing heels, half a spine, and a wildly inappropriate hat.\n\nAnyone else see the connection? Or am I just watching too many movies about dramatic, decaying divas?",

        "content": "There are many people that argue that a guy and a girl can\u2019t JUST be friends, especially if both parties are heterosexual. Because depending on how close they become, it is usually inevitable that they will become sexually and emotionally attracted to the other. \n\nHowever, I personally believe the opposite and that it is possible for a guy and a girl to be very close without there being any hints of romance. \n\nOne good example that I can think of is the friendship between Jess and Leslie from the Disney film; Bridge to Terabithia (2007)! Their friendship was the heart and overall story of the movie, and it was so heartwarming to watch that friendship develop before it took a devastating turn with Leslie\u2019s death. \n\nSure it could be argued that Jess was realizing that he was romantically falling in love with Leslie, and there were some hints of a romance sparking between them before she died. But it was still a great friendship, where there was a great deal of love between them without needing to become a couple. ",

        "content": "I have watched this probally around ten times by now and it still hasn't gotten old. \n\nThis is definitely my second favourite 80s movie right behind die hard. It is just so fun. I love how this is combines horror, sci-fi and action. I like Arnold in this movie especially the 'GET TO THE CHOPPA' line. \n\nI like the final fight between Arnold and the predator, I like the score, I like the design of the predator. I also like how this is kind of a slasher movie with the crew getting killed off one by one, it seperates it from other action movies. \n\nSo overall this movie is like a solid 10/10. \n\n(Also just a note in case people are getting confused between horror and scary. Childs play is horror because what else could it be, I don't find it scary.)",

        "title": "School of Rock - Most Iconic Quotes?",
        "content": "For a while I've been interested in why/how movie lines can stick in peoples' heads to the point that they become quoted in everyday conversations. While some films are \"quotation-dense\" like The Princess Bride (1987), Forrest Gump (1994), and The Terminator (1984), there are others which only have one or two lines which make it into the public consciousness.\n\nI re-watched Richard Linklater's 2003 film \"School of Rock\" recently and feel like it falls into the latter category.  While I've heard people say lines like \"You're not hardcore...unless you live hardcore!\" and \"Now raise your goblet of rock\" before, it's certainly not the most quoted film of all time (this might be because it was a cult classic and not a smash hit, but maybe you attribute this lack of blockbuster success to its low-quotability?).\n\nI'd like to use School of Rock as a case-study: What do you think is the most iconic line from the film, and more importantly, why do you think it gained \"quotable\" status?",

        "content": "I recently rewatched Interstellar and Arrival, and \u2014 they absolutely wrecked me in a way they never did before I became a parent. The emotional core of Interstellar \u2014 a dad separated from his daughter with time slipping away \u2014 and the heart-wrenching choices in Arrival hit so much deeper now.\n\nIt made me wonder: what are some other films that take on a whole new emotional weight and dimension after having kids? I'm especially curious about stories that explore the parent-child bond, sacrifice, fear, or hope through a new lens once you're on the other side of it.\n\nWhat movies have you rewatched as a parent that just destroyed you emotionally (in the best or worst ways)?",

I would\u2019ve loved for a solo Batman movie with more of that. Instead, we got the abysmal turd that surrounded it. \n\nWhat films come to mind for you guys?",
