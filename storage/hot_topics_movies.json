This means that anyone can make projects about these original books, including film adaptations. We've already seen non-Eon Productions Bond films in the past with Casino Royale 1967, and Never Say Never Again, but this will be a whole different ball game. \n\nThere are of course restrictions, like studios not being able to use anything made up for the movies, like the iconic opening gun barrel sequence. \n\nBut what do you think? With Eon notoriously prioritizing other projects like Othello over the highly anticipated Bond 26, could it be a good thing that other studios will get a crack at Bond? Or will it dilute the brand and ruin everything they've been building up since 1962?",

These days, I find that a lot of it is pretty \"meh\" for me. Last week I was catching up on a few movies that have been praised: I, Tonya, Everything Everywhere All at Once and Anatomy of a Fall. While I enjoyed them somewhat, I found none of them amazing. It rarely happens anymore that a movie amazes me. Everything feels a bit like I've seen it before. In fact, I get most enjoyment out of watching 90s movies, that feels like one big nostalgia trip for me.\n\nI wonder whether this is a normal process, that you end up liking the stuff you discovered as a kid best? Or maybe the introduction of streaming services has brought about a decline in movie quality?",

It was like an AI was told to write a movie for kids, but to write it as a 13 year old. I don\u2019t know. But it was so terribly written. To be expected. But is it possible Hollywood snuck in an AI script attributed to a person to see if they could get away with it? Hell the quality of this thing was so lazy, the screenwriter could have asked AI to mke it and just never told his boss. ",

If the movie is just 90 minutes long, an intermission would not make any sense. So only movies that are longer than 120 minutes (might) need one.\n\nBut what is your thoughts on it?

        "content": "I was fortunate enough to get IMAX 70MM tickets for a showing. Of Interstellar\u2019s re-release last weekend.\n\nObvious love for the visuals aside. One thing that I did not appreciate when I saw this film 10 years ago was the stakes and what was happening to the characters. Being that this was Nolan\u2019s first original film since Inception, I was focused a lot more on the visual spectacle, along with wondering if I could \u201csolve\u201d his movie like many tried to after Inception released.\n\nI can say after seeing the film this weekend that as incredible as the visuals are, the dialogue and score are even more incredible than I possibly remembered.\n\nI read that Zimmer was challenged by Nolan to pretty much create these original compositions, and this score mixed with the dialogue had me openly bawling like a baby in multiple scenes. \u201cStay/Coop leaving Murph\u201d in particular had me crying through the whole sequence. \n\nthere is something so powerful in that composition that just had me losing it. It might be the idea that I\u2019m becoming more open to becoming a father, but when the entire orchestral noise starts escalating as Coop is letting Tom have the truck, I am wailing for him to stay. \n\nAnd this was just for one of the compositions in this film. I can keep going on about how this element alone was truly amazing for a film like this. I really hope this gets an extended run so I can watch this again.",

        "content": "Recently watched The Hateful Eight for the 3rd time now and one of my favorite comedic bits of all time is everyone trying to hammer the door shut while getting into Minnie's haberdashery.\n\nIt just gets more and more chaotic and silly as the movie goes on. First Kurt Russell's character struggling to keep the door shut while being handcuffed to his prisoner and getting yelled at by random strangers. Then Walton Goggins character goes through the same thing 20 minutes later, the massive struggle of one board not being strong enough to hold, everyone staring at them judging and shouting to really nail it in. OB accidentally hits the wooden board instead of the nail and saying \"jesus christ, that door is a son of a whore\" as the wooden board breaks in two. Then 15 minutes later the mexican character hitting his head against the lamp while trying to nail the door for the third time now and we see how fucked up the door boards are because everybody keeps trying to really nail it in. \n\nOf course later on we learn why the door was broken in the first place but I really enjoy these small side bits to the main story that makes it feel more authentic. Are there any other movies with bits that get more ridiculous as the story goes on?",

        "content": "So I put Equalizer 3 on last night. I watched the two first movies some time ago and honestly can't remember much from them other than I kind of enjoyed Denzel using wits to make life miserable for some bad guys. Classic action stuff.\n\nThe third movie did not leave me with the same sense of joy. I mean, Denzel is always great, but it's quite slow for a third movie in an action series and apart from a few specific scenes it just doesn't have the intensity that I remember from the first two movies.\n\nSome ups and downs:\n+Denzel glooming\n+Nice to see Dakota Fanning in something again\n+Nice location\n-Boring villain\n-Slow pacing\n-Denzel is sitting at a table for 60% of the movie\n\nI came up with a way I think this movie got made: Denzel wanted to go on a vacation to Sicily, and the movie crew asked if they could pay his trip if they got to film him sitting at a few restaurants and do four short action sequences with him. He then negotiated that number down to three and this movie is the result.",

        "content": "Hello there,\n\nyesterday, I've asked you for your most favorite movie set in Sweden. Almost 100 comments later, I think, we've found a very interesting new entry for [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/): I mean, I've never seen it, but I will, because (apart from the fact that I will watch every movie on this list), c'mon, if I have been informed correctly, **Det Sjunde Inseglet** (engl.: *The Seventh Seal*) shows us Max von Sydow playing chess with the Death! To be honest, I doubt that the next winner will be able to top that...\n\n...but we can try. I'm following an alphabetical order here (yeah, yeah, I know, that England and Co are still missing, wait for it), and so, we now take a look at movies set in **Switzerland**. As always, there are only two rules in this game:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\n&gt;Day 45: Sweden - Det Sjunde Inseglet (engl.: The Seventh Seal)\n\n&gt;Day 44: Spain - El labertino del fauno (engl.: Pan's Labyrinth)\n\n&gt;Day 43: Slovenia - Moj ata, socialisti\u010dni kulak (engl.: My dad, the socialist kulak)\n\n&gt;Day 42: Slovakia - Obchod na Korze (engl.: The Shop on Main Street)\n\n&gt;Day 41: Serbia - Balkanski \u0161pijun (engl.: Balkan Spy)\n\n&gt;Day 40: San Marino - Lo Sconosciuto di San Marino (engl.: Unknown Men of San Marino)\n\n&gt;Day 39: Russia - \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0435\u0440 (engl.: Stalker)\n\n&gt;Day 38: Romania - 4 luni, 3 s\u0103pt\u0103m\u00e2ni \u0219i 2 zile (engl.: 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days)\n\n&gt;Day 37: Portugal - Capit\u00e3o Falc\u00e3o (engl.: The Portuguese Falcon)\n\n&gt;Day 36: Poland - Kr\u00f3tki film o zabijaniu (engl.: A Short Film About Killing)\n\n&gt;Day 35: Norway - Fl\u00e5klypa Grand Prix (engl.: Pinchcliffe Grand Prix)\n\n&gt;Day 34: North Macedonia - \u041d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u0431\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0448 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430 (engl.: You Won\u2019t Be Alone)\n\n&gt;Day 33: Netherlands - Zwartboek (engl.: Black Book)\n\n&gt;Day 32: Montenegro - Igla Ispod Praga (engl.: The Black Pin)\n\n&gt;Day 31: Monaco - La fille de Monaco (engl.: The Girl from Monaco)\n\n&gt;Day 30: Moldova - Carbon\n\n&gt;Day 29: Malta - Luzzu\n\n&gt;Day 28: Luxembourg - L\u00e4if a S\u00e9il (engl.: The Last Ashes)\n\n&gt;Day 27: Lithuania -Vaikai i\u0161 Amerikos vie\u0161bu\u010dio (engl.: The Children from the Hotel America)\n\n&gt;Day 26: Liechtenstein - Kinder der Berge\n\n&gt;Day 25: Latvia - Krimin\u0101l\u0101s ekselences fonds (engl.: The Foundation of Criminal Excellence)\n\n&gt;Day 24: Kosovo - Zgjoi (engl.: Hive)\n\n&gt;Day 23: Italy - Nuovo Cinema Paradiso (engl.: Cinema Paradiso)\n\n&gt;Day 22: Ireland - The Wind That Shakes the Barley\n\n&gt;Day 21: Iceland - Englar Alheimsins (engl.: Angels of the Universe)\n\n&gt;Day 20: Hungary - S\u00e1t\u00e1ntang\u00f3\n\n&gt;Day 19: Greece - \u039a\u03c5\u03bd\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 (engl.: Dogtooth)\n\n&gt;Day 18: Germany - Das Leben der Anderen (engl.: The Lives of Others)\n\n&gt;Day 17: Georgia - \u10ea\u10d8\u10e1\u10e4\u10d4\u10e0\u10d8 \u10db\u10d7\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8 \u10d0\u10dc\u10e3 \u10d3\u10d0\u10e3\u10ef\u10d4\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d4\u10da\u10d8 \u10d0\u10db\u10d1\u10d0\u10d5\u10d8 (engl.: Blue Mountains)\n\n&gt;Day 16: France - La Haine\n\n&gt;Day 15: Finland - Mies vailla menneisyytt\u00e4 (engl.: The Man Without a Past)\n\n&gt;Day 14: Estonia - Vehkleja (engl.: The Fencer)\n\n&gt;Day 13: Denmark - Jagten (engl.: The Hunt)\n\n&gt;Day 12: Czechia - Spalova\u010d mrtvol (engl.: The Cremator)\n\n&gt;Day 11: Cyprus - Smuggling Hendrix\n\n&gt;Day 10: Croatia - Kako je po\u010deo rat na mome otoku (engl.: How the War Started on My Island)\n\n&gt;Day 9: Bulgaria - \u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0435\u0441\u0438\u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0435\u0441\u0438 (engl.: Eastern Plays)\n\n&gt;Day 8: Bosnia and Herzegovina - Ni\u010dija zemlja (engl.: No Man's Land)\n\n&gt;Day 7: Belgium - In Bruges\n\n&gt;Day 6: Belarus - \u0418\u0434\u0438 \u0438 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438 (engl.: Come and See)\n\n&gt;Day 5: Azerbaijan - Yuxu (engl.: The Dream)\n\n&gt;Day 4: Austria - Funny Games\n\n&gt;Day 3: Armenia - \u0546\u057c\u0561\u0576 \u0563\u0578\u0582\u0575\u0576\u0568 (engl.: The Color of Pomegranates)\n\n&gt;Day 2: Andorra - El fred que crema (engl.: The Burning Cold)\n\n&gt;Day 1: Albania - Lulekuq\u00ebt mbi Mure (engl.: Red Poppies on Walls)",
