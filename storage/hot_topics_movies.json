        "content": "Most movies and media present Gotham as an everlasting hellhole filled with crime. Bruce/Batman is barely able to hold back the tide of crime and corruption, and is all that is to stop the city from eating itself. However, in the Nolanverse, Gotham DOES improve. Batman began picking out the mob/organized crime operations one by one, and if a seemingly omnipresent maybe even supernatural being begins beating the living shit out of you, you begin to reduce your scale of operations. The DA in Batman begins - who stood up to corruption(maybe owing to Bat-influence?), got killed along the way, and Falcone openly threatened the richest man in the world, but in The Dark Knight, with the league of shadows unable to manipulate the economic conditions, Gotham improved significantly. Scarecrow said that the Batman left no more competitors in the drug business, the mob was frequently hunted down and on it's last legs, the cops and judges begin to stand up to evil, up until the advent of the Joker (which was a desperation ploy by The Mob.) Even after the events of The Dark Knight, Gotham was able to flourish for 8 years, with Robin saying that pretty soon, they'll be hunting down overdue library books.  \nBatman DOES make a difference. The supervillains are not a by-product of Batman being there, but are actively put down by Batman.\n\nEdit : Word",

        "content": "Hey there. So I have recently done a post in this subreddit asking about movies that were ruined by studio interference and meddling.\nAnd I got a comment saying that the opposite isn't talked about enough.\nIt got me thinking what are some movies that were saved by studio interference/meddling.\nThe best examples I found of studio interference making a movie better were:\nPredator (1987) The Studio insisted that the movie did not have enough gun fight scenes. As a result, McTiernan added the scene where the team looses it shoot their guns off into the jungle in every direction.\n\nApocalypse Now (1979) The studio insisted that Francis Ford Coppola, reduce the run time by an hour. So he edited out a number of scenes. If you have ever seen Redux you know how good of an idea it was.\n\nThe Warriors (1979): The studio made Walter Hill remove the comic book panels that he had originally put in the movie. The director\u2019s cut reinstates the comic-book scenes that Hill wanted and they just don't work.\n\nAlien (1979) The studio (producers Walter Hill and David Giler) added in the character of Ash, which original co-writer Dan O\u2019Bannon felt was a completely unnecessary addition. If They Hadn\u2019t Stepped In: We wouldn\u2019t have had Ash, which means we potentially wouldn\u2019t have had the whole Weyland-Yutari conspiracy plot.\n\nSo with these examples out of the way, does anyone have any other examples of movies being saved like this?",

        "content": "Let me say that the theatrical version of Payback is leaps and bounds better than the director's cut. Especially the whole third act. \n\nI think what ruined the movie for me was just seeing behind the curtain, and seeing how movies are really made. I always envisioned that a movie started with an idea, then the writer and director make that idea into a movie. Oh, how naive was I. \n\nI know now that most movies are nothing like the original idea, or even the original plan when they start filming day one to the final day of editing. \n\nI guess seeing how someone could come in last minute, rewrite a whole third act, film it, re-edit it, add a gritty filter and some good music, and make a movie that I enjoy from whatever POS the movie was headed just ruined the movie magic for me. \n\nTrust me, I've learned my lesson. I rarely watch any \"Behind the scenes\" or dig too deep into the production of movies I enjoy. I don't want to know how the hot dogs are made, and I don't want to know how the movies are made. I will just enjoy the end product.",

        "title": "What makes Das Boot so darn good?",
        "content": "To me (and a lot of others of course) Das Boot is in the top 3 of whatever list you can think of. I rewatch it maybe every 3-5 years or so and every time I am blown away about that this movie from 1981 not feels old one bit in the technical department.\n\nExcept the exceptional direction, execution and cast, What makes it remarkable is that is not just \"another great war movie\" where you at some point, directly or indirectly will be fed with morals, and the movie will make sure that by the end of it, you will know the good guys from the bad ones. I don\u00b4t say it is necessarily a bad thing but I think it is much more difficult to make a ww2 movie that will not in the slightest give a hint of the moral shortcomings of the germans (or the japanese).\n\nThis is I think the core to what makes Das Boot a unicorn. It balances a really touchy subject so masterfully that no one can blame it for being either too political and pretentious, but it\u00b4s not lame and totally avoiding on the other side either. It just feels very real and honest.\n\nSo what is your take on Das Boot?",

        "title": "Brian De Palma's \"Raising Cain\" is a instant reminder of how brilliant John Lithgow is at playing psychos",
        "content": "The influences of Alfred Hitchcock are there as \"Raising Cain\" playis like Psycho meets Sybil. Lithgow plays respected Dr Carter Nix who happens to have multiple personalities, some of them being psychotic murderers. Lithgow plays each of these personas with a distinct sense of extreme emotion, be it shyness or weakness or playful sadism. His performance keeps changing it up whenever a persona takes over, at one point he assumes a female persona, and Lithgow always had a bit of feyness in his acting which perfectly allows him to convincingly add that extra layer. \n\nSupporting roles are fine, I liked Frances Sternhagen as an eccentric psychologist trying to get to Carter Nix. Lolita Davidovich wears beautiful dresses. Steven Bauer has a nude scene. And aging actress Gabrielle Carteris plays a teenager again, this time no glasses and trashy.",

Everything about it was amazing, but that final twist felt like a slap in the face. I couldn\u2019t believe they went that route.

        "content": "As the title suggests, Better Man is a far superior movie. Took risks, was a frank and self aware retelling, and made me appreciate someone I previously judged badly for being a twat. The music integrated incredibly well, to the point where the story built into the songs and I felt the plot transcend into the lyrics. The monkey \u201cbit\u201d works perfectly to support underlying message and somehow did not detract from visual. Not to mention his sober portrayal of himself as a self aggrandizing, selfish, drug addicted, and fame obsessed person. Did not try to make excuses for himself yet I came out a fan. \n\nComplete Unknown was ok and predictable. Better Man deserves the Oscar noms. \n\nLet\u2019s discuss! Main flaw in my argument could be Robbie is a more \u201cflawed\u201d person than Bob which drove the story in a way that suits my personal preferences\u2026",

        "content": "I don't mean defend in a \"so bad its good\" way i mean defend in a \"you're all misunderstanding this masterpiece\" kind of way.\n\nFor me its AVP Requiem.\n\nAnd i'll tell you why.\n\nYes, maybe the lighting was bad but i was watching it on my PC so i never experienced the theater viewing, but i think all of the characters were well characterized, their dynamics well explored. I've heard people complain that we never hear what the main character did to go to jail or why he was friends with the sherrif, but i honestly think there's nothing wrong with that, we don't need to know, the movie does a great job of simply showing that although this guy has a rough past, he very clearly has a very very long relationship with the sherrif, by him getting home from jail it shows him as being bold.\n\nThe predalien and the aliens in the movie were extremely intimidating, it seemed like all of the characters, except for Wolf, were completely powerless. The predalien looked awesome as well, so that's a plus.\n\nThe movie is also EXTREMELY ballsy in it's edginess, i can't think of many other cheesy action movies for mainstream audiences that kill children and has pregnant women die in horrific ways. Not to mention the attractive love interest being absolutely massacred? I can't think of a single one of the copy-cat summer blockbusters that did that.\n\nIt's one of my favorite Alien/Predator movies, maybe a tier below, well, Alien and Predator lol\n\nSo yeah, thats mine, whats yours?",
