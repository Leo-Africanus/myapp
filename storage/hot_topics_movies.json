For Fennell, it looks like a luxurious pose of unserious abandon. It\u2019s quasi-erotic, pseudo-romantic and then ersatz-sad, a club night of mock emotion.\n\n[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2026/02/09/wuthering-heights-2026-movie-review/88556199007/) \\- 3.5 / 4\n\n&gt;Emerald Fennell\u2019s take on the literary classic\u00a0isn\u2019t exactly a Valentine\u2019s Day pick-me-up. Yet it\u2019s awfully stunning to look at with all sorts of toxic obsession, forbidden lust and gothic sauciness.\n\n[RogerEbert](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/wuthering-heights-film-review-2026) \\- Tomris Laffy - 2 / 4\n\n&gt;It\u2019s hard to feel freely when you are constantly and loudly reminded by every aspect of the movie that you are supposed to feel things.\n\n[AVClub - Natalia Keoghan](https://www.avclub.com/wuthering-heights-review) \\- 'C-'\n\n&gt;Overlong and undersexed, Fennell\u2019s version of Wuthering Heights betrays her audience of edgelords and perverts. Even stranger, those who have fostered a distaste for the filmmaker\u2019s sensibility will similarly find themselves disappointed. It\u2019s one thing to make art that can be read as indulgent, ill-conceived, and tasteless\u2014it\u2019s another to turn around and make something that\u2019s just boring in comparison.\n\n[Slash Film - BJ Colangelo](https://www.slashfilm.com/2097045/wuthering-heights-2026-movie-review/) \\- 5 / 10\n\n&gt;This is not an adaptation of \"Wuthering Heights,\" but the result of what happens when you're playing an approximation \"Wuthering Heights\" without a full grasp on the material but all the money in the world to bring your questionable imagination to life.\n\n[Consequence - Liz Shannon Miller](https://consequence.net/2026/02/wuthering-heights-review-margot-robbie/) \\- 'A-'\n\n&gt;As soon as this project was announced, it was easy to assume that Fennell would show as much reverence for the classic text as she showed for the sanctity of a man\u2019s grave in *Saltburn*. Except she defies that assumption by making sure that although *\u201cWuthering Heights\u201d* remains a deliciously horny film, it does summon a certain degree of pure romance, especially in the few moments when its leads are able to see past their misunderstandings and actually connect. It\u2019s a movie about how ugly people can be to each other, but also about the beauty they\u2019re capable of \u2014 a message that, like the original text itself, remains timeless.\n\n[The Telegraph - Robbie Collins](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2026/02/09/margot-robbie-jacob-elordi-wuthering-heights/) \\- 5 / 5\n\n&gt;Style over substance? Not at all \u2013 it\u2019s more that Fennell understands that style can be substance when you do it right. Cathy and Heathcliff\u2019s passions vibrate through their dress, their surroundings, and everything else within reach, and you leave the cinema quivering on their own private frequency.\n\n[BBC - Caryn James](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20260209-wuthering-heights-review) \\- 4 / 5\n\n&gt;Emerald Fennell's Wuthering Heights is *not* very faithful to Emily Bronte's novel, but we knew that. The trailer alone evoked so much hand-wringing from Bront\u00eb purists that the film became divisive sight unseen. This Wuthering Heights *is* very true to Fennell, the director of the scathing revenge drama Promising Young Woman and the lush, bitter story of class and obsession, Saltburn.\n\n[Collider - Therese Lacson](https://collider.com/wuthering-heights-review-margot-robbie-jacob-elordi-emerald-fennell-emily-bronte/) \\- 2 / 10\n\n&gt;What makes the original Wuthering Heights so powerful is the dizzying story at its core. The Earnshaws and Lintons have a complicated family tree, and Heathcliff comes in like a wrecking ball to blow everything up. On one hand, we want to believe that Heathcliff can change from his wicked ways with enough love from Cathy, but on the other hand, his actions are so cruel that it feels like Bront\u00eb is pushing us to the very brink of what is acceptable before ultimately redeeming him in his final moments. Emily Bront\u00eb's novel is about characters who are hateful and pitiable but still full of enough charm and complexity that we are desperate to learn their full, messy tale. Emerald Fennell's film is merely telling a shallow story about two people overcoming all obstacles to fall in love \u2014 not necessarily awful on paper, but it's an adaptation that feels like a 14-year-old skimmed the book and jumped to her own conclusions without any true understanding of the novel.",

        "content": "What do we all think? There\u2019s definitely a spectrum of schemes in the Bond series, from the sensible to the absurd. \n\nI think \\*From Russia with Love\\*\u2019s Kronsteen has a fairly reasonable plan: Spectre wants a Soviet code-breaking machine and James Bond dead, they play British and Soviet intelligence against each other, have Bond steal the machine and stage his and his Russian accomplice\u2019s deaths. Classic spy stuff.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of silly schemes to choose from, like Drax\u2019s plan in \\*Moonraker\\* to create a genetically perfect human race on a space station\u2026 from a few dozen men and women \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nBut I think \\*License to Kill\\* takes the silly cake. The plan basically revolves around a cocaine smuggling operation. While giving a tour of his facilities to potential investors, he demonstrates his method for transporting thousands of kilos of cocaine completely undetectably: dissolve it in gasoline, truck it to the destination, and recover the cocaine by running the gas through a coffee filter. This is the plan. Just\u2026 wow.\n\nBut what do you think? Is there another movie with an even sillier plan?",

Recasting Bob turns the character into either a cartoon or a clich\u00e9. \n\nThe other obvious choice is \u2018Being John Malkovich\u2019. This one barely works because it\u2019s Malkovich. The entire conceptual joke collapses if the actor isn\u2019t instantly recognizable but still kind of mysterious.",
