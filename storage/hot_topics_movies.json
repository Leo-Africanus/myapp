        "content": "The last thing Andy says before Norton shows his true colors is (paraphrased) \u201cI\u2019ll never reveal anything, I\u2019m just as indictable as you for laundering that money\u201d. He\u2019s 100% right. If Norton just let Andy try to prove his innocence and get released, then Andy is a **free man, who will do anything to not go back to prison**, meaning he is 100% incentivized to keep Norton\u2019s secret. If Norton played his cards right, he may have even been able to convince, pay, or blackmail Andy into still working for him after he was freed.  \n\nBut instead, Norton kills Tommy, keeping Andy alive. This means Andy is **still in prison and has nothing to lose**. Even if Andy didn\u2019t pull off the miracle move, all he had to do was sneak one letter out of the prison to either the press or the DA or the governor about Norton\u2019s corruption and they\u2019d immediately open an investigation. Andy knows all the details so he could state in the letter \u201caccount number xxxx at bank ABC etc, bribed by highway contractor on 5/5/1965 etc\u201d. What Andy did at the end is the extreme case of what I\u2019m describing, but even without that, he had both the power and motive to bring down Norton now.  \n\nNorton brought down himself through greed, hubris, and evil, but most people don\u2019t also realize - stupidity - because his plan was destined to fail if he only thought about it.",

        "title": "Confusions and curiosities regarding Glengarry Glen Ross",
        "content": "I've been watching the movie- esp. favorite scenes- numerous times lately, and a lot of things have \"dawned\" on me (some of which, hopefully, are at least answerable via the play?).\n\n1. When trying desperately to get some good leads, Shelley says, to Williamson, \"Cold calling. It could be working for you! You wanna throw it away!\"  Is this implying that, when Shelley was 'good at sales', he was cold calling, as opposed to relying on leads?  But... if that's the case, why doesn't Shelley just go back to *cold calling* and say, \"Fuck John's leads\"??  Also... couldn't one, technically, refer to them contacting each \"weak\" lead first that, presumably, never expressed prior interest, as a \"cold call\", too?\n2. We know that John was purposely attempting to sabotage Levene's career with at least one weak lead (who knows how many others).  However... why go to all of that trouble, which could very-well \"backfire\" on you, as a manager, if shit goes really south (especially if Mitch and Murray find out you were intentionally giving salesmen bad leads, rather than just leads that \"might be bad\" but you didn't know for sure).  Who knows how many other leads that were bad he intentionally gave to other salesman as well... o.o\n3. At multiple points, it's implied that- for some weird reason- the \"way they get new leads\" (or, at least, better leads) is by \"paying the head office\"- I think?- via money generated from sales.  But... isn't this a weirdly-inefficient way to run a sales office?  Why don't Mitch and Murray just give them good leads from the start, and expect them to use their sales capability to close w/ more of a \"sure thing\", revenues-wise, for the head office??  I guess one could argue that giving \"more-mediocre leads\" gives the salesmen more of an incentive to \"work harder and prove themselves\", but... business-wise, I'm not sure it's a \"great strategy\"?\n4. At what point, perhaps, did Williamson \"start hating\" Levene to make him go to such lengths as sabotaging his career with weak leads?  Presumably Levene, for numerous years, had a good run, but... at some point it dried-up prior to the movie's beginning.  Why sabotage one of your best salesmen (for many years) just because, \"I don't like you\"?? B/c the head office \"might give me a bonus for getting rid of a 'bad worker' promptly\", or some shit (as John might have \"hoped\")?\n5. Why does Moss return to the scene of the crime not even 24 hours later, even if he didn't directly rob the place (albeit leaving shortly thereafter)??  Isn't that pretty-risky?  And why does Moss \"show indignation\" toward Roma at \"getting accused of\", presumably, robbing the place, when... he was the brains behind the operation?  Is this just a good coverup of his role, or does he truly feel no remorse/guilt? j/w\n6. Why did David Mamet think a cop interviewing each of the salesmen individually, all day, \\*at the office itself\\*, was remotely \"realistic\"?  Unless this was, like, a huge break-in of a Fortune 500 company, how likely would the cops have even been to do something like that? :p  And did the play have any \"dialogue\" of the implied \"discussions\" between the cop and each salesman, or are we to merely guess what was said?\n7. Who tf is \"Lemkin\"? Is he, like, the \"head of HR\" within Mitch and Murray/Premiere Properties?\n8. Why does PP/Mitch and Murray have the salesmen pretend to be \"the heads of other properties\", rather than just say they're \"with Premiere Properties\"? Is this intentional fraud, b/c MM know they're selling shitty land/\"investments\", possibly which they don't even own (like, what \"respectable firm\" would waste time \"buying up\" swampland in Florida to sell to others)??\n9. The existence of  Glengarry leads being \"good leads\" seems to imply that all/most other leads prior \\*were\\*, at best, middling or weak leads?  If that's the case, didn't that imply that M&amp;M \"suck\" at 'finding good leads' to give to their salesmen?  Why not just work a bit harder to 'buy/obtain good leads' you can, presumably, sell the properties for a higher price to, when closing?  Surely that'd result in an even-more-successful business??  Are M&amp;M just major con artists pretending to be \"super-successful execs\", or something (who have yet to be caught)?\n10. It's admitted, numerous times, that the bulk of the usual leads given to salesmen are \"old\" (months, if not a year or more).  But... why keep going after leads that \"Kept saying no\" for months on-end??  Why not just... get better leads?  Are Mitch &amp; Murray dumbfucks who \"don't know jack about sales\" but, nonetheless, hoped to have other people work for them, as \"good salesmen\", presumably in the hopes that it would \"get us rich fast\", by keeping the bulk of the sales money for themselves??\n11. Early in the film, Levene seems to imply that, back in the day, when he was selling like hotcakes, he could call-up Mitch and Murray, complain about Williamson, and Williamson would \"be gone before I get back from lunch.\"  Assuming this is true and not just a hypothetical or delusion from Levene, doesn't this imply that M&amp;M \"know\", deep down, how shitty John is??  Why keep him on, as manager of the office, if they themselves know how bad he is?  Out of sheer desperation b/c they \"don't have anyone else that could manage it\" (including 1 of the four salesmen?)? Nepotism, maybe??\n12. What's the deal w/ the 'casual racism' against Indians (seems very random)? lol.  Aren't Indian-Americans one of the highest-earning demographics (esp. within immigrant groups) in the country? With a lot of them, from what I hear, being, among other things, engineers, doctors, convenience store owners, cab drivers, STEM grads, etc.?\n13. Why does Moss imply that nurses are, presumably, \"one of the best\" demographics to sell to? Nurses...? I mean, yeah, they got steady employment, by virtue of working at a medical practice (esp. a big hospital), but... did nurses \"get paid a shit-ton of money\" in 1992, in the US, or something??  Wouldn't it behoove Graff to, rather, sell to doctors, if he wants, \"people with steady employment and loads of money\" that can afford his stuff?",

        "content": "I watched this one on YouTube for free with zero expectations and thought it was excellent. The trench itself feels claustrophobic and filthy. You can feel the pain of each soldier especially Daniel Craig who was the top performer IMO. The scene of him suffering in silence eating his wife's jam was probably my favorite part. \n\nIt's very indie and psychological. Even inside of the trench it feels like at any moment they could simply get overrun. The soldiers hear awful things happening outside of the wire and it's like nails on a chalkboard.\n\nI like that they chose to go with the ugly, non-cliche, unattractive ending. There's nothing glorious here, just death. The writing is brutally honest and doesn't hold back. \n\nI would recommend this movie to anyone with an interest in war films. I'm more of a WW2 guy but this movie in particular has quickly become a new favorite of mine. If you have the time or the means watch it for free on YouTube! You got nothing to lose. ",

        "title": "Burning (2018) is a wonderful movie. A hypnotic, moody slow-burn that refuses to provide any easy answers",
        "content": "You know it's funny, as I was watching Burning, I kept thinking to myself that something about the story feels very familiar. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve seen elements from it in other places before. It\u2019s only after I rolled credits and looked up some details on Wikipedia that it hit me \u2013 it\u2019s based on a story by Haruki Murakami, and I had completely missed that detail in the opening credits.\n\nIt seems so obvious in retrospect because Burning contains pretty much all of Murakami\u2019s classic tropes: a young, directionless man without much of a personality. A hot manic-pixie dream girl drawn to the protag for unknown reasons. A surreal, dreamlike atmosphere. A well. Shots of the protagonist running. And of course, a cat!\u00a0\n\nJokes aside, Burning is a pretty terrific movie, but it\u2019s also a pretty elusive one that isn\u2019t really eager to provide any easy answers. I suspect that it\u2019s probably going to leave a lot of people unsatisfied because of the way it plays coy with pretty much every aspect of its narrative but that\u2019s what I loved about it. It leaves a lot open to interpretation and lets you draw your own conclusions.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if mine are right or wrong, but I have a few thoughts. The concept of the \"Big Hunger\" seems to drive a lot of the narrative forward. All 3 of the characters found something within each other to fill that metaphorical gaping void. Haemi to have someone to trust and feel validated by. Jongsu to feel some kind of meaningful physical sensation to jolt him out of his life of drudgery. And Ben...I suppose he felt fulfillment by finding these lost and lonely girls and essentially using them as prizes to maintain the image of his cool, rich alpha male life? At least that's what I gathered from the trophies in his bathroom - he parades these beautiful women around until he gets bored and moves on to the next one.\n\nI'm still perplexed at Haemi's disappearance from the movie about 2/3 of the way through. I could be wrong, but I took it to mean that at that point, she had stopped mattering to both Jongsu and Ben. Ben was already moving on to the next girl after getting bored with Haemi, and Jongsu was more obsessed with Ben's lifestyle and personality than caring about Haemi as a person. There definitely seems to be some commentary about misogyny here as well. In addition to Ben's treatment of Haemi, Jongsu calling her a whore for dancing half-naked while high is pretty telling.\n\nAnd all the talk of burning and burning imagery - I took it as a symbol of rebirth and continuance. To move on from something, you have to burn it and destroy it. I'm not sure if Ben saying he burns greenhouses down every few months correlates with him finding a new \"trophy\" girl. And maybe Jongsu burned down Ben in his car to try and move on from his obsession of him.\n\nI'm sure you could spend a lot more time interpreting the movie but I'll leave that for the comments. Storytelling aside, it works really well as a pure vibe piece. It's so atmospheric and moody, and gets downright eerie and menacing at times. The cinematography is gorgeous as well with some unforgettable shots and sequences.\n\nThe performances are top notch as well. Steven Yeun is fantastic as Ben, and seeing him play this charismatic and sinister bad boy was a blast. The actors who play Jongsu and Haemi are damn good as well.\n\nI'm still thinking about the movie and it's really trying to say. Might need to watch it another time but would love to discuss it in the meantime.\n\n",

        "content": "I hope it's ok to post this here, I'm not trying to be inflammatory, as I don't really discuss the actual plot of the movie or the actors.\n\n I finally watched Schindler's List, and I just need to get this off my chest and have no one else to talk to about how I feel. \n\nI tend to stay away from movies that depict historical violence. I can sit through documentaries and educational content that contains NSFL footage and testimonies, I guess I can chalk it up to me just being sensitive and easily triggered.\n\nThe movie itself was an absolute masterpiece. That being said, I went through all three hours completely unphased. I didn't cry when I saw children being killed en mass. I didn't gasp when I saw the piles of dead bodies. At no point did I look away because the horror was too much to bear.\n\nI'm numb and desensitized. Not just because of what's happening in Gaza, The Congo, Sudan... but because I've seen how the current barbarity is a mere drop in the bucket compared to the collective atrocities we as a species inflicted on ourselves for centuries. Year after year; decade after decade; millennia after millennia. The weaponization of fear fuels hate and violence to serve the greed and desires of people with power over others. To me, it's everything everywhere all at once... if that makes any sense \n\nI will say that although I was unphased during the movie, I couldn't sleep a wink afterwards. My mind couldn't rest thinking of all the parallels between the holocaust, the history of indigenous people who were colonized or annihilated, state sanctioned violence against it's own citizens, and the reality of the daily unfathomable torment that people are experiencing today. \n\nI think part of what kept me up is the understanding that this unbridled horror is avoidable, but the people with the power to orchestrate these atrocities have decided it's in their best interest to have the masses believe there is/was no way to prevent the carnage.\n\nMy ultimate takeaway from the film is that:\n\n\"Those who can see beyond the shadows and lies of their culture will never be understood, let alone believed, by the masses.\"\n-Plato \n\nOne day, when the truth comes to light, everyone will be against (insert whatever mass-manufactured atrocity here). \n\nBy then, it will have been too late to save ourselves from the consequences of our collective inaction.\n\nI cannot begin to conceptualize the physical and psychological pain that the dead victims who lived through the previous and present tortuous times experienced, not even to speak of the survivors. Where does all of their pain go?",
