His first response is \"Where did you get those cloaks?!\" I thought this was a lame/lazy joke and didn't snicker at all. \n\nWhen I watched The Village and the monster is chasing Bryce Dallas Howard, my reaction while it was stalking her through the forest was, \"How can a monster die fabric such a bright red?!\" That bothered me more then the fact it had a cloak at all. I can suspend disbelief to think it threw on a tattered robe or something, but a well-made vivid red cloak had me scoffing. Suddenly the Simpsons joke clicked and was humorous to me. \n\nThat's all.

I didn\u2019t watch trailers and incorrectly assumed Conclave was a horror movie, which would be my type of thing.  \n\nI was not prepared for what I watched.   \nThe best word I could come up with:       \n\nGRIPPING.      \n\nThe theatre was 1/3 full at best, but I swear that not a single person left to use the washroom or gets refreshments in the first hour of the film.    The characters, the process, the intrigue pulled you in to such an extent that  there wasn\u2019t a moment to quickly step out that you might find in other movies.    \n\nThe movie challenged social and religious conventions.   It managed to have you suspect virtually every major character of skullduggery at some point in the film.        \n\nThe church and its warts were on display, from treatment of women to racism, regionalism, and modernity.        \n\nIt was the weaving of so many individual stories, the unknowns of a dead man\u2019s thoughts and intentions, the political intrigue\u2026.. all together drawing you in like so many strands of spider silk making it impossible to look away.         \n\nSo there it is.

Angels in the Outfield (Best most heartfelt kids sports movie)\n\n3. Back to the Future (It will be hilarious to show them a movie about the far off future of 2015)\n\n4. Just blanket all the Disney movies from the 90s (I miss 2d)\n\n5.  Independence Day (Gotta teach them how to be patriotic and not go quietly into the night)\n\n6. Die hard (They need to grow some hair on their chest too, a little action is a must)\n\n7. Star wars, original trilogy (Yeah its basic, but its also important to me)\n\n8. Singing in the Rain (Every kid loves \"Make 'em laugh\", no exceptions)\n\n9. Galaxy quest (the best Star trek movie lol)\n\n10. Iron Giant (\"I go. You stay. No following.\" tell me you didnt just tear up right now)\n\nWhat about yours?",

They\u2019re the first movies that felt like they touched my heart and soul in a while (if that makes sense). Are there any other movies out there similar to these two? I\u2019ll take any recommendations, I\u2019d love to find more gems like these 2. ",

        "content": "This film was an academy winner and a huge box office draw and did extremely well in rentals, but in the past 20 some years it's become more famous for how widely unavailable it is in the states.  It's a really heart warming sci fi drama with touches of comedy.  It was previously released on DVD and blu ray but they are both long out of print and have never been given another release, it's not even available for streaming.\n\nSome people believe it may have something to do with music clearance rights with the soundtrack but there is no definite answer as to why Disney and 20th Century Fox haven't given this gem a new release.

Honestly, I wasn\u2019t expecting much because a lot of new releases nowadays feel kind of corny. But this one completely surprised me. It made me laugh, and I didn\u2019t expect it to be this good! I was hooked from start to finish, especially with how the plot took unexpected twists that kept me on the edge of my seat. The way the real Santa Claus stepped up in the story gave me chills, it was like watching a Christmas John Wick.\n\nI\u2019m here to appreciate a fun movie, not a film class analysis but I\u2019d give it a solid 7 because I loved Santa Claus in this movie! Sure, it\u2019s violent (the title says it all), but it was so good and it made me laugh, so I had to write about it here. If you still haven\u2019t watched it, go check it out. I wish Santa was real and honestly, that version of Santa was super cool!",

        "content": "I haven\u2019t seen this movie since 2005 but just rewatched it and it blew my mind. Incredible performances, balanced surrealism, and insanely ahead of its time in my opinion. The \u201csilencio\u201d performance scene stands out to me. The emotions in this movie, the dream like states, the conspiratorial scenes; it all comes together in such a cohesive way. I\u2019m reminded of when they intro Betty, and she\u2019s overacting positivity to the degree of a 1940s American film, almost certainly deliberately. And then the cut to her grandparents smiling maniacally as they take a cab. David Lynch is almost like the Ween of movies, his films capture all genres. Like in Mulholland Drive, there\u2019s horror, drama, comedy, romance, suspense, mystery, and more. This film is an insane achievement for David Lynch in my opinion. ",

We had it on VHS and we absolutely loved it. \n\nIn particular there was a song in the movie called \"Barking up the Wrong Christmas Tree\". We would constantly sing this song, driving our parents crazy. \n\nSometime after we all moved out and became adults we lost this tradition and the VHS seems to have disappeared, probably thrown out with other old stuff by our parents when cleaning. \n\nI can't find a single reference to this movie online, I even looked for some kind of Marmaduke Christmas movie in case I had the name wrong but nothing seems to exist.\n\nDoes anyone remember this movie or have any info? I KNOW it was real but somehow got lost to time. Any info is appreciated.",
