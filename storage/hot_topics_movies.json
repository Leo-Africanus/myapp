The tragic ending lands so hard precisely because you've been emotionally invested in both men. There's no clean victory; whoever \"wins,\" something valuable is lost.\n\n",

        "content": "If you\u2019ve seen one, you\u2019ve seen them all. People wake up in a large cube-shaped room with no idea how they got there. The doors on the floor, walls and ceiling lead to other identical rooms, some of which have deadly traps in them.\n\nThe first one is the classic. Characters named after the prisons that reflect their personalities (Leaven, Worth, Quentin, etc.) explore the question of the responsibility of the individual as a cog in the machine of society and how one can become free. It\u2019s as though French philosopher Guy Debord had moved to Canada and wrote a screenplay based on his life\u2019s work while stoned; rather than shooting himself three years earlier like he actually did.\n\nCube 2: Hypercube tells the same story again but adds time-bending into the mix.\n\nCube Zero is the prequel which takes a Monsters Inc. type view of the people who work behind the scenes and manage the bizarre cube prison/experiment/thing.\n\nCube (2021) is the Japanese remake of the original that I just recently discovered. It\u2019s a pretty faithful copy of the first one, but the scenes that differ are incredible. No spoilers, but this is the only Cube movie to make me cry. See it if you can.",

Others I can think of are Sound of Music and Parasite. Ideally, older films are preferred!",

Adds so much to the suspense. And of course, so much scarier because it can be a very real situation. The antagonist is also extremely menacing.\n\nThis is a good pick for a double feature with Misery on movie night.",

No music, not even any moving camera movement, just pure dialouge and character development. Not even a plot to follow. Just life as it unfolded for multiple characters. Unbelievable how it grips you for 3 hours with zero gimmicks.",
