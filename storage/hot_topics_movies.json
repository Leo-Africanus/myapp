        "content": "Few movie scenes are as breathtaking as the now iconic \u201cleap of faith\u201d scene in Into the Spider-Verse. Watching Miles climb to the highest building, What\u2019s up Danger playing in the background and his own theme weaving in too. The  Leap of Faith scene tackles who Miles is from a visual storytelling point. It's the kind of scene that literally freezes time and watching this in the cinema, you could feel  collective gasp from the audience around you as he LEPT. \n\nAlso him \u2018falling\u2019 and then realising he\u2019s actually rising = Chef Kiss\n\nThis scene is often cited as the best scene in the entire movie and for a good reason. That scene has become one of cinema\u2019s most powerful visual metaphors and one I rewatch on YouTube as much as possible. \n\n\n",

Is it any movie or movies that you guys could suggest that can help me to make the performance more historically accurate? Movies in all languages are accepted so far there is English subtitles! It would also be a bonus if the movie is about a detective agency but if it only is a movie from 1910-1913 it is okay! Please also comment where to watch the movie! The performance is going to be in London too so good if the movie is in London to! Happy for all the help and thank you!",
