        "content": "Hi reddit! We're Steve Hudson (director/writer) and Guy Bass (author of the bestselling children's book) of STITCH HEAD, an animated feature about a forgotten creature living in a long-abandoned castle. It's now in theaters everywhere. Ask us anything!\n\nSTITCH HEAD tells the story of a small, forgotten creature awoken by a Mad Professor to (Almost-)Life. Terrified the suspicious townsfolk of the village below will form an Angry Mob and burn the Professor's Castle to the ground, Stitch Head desperately indoctrinates his fellow creations to NOT be monstrous. But then a clapped-out old Freak Show comes to town, and it\u2019s down-at-heel ringmaster promises Stitch Head the one thing he\u2019s always longed for\u2026. Love.\n\nIt's out in theaters everywhere via Briarcliff.\n\n**Here's the trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JrJtrGMrEw&amp;t=](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JrJtrGMrEw&amp;t=)\n\n\\---------------------------------------------\n\n**Steve's credits:**\n\n[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1362496/](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1362496/)\n\n**Guy's bio:**\n\nHi! I'm an award-winning author whose children's books series include Stitch Head, SCRAP, Skeleton Keys, Spynosaur and lots of books that don't begin with 'S' like Dinkin Dings, Anna Gain, Laura Norder and Noah Scape. In 2010 Dinkin Dings and the Frightening Things won the Blue Peter Award for Most Fun Book with Pictures.\n\nI have also written plays for both adults and children. I've previously been a theatre producer, illustrator, temp, gerbil whisperer and have acted my way out of several paper bags. I spent my childhood reading comics and hoping one day to become a superhero. I spend my adulthood in more or less the same way. I live in London with my wife and imaginary friends.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------\n\nAsk us anything! We'll be back at 3 PM ET today (Tuesday 11/4) to answer your questions",

        "title": "When did Male Characters being Ripped(regardless of genre) become a norm in movies.",
        "content": "So I just recently watched The Long Walk. And among many other things one thing I really appreciated about the movie was how average everyone looked.\nOutside of McVries and Stebbins most characters were super jacked or ripped with 6% Body fat. They were just average looking guys.\n\nAnd this raised a question in my mind. When exactly did it become a norm for leading men to be super jacked or ripped in films.\n\nI remember watching older films where the Leading Men were just average looking guys. Even in movies that had action in them.\n\nSean Connery's Bond had a fairly average build. Gene Hackman's Detective character in The French Connection looked like an average Middle Aged Guy.\nHarrison Ford's Deckard had an average man build too.\n\nBut today. If you see a horror movie the main Male character is going to be ripped.\n\nYou see a Sci Fi film the main Male character is going to be ripped.\n\nYou make a Detective movie, the main 40 year old Family man detective is going to be ripped as fuck.\n\nIf it's a teen he's going to be ripped. \n\nIf it's a doctor he's going to be ripped. \n\nIf it's a lawyer he's going to be ripped.\n\nSo when did this become a norm and why?\n\nI initially thought it might have started with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester stallone who brought the jacked look to the American Hero.\n\nBut even in the era of of Schwarzenegger and Stallone you had average guy Action heroes like Bruce Willis in Die Hard, Michael Beihn in Terminator and Ford in Witness and The Fugitive.\nLet alone in non action leading roles.\n\nSo I really am confounded as to when this trend properly started where any lead character regardless of the genre or role has to be ripped.

It\u2019s obvious that Andre sees through the \"used gun\" excuse and knows that Yuri can potentially be threatened or scared, but he can also control himself and push down his humanity for business. An absolute monster cannot be trusted, but a human who can ignore their humanity when it suits them is great for business.",

        "content": "I was just randomly thinking about this, it\u2019s a common refrain in storytelling of all sorts that you should ideally [\u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show,_don't_tell?wprov=sfti1), meaning to convey information and story using relatively little exposition. \n\nAnd there\u2019s generally good reason for that, exposition can bog a story down or feel like you\u2019re lecturing the audience or something. It can come across as unnatural, with for example two characters having a discussion and delivering information that both of them should already know and have no reason to bring up, except to inform the audience. That sort is very common. \n\nBut what are some good movies (or shows) that do the exact opposite: they do \u201ctell, don\u2019t show\u201d superbly well?\n\nMy pick is Unforgiven, where there is constant reference to William Munny\u2019s pitch-black past as an exceptionally violent and indiscriminate murderer, but we never actually see him doing any of it, in flashback or anything. You only get a very small taste, deliberately, at the end when he does his revenge and the old Munny returns. \n\nHis past is otherwise communicated almost entirely through lines said by both Munny and Little Bill, with the latter especially going into a rage about how Munny used to slaughter women and children. Which Munny openly admits with the famous line, \u201cI\u2019ve killed just about everything that walked or crawled at one point or another.\u201d\n\nBut outside of those lines, Munny\u2019s despondency and deep remorse throughout the entire movie and Bill\u2019s anger at his perceived hypocrisy are all you need to \u201cshow.\u201d You believe it completely.

The UK has rated it 15 for Strong Bloody Violence, language, brief sexual references and New Zealand have it down as R16 for Violence, Cruelty and Language.\n\nAlthough the MPA site and many others around the web don't show the official rating yet for The Running Man, when you bring up the films IMDB section for Parents Guide, it says it has been rated R for Strong Bloody Violence and Language throughout, and sexual references.",

When I asked who should play him he said Kevin Bacon or Ed Harris, and he would have worked in the loading dock at FedEx. He also mentioned Gary Sinise, seemingly not considering Forrest Gump...What is the most unhinged take on a film you've ever heard?\n",

Hell, Simmons' speech about \"find someone who thinks the sun shines out of your ass\" was Oscar worthy.\n\nThen there's \"We Were Soldiers.\"  Sam Elliot as the grizzled Master Sergeant was worth the price of admission, but so was Ryan Hurst as the green enlisted guy who got cut off with his team, and had to keep them alive long enough to be rescued.\n\nI know there are a lot of others, but was interested in what those films are for you all.",

And I didn\u2019t realise how much of my childhood vernacular was influenced by this single character.\n\n The music is good. The mythology is gorgeous and the fact that it is steeped in Australian nature is thrilling as an Australian. \n\nAlso like that the lead fairy isn\u2019t really interested in romance at all, as it\u2019s nice to watch a US kids movie from the 90s that isn\u2019t romance focused",
