        "content": "Never in my life have I watched a movie so tense and aggravating. It\u2019s incredible. But god damn, I\u2019m only an hour in and had to pause it and go for a walk. I haven\u2019t had a cigarette in 8 years but almost considered smoking again for a fleeting moment. For those who don\u2019t know it\u2019s a danish film about a nice man who gets accused of being a pedophile. \n\nI want to kill every character in this movie lol. Holy fucking leading questions. It\u2019s realistic and this shit can happen to anybody, which makes it so hard to watch. There\u2019s been several instances so far where I yell the screen. I\u2019m not usually one to get bothered by film but this is just too real, and too helpless of a situation. \n\nI would never normally pause a movie to make a rant post. It\u2019s an odd thing to do. But I had to get that out of my system if I\u2019m going to finish this rollercoaster ride to suburban hell. Fuck all these people. I get why they\u2019re handling everything so poorly, it\u2019s a hard thing to deal with. But fuck the cop and his leading ass questions, fuck Gerthe, and fuck the parents for convincing their daughter that she was abused even though she told them she made it all up. \n\nI\u2019m glad I don\u2019t work with kids. \n\nEdit: finished. What a ride. I was surprised to see a happy ending and then BANG. right back to fuck this whole town. Idk if I missed something but idk who the shooter was. Fuck him. \n\nEdit 2: this post may seem like a complaint. It is not. I love this movie and would recommend it to anyone who likes movies that make them feel something, even if it\u2019s a bad feeling. ",

        "content": "I\u2019m don't like how a lot film and TV constantly depict the lower or working class as hopeless, self-destructive, uneducated losers. Someone\u2019s poor, therefore their life must be a tragedy of abuse, neglect, addiction, and ignorance, not a condition of unfettered capitalism. And it\u2019s usually packaged as \u201cgritty realism\u201d or \u201cmelodrama with heart.\u201d It seems sympathetic, but they still treat poverty as a moral failure, like being poor automatically makes you broken. I listed some examples but removed them because I feel that would make this post dwindle into a debate about how wrong I am about them and that isn't my point.\n\nObviously movies like Norma Rae do a good job. Billy Elliot and The Full Monty are good examples of movies that do it right. And the original run of Roseanne (I know, I know and I haven't seen The Conners) is pretty perfect in its tone. David Lynch's The Straight Story just came to mind. I am trying to remember but I feel My Name Is Earl didn't punch down at its characters.\n\nI'd love some recommendations for other movies/shows that would fit.",

If you don't know, AMC shows off a new movie, that hasn't realesed yet, early and the audience won't know what it is. It's kept a secret and all you know about it going in is the rating and runtime. \n\nI say all this because Kelly Reichardt is not a general audience director. Her movies are very slow and methodical. Alot of scenes of nobody talking and just jazz music playing, which alot of people like. This is not a director who pleases the general audience. The day after the screenings, people have posted (on other socials) how boring the movie was. Rimming the director's usual style. \n\nNow, you could say \"Why hate on the director's style that she is know for?\" Thats the thing. No normal person knows Kelly Reichardt. To make an audience of regular joes go raw into one of her movies was not a good idea. I don\u2019t know why AMC chose this of all upcoming realeses.",

Also preferably a character who has selfish goals and not that great of a person who has this type of situation occur. It\u2019d be even more interesting if they were close to achieving their goal but then lose it all before it.",

        "content": "This question occurred to me while watching Ferris Bueller's Day Off, during the Twist &amp; Shout scene - whenever I hear a Beatles song in a movie, I always think \"man, that must've cost a fortune\", due to how notoriously expensive their music rights are.\n\nSame with Led Zeppelin, which I'm not sure if they're expensive, but rather don't allow their music to be used in movies very often. Jack Black had to make a video begging them for the rights to use Immigrant Song in School of Rock.\n\nTo expand the topic, another filmmaking aspect that is well known in the industry, but underappreciated by the general public is filming during golden hour and how incredibly difficult it is to pull off. Setting up all the equipment for such a short period of time means you have to be extremely well prepared beforehand.",

The only french actor I really recognized or knew about growin up is Jean Reno &amp; I read somewhere he\u2019s not even really french but spanish, lol. I\u2019m not even sure if he\u2019s regarded or as well known to French people as he is in America. So who are considered the all time greats in France? Like if you were to ask someone in France who is the greatest actor, what would the answer be for most people? Like in America some common answers would be Nicholson, Leo, Denzel, etc, etc. Thanks!",

        "content": "Several classic noir films have used the gorgeous building, The Bradbury, as a location with its five-story atrium with ornate ironwork, elevators, and staircases. This iconic Los Angeles building was used as a setting in The Unfaithful (1947), Shockproof (1949), DOA (1950), M (1951), and I, The Jury (1953).  Additionally, The Bradbury underwent marvelous art and production design to play a major role in Ridley Scott\u2019s neo-noir sci-fi landmark, Blade Runner. The use of the building helped the movie to earn an Oscar nomination for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration. The Bradbury served as the rundown location and \u201ctchotchke-filled\u201d apartment\u2014remember those wondrous biomechanical creations inside that walk about and speak with childlike voices\u2014of genetic designer J.F. Sebastian, where Deckard (Harrison Ford) battles the replicants Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) and Pris (Daryl Hannah). \n\nVisitors are free to check out and photograph the ground floor with views of the breathtaking atrium and skylight above, and the ironwork that was especially highlighted in those black/white noir classics. \n\nHere are some glorious stills from Blade Runner\u2019s Deckard entering The Bradbury and J.F.\u2019s apartment: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMGtmNCrQKM\n",
