And if they don't have a life outside the show, what is even the point, they would be throwing their lives for a show, what would be the reason, money? but if you are on set everyday how would they enjoy the money they are making. Idk it just seems so weird.\n\nI haven't seen the movie in a while, so maybe I don't remember, but if the movie doesn't explain this what do y'all think is the answer",

The last moments of the movie in particular are what I find brilliant. As Truman leaves the set, the movie comes to a close. We never get finality on what happens to him in the real world, and it\u2019s an amazing parallel to how the people watching the show are no longer under full observation of Truman himself. It\u2019s one of the best endings to a movie I\u2019ve ever seen, even if it is a cliffhanger.",

        "content": "The Graduate is often mistaken for being deeply ambiguous, but this opinion came from Mike Nichols\u2019 decision not to yell \u201ccut\u201d at the end of the final scene, allowing the characters to fade silent and stare at the camera to show uncertain expressions. This tonal shift feels profound, but it\u2019s more of an aesthetic flourish than a true narrative or thematic ambiguity. The story itself is quite clear: Benjamin rebels against a future he doesn\u2019t want, chases Elaine, and gets what he wants, and they laugh happily at each other when they board the bus. They look into the camera because they are looking into their future.\n\nOn the other hand, Rear Window is more genuinely ambiguous. While the murder is solved, the film raises unresolved ethical questions about voyeurism and whether Jeff's decisions are ethical or not. Was he a hero for stepping in and helping others solve a problem or was he stepping into peoples' boundaries?",

        "content": "Far too often supporting characters are treated as little more than fodder. It seems many film writers strive to kill off supporting characters that are not integral to the plot. But that also means it is easy to spot the characters that have plot armor. I am always pleasantly surprised when characters survive in a film that I did not expect. Kudos to these writers, and I hope to create a type of list. Spoilers obviously.\n\nFirst some examples. \n\nThe Star Wars trilogy- As a kid I thought Boba Fett was the coolest, but I loved the Xwing fights so I got attached to the pilot named Wedge. I was pleased when he survived.\n\nAliens- Great storytelling. Did anyone on first view expect Hicks and Bishop to survive? Hicks doesn\u2019t have any prominent screen time in the beginning. As the film went on, I got more attached to Hicks, Hudson and Vasquez and was happy when at least one of them survived. \n\nStargate- some interchangeable grunts survive the film in addition to the main characters. \n\nMad max beyond Thunderdome- Pig Killer\n\nI was actually watching Stargate today and thought this. These are just a few off the top of my head. I hope other people appreciate when writers do this as much as I do. I\u2019m to the point where I expect nearly everyone to die in certain films and have begun to roll my eyes when it becomes predictable.",

        "content": "This film goes above and beyond other tragedies, somehow. Even \u2018Mystic River,\u2019 a strong contender for the most soul-crushing film ever, pales in comparison. \n\nThere\u2019s something about the sheer authenticity of Manchester that, going into it, you know you\u2019re volunteering to have your heart torn out of your chest, but you still can\u2019t help yourself because this is an amazing, beautiful movie. \n\nI have to watch it by myself because I need comfort breaks if that makes sense. I can\u2019t watch the full two hours, gotta cuddle my cats and watch YouTube chefs in between, because otherwise it\u2019s too much. That heavy feeling that settles into your chest, where you get the sense you\u2019re watching somebody\u2019s real life fall apart, that\u2019s how goddamn good these performances are. \n\nThey pull no punches at all. They make sure you feel everything. \n\nI can\u2019t say enough about this movie, it\u2019s so good. I don\u2019t know that I want to recommend it, due to the sheer emotional kick in the nuts, but on the other hand it\u2019s a masterpiece so yeah, if you haven\u2019t seen it, do yourself the dubious favor and do it. \n\nEdit - thank you for the soul-destroying suggestions. This is gonna be a fun weekend. ",

        "content": "Im super intrigued by the trailer. It uses kind of a cutesy art style and has that standard kid movie humor, but there\u2019s definitely a sinister undercurrent. Seth Rogen has never really played a villain to my knowledge, and while a lot of people pointed out that it\u2019s a weird casting choice, I think it could be super smart overall. People are so used to him as a goofy good guy that it would be extra crazy to see Napoleon become the tyrant of the farm.\n\nSince it\u2019s directed by Andy Serkis, I have a hard time believing he would make the movie more sanitized. Even with the jokes at the end, there\u2019s a very sinister undercurrent to the scene, especially with the music. Napoleon saying \u201cpigs should stick with pigs\u201d definitely foreshadows his cruel intentions",

        "content": "Apologies if this question was asked, I don't know how to search for it.\n\nObjectively, yeah they're some master classes in filmmaking. S grade on everything: cinematography, acting, music, writing, directing, nothing more to be said, they're masterpieces of film.\n\nTheir statuses are well-deserved but I feel like it puts people nowadays off, makes everyone who hasn't seen them speculate about what makes them the GOAT. Maybe they think they're some boring art films, maybe they're highly nuanced and complex movies they're too tasteless and film-illiterate to \"get\", maybe they'll watch other movies before they could be cinema-literate enough to see why The Godfather Parts I and II are considered the greatest. At worst, they're the movies of people who are like \"I have good taste in film\". Then maybe they actually do watch but they either over-analyze and overthink everything on their first watch or they think nothing exciting really happens in this so-called Greatest Of All Time.\n\nI'd much rather not call these movies the greatest; rather I prefer to call them \"essential viewing for anybody who likes watching movies\" and even then, I think of them more like Rorschach tests. Perhaps they'll like it, perhaps not, perhaps it sticks with them, perhaps they'll forget it as soon as the credits stop rolling. What I think is essential is that if they like watching movies, The Godfather films should be among them, at least just once just to have an opinion on them.\n\nBut IMO they're really best watched just as another movie without titles like Essential or Greatest Of All Time. Maybe you're in the mood for a crime movie? Or you feel like watching a 70s movie or period piece? Or maybe you like Al Pacino? Or it's just a rainy Sunday with nothing else to do? I think that's the best way to watch The Godfather, as long as it's not just background noise while you do something else (and even then, you might catch a glimpse and be engrossed enough to stop what you're doing and watch!) because they're not revolutionary mindblowing pieces of art enjoyed only by the most cerebral; they're just really well-made movies. Watch and see if you like them or not. The dissection and analysis can come later or not at all.",

Personally I thought it was good enough to not flop the way that it is, but I also think the movie suffered from the way it was marketed as being a team up between Jackie Chan and Daniel LaRusso to teach Ben Wang. I mean, that does happen, don't get me wrong, but it takes a LONG time to get there, because they spend the first half of the movie setting up the actual conflict. The daughter and Joshua Jackson seem to have much more screentime than Jackie Chan does; just saying.\n\nI think if it had been a bit more honest about what the movie was actually going to be, it would be doing better.",
