The necklace was far too recognizable. Had she tried to sell it, the insurance company that settled the claim would have recovered it, assuming that the insurance company was still in business.\n\n============\n\nEDIT: Regarding the points above, from the script:\n\nLOVETT: I tracked it down through insurance  records... an old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?\n\nROSE: Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.\n\nLOVETT: Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace his son Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee... you... a week before he sailed on Titanic. And the claim was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship. See the date?\n\nLIZZY: April 14, 1912.\n\nLOVETT: If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank. And that makes you my new best friend.",

What movie comes to mind for you?\n\nA big one for me is Batman &amp; Robin. As a gay kid in 1997 this movie was everything to me. The camp, the excess, the stupid puns, Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze, the bat nipples, all of it! The movie was widely hated, mocked by its own star, and plans were scrapped for Schumacher\u2019s next Batman movie. The Adam West-ish tone didn\u2019t fly at all in 1997, and resulted in the deeply serious Batman films we still get today. \n\nAlmost 30 years later, I see so much love for this movie all over social media. People seem to have embraced it for the campy, ridiculous good time that it is. Maybe they were kids like I was at the time and we\u2019ve reclaimed it as our own. It\u2019s interesting to see how opinions shift over time. ",

Years later they hit much harder, not because the movies changed, but because we did. Themes like missed chances, quiet compromises, drifting friendships, and the realization that our days are numbered start to feel louder. These films aren\u2019t openly about aging or adulthood, but they carry more weight as you bring more life experience to them.\n\nA few that grew on me over time are \u2018In the Bedroom\u2019(2001)which shifts from a quiet mood piece into something far more painful about loneliness, timing, revenge, and how ordinary people process grief. It\u2019s devastating to watch now because it understands adulthood, marriage, compromise, and pent up suffering in a way my younger self missed. The Graduate(1967)which starts to feel less like a rebellion story and more like a portrait of quiet panic when adulthood begins to feel like a trap for Ben. And \u2018Manchester by the Sea\u2019(2016)which hits different once you understand that some things don\u2019t get resolved, they just get carried.\n\nWhat are some movies you didn\u2019t fully connect with at first, but that feel completely different watching later in life?",

With *Hamnet*, she reminded me how much of a master she is at her craft, but *Eternals* is always going to be there...\n\nAlso happened to David Lynch and his *Dune*, the anomaly. Ang Lee's *Hulk*, George Miller's *Happy Feet/Babe*, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's *A Little Princess*...\n\nThen you have John Ford's *The Quiet Man*, Kurosawa's *The Idiot*, Howard Hawks' *Land of the Pharaohs*...\n\nThere are good movies, bad movies, good tries...
