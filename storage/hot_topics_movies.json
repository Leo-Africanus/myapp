        "content": "Hi reddit! I'm Mercedes Bryce Morgan, director of the new erotic horror-thriller BONE LAKE. It's out in theaters nationwide on October 3rd. It's about a dream getaway that spirals into a nightmare of sex, lies, manipulation, and a fight for survival. Ask me anything!\n\n**Synopsis:**\n\nA couple's vacation at a secluded estate is upended when they're forced to share the mansion with a mysterious couple. A dream getaway spirals into a nightmarish maze of sex, lies, and manipulation, triggering a battle for survival.\n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQy7BuW-R6c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQy7BuW-R6c)\n\nIt stars Maddie Hasson, Marco Pigossi, Alex Roe, Andra Nechita, Clayton Spencer, and Eliane Reis. It's in theaters nationwide October 3, 2025\n\n**More information:**\n\n* Rating - R\n* Runtime - 94 Minutes\n* Official Selection of Fantastic Fest 2024\n\n**Director's Statement:**\n\n&gt;When I first came on to direct \"Bone Lake\", the initial allure for me was its duality; on one hand, it offers the thrill and escapism that's characteristic of a \"popcorn movie\", and on the other, it champions an underrepresented narrative about modern relationships. Delving deeper, this film dances on the line of our complex cinematic cravings: we're drawn to the intoxicating pull of gratuitous sex and visceral violence, yet we simultaneously yearn for a tale anchored in emotions, trust, and genuine partnership. The film doesn't trumpet its progressiveness, but for the discerning eye, there are subtle nuances in the portrayal of gender roles and relationships. Like a serene lake that hides unexpected depths beneath its calm surface, \"Bone Lake\" takes a joyful, entertaining veneer and uses it to navigate the fluidity of gender, and the paradox of our desires. I wanted this film not just to entertain, but to resonate \u2013 to serve as both a mirror and a beacon for the way relationships can and are being redefined in our time. Through its thrilling narrative highs and emotional troughs, \"Bone Lake\" bridges the gap between the familiar and the groundbreaking, inviting audiences to revel in its excitement and reflect on its profound implications.\n\nAsk me anything! I'll be back later today Wednesday 10/1 at 3 PM ET to answer your questions.",

        "content": "As anticipation grows for the final season of \u201cStranger Things,\u201d star Finn Wolfhard has lined up another project that takes him back to the \u201980s.\n\nThe \u201cIt\u201d and \u201cGhostbusters\u201d leading man is teaming with his father, Eric Wolfhard, and producer Rich Peete to bring Bob Mehr\u2019s acclaimed biography \u201cTrouble Boys: The True Story of the Replacements\u201d to the big screen.\n\nThe father and son will co-write the screenplay, with Peete producing \u201cTrouble Boys\u201d under his Neighborhood Watch banner. Peete recently collaborated with the CAA-repped Finn Wolfhard on A24\u2019s \u201cThe Legend of Ochi,\u201d which made its world premiere at Sundance earlier this year.\n\nPublished in 2016, \u201cTrouble Boys\u201d is widely regarded as the definitive chronicle of The Replacements, the legendary Minneapolis punk band known for shaping American alternative rock. While the band\u2019s influence was undeniable, having paved the way for \u201990s stadium-fillers Nirvana and Green Day, original members Paul Westerberg, Bob Stinson, Tommy Stinson and Chris Mars often were are at the center of drama. Lorne Michaels banned them from ever returning to \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d following a self-sabotaging profanity-laced performance in 1986 that signaled the band\u2019s coming downfall. (Westerberg did return to \u201cSNL\u201d as a solo artist in 1993.)\n\nWritten by Bob Mehr, a veteran music critic and Grammy-winning essayist, \u201cTrouble Boys\u201d became a New York Times bestseller and earned book-of-the-year honors from NPR and Rolling Stone.\n\nThe project marks another move behind the camera for Finn Wolfhard, who recently co-directed, co-wrote and co-produced the Neon horror film \u201cHell of a Summer\u201d alongside Billy Bryk. At the same time, he has made serious inroads in the music space and is currently on his first solo tour tied to his debut album \u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d The fifth and final season of \u201cStranger Things\u201d launches on Netflix on Nov. 26 and will roll out incrementally rather than binge-style, wrapping up on New Year\u2019s Eve. \n\nIn a recent Variety cover story, the multi-hyphenate talked about working with his father on a secret music-themed project at their home in Vancouver. \u201cI\u2019ve been writing a lot of music and writing this movie with my dad, which has been really amazing,\u201d Wolfhard said of how he had spent his time since production wrapped on \u201cStranger Things\u201d in December. \u201cIt\u2019s about a band that I think weirdly I have a lot in common with, a lot of the members. I can\u2019t really talk about the actual band because I don\u2019t have the rights officially yet.\u201d\n",

        "title": "I tried making a map of every movie theater in the world",
        "content": "https://www.locatecinemas.com/\n\nI made a website that shows 30k+ movie theaters (cinemas) around the world on a single map, taking data from different showtime listings and movie theater websites. I tried getting as many theaters as possible. I didn't get all but I think I got most.\n\nSome things I found: \n\n- Many movie theaters, especially in developing countries, are inside malls. Malls might be dying in America but they are loving them abroad. \n\n- I found the most theaters for China, more than any other country in the world. Over 12k at this point. \n\n- Lots of theaters in remote areas, including islands or really northern parts of Scandinavia or Russia.\n\nSome people may compare this to CinemaTreasures and I love CinemaTreasures and have been a contributor there for years. It's maybe my favorite website. But their strong suite is historic and domestic (U.S.) theaters. For example, for China they have fewer than 200 theaters right now and it is an arduous process to add individual locations there. Even GoogleMaps is missing many China locations (and for the U.S. it often gives places that are not movie theaters when you search movie theaters). So I hope this can be like a companion, more of a way to just see all theaters on a map.  The goal is also that this can help someone find a movie theater no matter where they are in the world. \n\nThere are ways to search for locations, filter by country or draw custom borders to see all the theaters there.\n\nI am still missing some locations and there may be duplicates or wrong coordinates on the map. If you find any errors or missing theaters, please let me know. I know for a fact I am missing theaters, particularly in India and North Africa so I would be grateful if people could identify them. \n\n(This is just a non-monetized side-project. Not intended to be self-promotion, just sharing the project in case it can be useful to people.)",
