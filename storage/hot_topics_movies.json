This is literally the first time I'm hearing about this.\" And it's true; prior to today, I hadn't seen a single advertisement for it anywhere. In fact, this is something I'm seeing more frequently nowadays; I'll hear about a movie that just came out in theaters that I didn't even know was coming out.\n\nIt was way different back in the '90s when I was a kid. I pretty much knew EVERY movie that was coming out and when it was coming out because I would see tons of ads on TV and in the paper in the months leading up to its release. This was especially true for Disney; when \"The Lion King\" came out in 1994, you literally couldn't go ANYWHERE without seeing it advertised. If you turned on the radio, there was Elton John singing \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight.\" If you went to Toys 'R' Us, there would be Lion King toys EVERYWHERE. If you wanted to get a chocolate bar, there you'd find a special Lion King Nestle bar (I can still taste them).\n\nFast forward to 2025 and I find out there's a new Disney movie through an Alex Meyers video. Literally no advertisement or buzz leading up to its release.\n\nSo what's going on here? Did the streaming age and/or COVID change the way studios advertise upcoming movies? Or do algorithms only show us ads for movies they think we want to see?",

Had blockbuster and Netflix subscriptions simultaneously for back catalogue stuff. Dove into films as a way to one up people because I was so much better. Fell in love with my wife during a late night game of 6 degrees where we would both name a random actor/ress and the fastest to connect movies between the two the winner. Told my wife I loved her on Oscar night 2004. Trailed off watching films as the young kids came. Owned thousands of DVDs and bluerays, had to sell nearly all of them over the years during lean times. Some of them still hurt, others were easy to let go of. Stoped being a douche, or at least that flavor of douche. Got into fantasy books instead of films and haven't seen much recently - not to say nothing. Still a bit of a film snob. Given my description of myself, and not a single actual film Ive seen, recommend me the best film I've never seen. Bonus points if it's accessible to stream.",

The last sword fight has a guy in tighs and a cape, check.\n\nI clearly have seen tons of stuff built off this movie.  Kind of neet that I haven't seen it before now, it is a high quality classic.

Driving through the rough neighborhood and having the hubcaps stolen?  Stopping off at the saloon in Dodge City and Clark getting \"shot\" by the bartender?  The motel with the vibrating bed?  None of those stick with me at all.\n\nWhat are some other movies that are solidly in the cultural zeitgeist, but have one or more completely forgettable scenes?",

Ones that you remember not for being funny, but ones where you remember and they make you think. Maybe they make you approach life differently, maybe when you're on hard (or good) times and you remember it and it helps keep you grounded. Not just funny lines or good one-liners. I want some ones that will stick with me through life.\n\nMy two current favorites ones are:\n\n\"In an insane world, it is the sane that are considered crazy.\" - Lumalee, SMB Movie\n\n\"If you want to get out of the hole, first you have to put down the shovel.\" - Rick, The Incredibles 2",
