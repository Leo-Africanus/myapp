        "content": "\\*\\*\\*Spoilers ahead but it is over 30 years old movie..... sooooo how upset can you get?\\*\\*\\*\n\nWas re-watching Toy Soldiers (1991) and it's about a boarding school taken over by terrorists.  The terrorists make a rule where they do a headcount of the kids and teachers every hour on the hour and for every kid missing they will execute 5 others.  So Sean Astin character sneaks out to hand US Army people intel of all the terrorists but is delayed getting back.  And here is the stupid part... To try and fake out the headcount to make it seem like everyone is there, one of the more prominent characters tries to get his head counted twice by sneaking up the line.  The guy that tries to do it = the biggest blackest kid in school made up of mostly white kids and like maybe 2 other black kids that are quite small AND don't wear glasses!!!  If you are trying to fake out the terrorists like this... don't choose the one guy that stands out a lot and will be easily remembered.\n\nWhat stupid things have you seen in a movie?  Scenes or moves by characters that make you genuinely scratch your head....  And I don't wanna read any comment about running away from a T-Rex in high heels!",

Though you can predict a few things such as the pregnant lady\u2019s husband sacrificing himself and the little girl surviving till the end, you still are waiting for what\u2019s next. \n\nAbsolutely brilliant redemption of the father\u2019s character. And I believe him killing that selfish lad towards the end on the moving train by renouncing himself was an incredible way of how he grew as a human, and more so as a father. He was the only one who had a smile knowing that he was dying and peacefully surrendered. A phenomal tribute towards his daughter and fatherhood.",

        "content": "Theater owners are always saying they want more content than studios are sending out these days right?\u00a0\u00a0 You see re-releases like Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Interstellar, Titanic (I acknowledge these are all BIG movies) \u00a0making headlines for how successful re-releases of them are financially.\u00a0\u00a0 The fracturing of monoculture and the deprioritizing of going to the theater have obviously affected the industry, but just based on personal observation I know a lot of people who would be thrilled to go see popular, zeitgeist-y films from the past 25 years (and further back for many) on the big screen/IMAX if given the opportunity.\n\n\u00a0I get that there is still cost to doing this. You have to market it at least a bit, getting the films back out to the theaters and them agreeing to show it, etc.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But are the financials of doing stuff like this not an appealing opportunity compared to what they spend on making &amp; marketing new films?\n\n\u00a0This thought was brought on by it being the 10 year anniversary of Mad Max: Fury Road and it getting basically no re-release, let alone a brief IMAX return.",

Stand by me in my eyes is truly a masterpiece the writing, the acting, the sound track, the vibe. i was born in 2003 and stand by me gives me nostalgia like i lived in the 50s haha, a beautiful film with a Perfect Song (stand by me). and puss in boots the last wish is just Goated, one of the best animated films of the past decade imo.",
