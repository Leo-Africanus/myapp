Weird-looking and not handsome, I think it's actually one of my favorite Johnny Depp roles. His weirdness actually seems more authentic when he's a weird looking character. \n\nAnd a great ensemble cast as well, with stars like Ned Beatty, Bill Nighy etc, but also some truly fantastic \"voice actor\" performances.\n\nThis was so much better than I expected, from top to bottom, highly recommend.",

        "content": "*Anaconda* showed up in my suggestions on Hulu, and I watched it for the very first time. I could not stop giggling throughout the film. The transition scenes from one plot point to the next are hilariously bad; I've rarely seen worse continuity editing. The film is peppered with prolonged scenes where the camera is just focusing on the scenery and nothing else is happening. Jon Voight's character is an absolute wordsmith who provides a misspoken English sentence in almost every line of dialogue. Voight's incomprehensible accent is just one of several in the film, and their delightful dialog is only enhanced by the characters abruptly changing their mood throughout the film--like when Denise is balling her eyes out, abruptly loses every ounce of sadness to accuse Jon Voight of hatching villainous schemes, and then goes back to crying. The fact that Ice Cube and JLo are just part of the cast like it's nbd is so fabulously iconic \u2b50 \n\nAnyway, that's all I wanted to say. The film is so bad that it's good, and it effectively elevates bad filmmaking decisions to an art form. How do you feel about *Anaconda*? ",

        "title": "Spike Lee's 'Highest 2 Lowest' - Review Thread",
        "content": "*A music mogul faces a life-and-death moral dilemma when he gets caught up in a ransom plot.*\n\nCast: Denzel Washington, A$AP Rocky, Jeffrey Wright\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [90%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/highest_2_lowest)\n\n**Metacritic:** [75/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/highest-2-lowest/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[DEADLINE - Pete Hammond](https://deadline.com/2025/05/highest-2-lowest-review-denzel-washington-aap-rocky-spike-lees-music-industry-crime-drama-cannes-film-festival-1236403669/)\n\n&gt;The first film shot in Lee\u2019s native NYC in more than a decade is one of his best. It has been in various forms of development over 30 years for the likes of David Mamet, Chris Rock and others, and now Washington helped get Lee on board with it for a new take from screenwriter Alan Fox, who adapts material from Ed McBain\u2019s book *King\u2019s Ransom* and the original Kurosawa movie. The premise fits like a glove with the music industry, and Washington is smooth as silk, delivering one of his best recent performances as a man caught in an impossible moral quandary. With his fifth collaboration with Lee (*Malcolm X, He Got Game, Inside Man, Mo Better Blues*), he really finds his groove on this one to be sure.\n\n[Variety - Peter Debruge](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/highest-2-lowest-review-spike-lee-1236402884/)\n\n&gt;In the end, Lee has taken \u201cHigh and Low\u201d to new highs, delivering a soul-searching genre movie that entertains while also sounding the alarm about where the culture could be headed.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - David Rooney](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/highest-2-lowest-review-denzel-washington-spike-lee-1236221654/)\n\n&gt;Lee\u2019s adaptation doesn\u2019t match the complexities of class and hierarchy and even dynamics in a marriage that are such a fascinating part of the Kurosawa. Then again, he\u2019s not trying to, and this is a universe away from the disappointment of *Oldboy*, his 2013 remake of the Park Chan-wook thriller. The director is in the role of the flashy, panache-y showman here, and he plays it to perfection, delivering a big, highly polished chunk of movie that\u2019s pure enjoyment.\n\n[IndieWire - David Ehrlich - 'B'](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/highest-2-lowest-review-spike-lee-denzel-washington-1235124498/)\n\n&gt;\u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d is naturally at its best when it deviates from its source material. The film\u2019s wholehearted embrace of Black culture is baked into David\u2019s desire to protect Stackin\u2019 Hits from buyers who might dilute the brand of its history, but it\u2019s also suffused into the various changes that Lee\u2019s version makes to the story\u2019s third act, which pivots away from the darkness of Japan\u2019s post-war heroin epidemic and towards the aspirational aspects of hip-hop. The tension between David and Paul keeps \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d upright even when the movie around it threatens to go slack. Lee doesn\u2019t share Kurosawa\u2019s patience for long, talky, single-location sequences, and his attempts at Ice Spicing up this relatively low-event movie can be more trouble than they\u2019re worth, even if Ice Spice herself is acquitted on all charges for her two seconds of screen time.\u00a0\n\n[The Playlist - Gregory Ellwood](https://theplaylist.net/highest-2-lowest-review-spike-lee-once-again-brings-out-the-best-in-denzel-washington-cannes-20250519/) \\- B+\n\n&gt;Now, not to backtrack from what might seem like a rave review, we\u2019ll remind you that \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d has quite a rough start, and Lee\u2019s excesses are not for everyone. It\u2019s no shame that this thriller isn\u2019t even in the top pantheon of Lee joints, as he refers to them. The man has some masterpieces on his resume. It might be in Washington\u2019s, however. He\u2019s so viscerally engaging that you want to see the movie again just to enjoy his performance. Is that a result of the collective experience of having the gang back together again? Or is Washington just on a roll? Either way, let\u2019s just hope we don\u2019t have to wait another 20 years to find out.\n\n[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/may/19/highest-2-lowest-review-spike-lee-and-denzel-washington-remake-kurosawa-in-fine-style) \\- 4/5\n\n&gt;This is a big, muscular picture which aspires to the crowd-pleasing athleticism of Spike Lee\u2019s sports icons; it\u2019s very enjoyable and there\u2019s a great turn from Washington.\n\n[The Wrap - Steve Pond](https://www.thewrap.com/highest-2-lowest-review-spike-lee-denzel-washington-asap-rocky/)\n\n&gt;\u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d is a mixture of gleaming, professional filmmaking and curious choices. It\u2019s a showcase for a classic powerhouse, Washington, and an upstart one, ASAP Rocky. Overhauling and updating Kurosawa\u2019s film by turning the lead character from a shoe executive to a music mogul, it simultaneously drags the story into the social-media age and uses it to pay tribute to older urban dramas.\n\n[The Independent - Geofrrey Macnab](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/highest-2-lowest-cannes-review-denzel-washington-b2753613.html) \\- 3/5\n\n&gt;Lee is working with a top cast, but actors such as Wright and Wendell Pierce (playing one of King\u2019s music company managers) have sketchy roles. This is ultimately Washington\u2019s show. He remains as magnetic as ever, switching in a second from affability to menace, demanding respect from his sons and colleagues alike, and trying to keep multiple plates spinning at once as both his business and private lives go off the rails. It\u2019s another of his virtuoso star turns, but it\u2019s ultimately weakened by his refusal to show any emotional vulnerability whatsoever.\n\n[Screen Daily - Tim Grierson](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/highest-2-lowest-review-spike-lee-reteams-with-denzel-washington-for-ambitious-crime-thriller/5205115.article)\n\n&gt;Beyond the shaky character dynamics, the plotting often feels disjointed, despite a terrific action sequence that pays homage to a similarly riveting set piece in Kurosawa\u2019s film. But such moments are squandered in an overstuffed story that unconvincingly also wants to tackle the materialism in the hip-hop world and the scourge of social media. Ultimately, the picture\u2019s energetic swirl comes across as slightly hollow, its barrage of themes and impulses never finding harmony.",
