They would bring in ten more before ending their mission on account of darkness, but at 7:40PM, according to the ship\u2019s record, they hauled up Body 19.\n\nThat was my grandfather.\u201d",

        "content": "Back in 2008 when talking to Empire magazine, director of beloved Stephen King 90s adaptations \"The Shawshank Redemption\" and \"The Green Mile\" said what he really thought of the critics on his unloved and forgotten 2001 tale \"The Majestic\".\n\nAnd he is right!\n\nIt is a wonderful 1950s period set flick with a magical style in Darabont fashion and many forget it was actually Jim Carrey's first fully dramatic performance. It's definitely one of his finest, a complete committed career change for the 90s hit comic goof-ball and same Sandler-esque shtick, the late great Roger Ebert thought so too.\n\nAlso a nod to Frank Capra's heart-warming stories of the 30s and 40s and a movie lovers' movie, a kind of modern celebration to film.",

        "content": "I watched Taxi Driver on the ABC Sunday Night Movie in 1978 and it blew my 12-year-old mind. For an emotionally impressionable kid, who\u2019s still\nlearning to regulate emotions and understand complex feelings like alienation, despair, and moral ambiguity, it was a psychological rollercoaster ride.\n\nIt was more than just a dark film\u2014it was psychologically immersive. The score, the cinematography, the voiceover\u2014all draw you into Travis' mental space. When you're that young, the emotional residue of a film like this can \"stick,\" becoming a reference point for how you interpret intense feelings later in life.\n\nThrow in my lifelong appreciation for firearms and target shooting ( my father was a career Army drill instructor and military police officer) and I see how easily the slow, close-up pan over Easy Andy\u2019s wares was so fascinating to watch. I had seen hundreds of films up to that point, but I\u2019d never seen a camera used that way. It was close enough to read the tiny etching on the pistols. \n\nNeedless to say, I didn\u2019t go the John Hinckley route(lol), but the film left an indelible cinematic impression. And although still a pre-teen, I felt a profound sadness for Travis\u2019 isolation, rejection, and despair- in spite of his sociopathic behavior.\n\nCurious to hear about others\u2019 recollections of movies that \u201clinger\u201d for a lifetime.\n",

When the passengers and crew of a jet are incapacitated due to food poisoning, a rogue pilot with a drinking problem must cooperate with his ex-girlfriend turned stewardess to bring the plane to a safe landing. This film is a classic and one of the funniest films I have ever seen. A lot of absolutely hilarious gags that will make you die of laughter. It\u2019s got a good cast as well Robert Hays, Julie Hagerty as Ted and Elaine who met during the war and Ted gets on the flight to win back Elaine. You also have Kareem Abdul-Jabar who is the first officer pilot on the plane. Peter Graves plays the captain of the plane, Leslie Nielsen is a Dr. on the flight and Robert Stack as Captain Rex Kramer. If you haven\u2019t seen the film highly would recommend it.",

I know its meant to be set in Pennsylvania filmed in Georgia; but really coming from a non American, what a set. Jake and Hugh pull of some of the best performances ever. It;s an intriguing story from start to finish and really explores the human condition. Some people who you  most expect are innocent and those you least suspect are the most are not. I've rewatched this movie at least around 4 times by now and I love it.",

I\u2019m trying to find a very specific moment from the movie Troy (the one with Brad Pitt as Achilles). There\u2019s a line that\u2019s become pretty iconic and gets quoted a lot online when Achilles says, \u201cThat\u2019s why no one will remember your name.\u201d\n\nThe thing is, I\u2019ve seen the movie before, but I can\u2019t remember the exact moment this line is said. I know it\u2019s in the early part of the film, possibly during or right after a battle scene, but I\u2019m looking for the exact time stamp, down to the second, when Achilles says this line.\n\nI\u2019ve tried scrolling through the movie, checking YouTube clips, and even reading the script online, but I haven\u2019t been able to pinpoint the precise moment. I figured someone out there might already know it or be able to check and let me know.\n\nIf you happen to have the movie on hand or already know the time stamp, I\u2019d really appreciate it if you could share it here. Ideally, I\u2019m looking for something like: \u201cAchilles says the line at 00:14:38\u201d or whatever the correct time is.\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to respond. Even if you just have a rough estimate or a direction to look in, that\u2019d be super helpful. Appreciate y\u2019all! ",
