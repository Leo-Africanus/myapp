        "content": "I was watching parts of the Bradley Cooper movie *Burnt* the other day, and there's a scene in which he's speaking to a rival chef with whom he used to work, and the other chef asks Cooper's character (named Adam Jones) something to the effect of \"what happened to your angelic face?\" and Jones basically responds that hard living has taken its toll.  \n\nNow, setting aside whether anyone wishes to describe Bradley Cooper or anyone else as \"angelic\"-looking, in the scene itself there was actually nothing visibly wrong with Bradley Cooper's face!  The chef looked just like Bradley Cooper looks in nearly all of his movies, which is a handsome movie star.  (Later in *Burnt*, he is beaten up, and his face is cut and bruised, but that hadn't yet happened in this scene.)  Doesn't the director or anyone else make this connection?  I know that they don't want to make their pretty-boy movie star *too* ugly, but then couldn't they just tweak the script to say something else?  \n\nAnother example is *The Devil Wears Prada*, in which Ann Hathaway's character is repeatedly described as being overweight or outright fat.  Now, yes, she was working in the fashion industry, where body standards can be unrealistic, but the character at one point describes *herself* as being \"not skinny.\"  Even by fashion industry standards, there's no way anyone would reasonably call her \"fat,\" as Meryl Streep's character does at one point.  The character looked just like Ann Hathaway looks in nearly all of her movies, which is a fit, pretty movie star.  She and Emily Blunt even commiserated on set over how hungry they both were, because she *and* Hathaway *lost weight to play the role*.  ",

        "content": "Hey all! I was wondering if I could get some recommendations for some movies that in some way glorify killing Nazis (or general white supremacists/fascists). \n\nI want something that feels like the Wolfenstein game reboots, though I'm open to more grounded films, as long as they have some form of Nazi suffering by the end.\n\nOn my list so far are three films that I feel demonstrate the vibe I'm seeking better than my words:\n\n\\- JoJo Rabbit (2019) *dir. Taika Waititi*\n\n\\- BlacKkKlansman (2018) *dir. Spike Lee*\n\n\\- Inglorious Basterds (2009) *dir. Quentin Tarantino*\n\n*(also maybe Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) dir. Steven Spielberg)*\n\nI would love a wide array of suggestions. Any setting from the 1930s to the future, in any country, in any multiverse. I'm sure there's some old WWII propaganda films that could fit the bill, or niche animated superhero from the 50s and 60s. Just remember that the Nazis don't have to be WWII German Nazis, as long as they were inspired by them. Thank you!",

They are searching for Mar \u2014 daughter and sister \u2014 who vanished months ago at one of these endless, sleepless parties. Surrounded by electronic music and a raw, unfamiliar sense of freedom, they hand out her photo again and again. Hope is fading, but they push through and follow a group of ravers heading to one last party in the desert. As they venture deeper into the burning wilderness, the journey forces them to confront their own limits.",

I would also like to see Mark Romanek (One Hour Photo, Never Let Me Go) get another shot.\n\nWhat are your choices and why",

        "content": "i was recently watching a film released in 2005 and it struck me how long ago this actually was.....20 years is a long time but the film looked like it could have been new. in others words had i been walking by the tv and looked briefly id have never known whether it was 20 yrs old or released in the last few years, and it struck me that this has been true for a while, but was not true for decades past....\n\nin 2005 you would absolutely know a film from 1985 was an 80s film just by looking at it, even briefly (or 75 or 65 for that matter) and i was curious why this is? is it the filming style? the cameras or filming styles not having changed as drastically? \n\nobviously if you watch a film in its entirety there will be subtle clues about its time of release like flip phones or clothing (but i also notice fashions havent changed as much in the last 15 yrs as they have in decades past) but there really is a lack of distinguishing features about films of the last 20 yrs than there used to be. \n\nif you gave me brief clips of films from every decade of the last 100 yrs i could surely identify every decade up until roughly the mid to late 00s and id probably struggle without seeing some cultural clue. you can no longer tell visually \n\nanyone else notice this or have any thoughts or insight about why this is?
