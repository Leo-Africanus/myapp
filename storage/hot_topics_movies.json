        "content": "*A woman's obsessive search for her missing sister leads her into a terrifying mystery at the hands of an unknown evil.*\n\nCast: Camille Sullivan, Keith David, Michael Bleach\n\nRelease Date: October 24, 2025 (Distributor - NEON)\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [83%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shelby_oaks/reviews)\n\n**Metacritic:** [N/A (updating)](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/shelby-oaks/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Slashfilm - BJ Colangelo](https://www.slashfilm.com/1626527/shelby-oaks-review/) \\- 8 / 10\n\n&gt;It's clear that Chris Stuckmann loves horror and has taken his years of determining what he likes and what he thinks \"works\" by reviewing films on YouTube to shape his craft. At no point does it feel like \"Shelby Oaks\" is anything other than the very best version of what he intended to make, as opposed to the numerous films by first-time feature filmmakers who spend too much time trying to make something they *think* they're supposed to make. The result is a deeply unsettling view that never loses its sense of heart or humanity. With Sullivan's phenomenal performance and Stuckmann's keen eye, \"Shelby Oaks\" allows us to witness the start of one of the most promising new voices in horror.\n\n[Gizmodo - German Lussier](https://gizmodo.com/shelby-oaks-puts-a-satisfying-scary-spin-on-the-found-footage-genre-2000661720)\n\n&gt;This is a horror film for and by the YouTube generation: one that\u2019s inspired by many horror films of the past, with little regard for when or how to borrow from them. As long as it\u2019s cool and scary. Which *Shelby Oaks* is.\n\n[Polygon - Jake Kleinman](https://www.polygon.com/shelby-oaks-review-chris-stuckmann/)\n\n&gt;Overall, Stuckmann\u2019s directorial debut is a sturdy horror movie from a lover of film who clearly understands the genre. While the involvement of indie distributor Neon and producer Mike Flanagan must have gone a long way (For a sense of what the original version of *Shelby Oaks* was like, you can read the mostly positive reviews from its initial premiere at 2024\u2019s Fantasia International Film Festival), there\u2019s strong evidence of talent \u2014 and cinematic depravity \u2014 to be seen.\n\n[RogerEbert - Brian Tallerico](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/shelby-oaks-chris-stuckmann-fantastic-fest-movie-review-2025) \\- 2 / 4\n\n&gt;Stuckmann is a smart dude, and one has to admire the commitment to getting this film made. He\u2019ll bounce back, especially given he\u2019s now been given a thumbs-up by Neon. He was also smart enough to give character actor Keith David a movie-stealing scene as the former prison warden who tells Mia about how his facility went to shit and how one of his inmates might have been possessed. A movie about a guy trying to run a haunted prison might have felt more original than this retread. Maybe they can explore that idea in the sequel. At least it\u2019s a new one.",

        "title": "After Godzilla Minus One I Watched 82 Kaiju Films in Six Months",
        "content": "(Note: I wrote these notes for /godzilla, but thought I'd see if it could be a conversation starter here.)  \n  \nThis March, I finally saw Godzilla Minus One.\n\nI\u2019d been meaning to for a year, after catching a clip of the boat chase. Having only seen Godzilla \u201998 prior, Minus One hooked me on the franchise.\n\nI\u2019d heard it was a prequel to the \u201954 original. (Turns out, not quite.) But that led me to Criterion\u2019s 4K release. Drawn in, I proceeded with the Showa era set and followed through with the rest of the Godzilla canon. Still curious, I watched every other major kaiju film, including proto-kaiju and kaiju-adjacent entries.\n\nThese are my notes on that journey, including my tier rankings. If I seem contrarian, just know I was totally ignorant of consensus. And if this all seems like self-indulgent bullshit, hey, don't read it, whatever.\n\nAll in all, I loved this experience and will be a Godzilla fan for life.\n\n**The Terror of Western Godzilla: 2014 vs. Minus One**\n\nOne thing I learned watching 130-some hours of kaiju:\n\nIn a character-driven story, the central conflict needs resonate within the protagonist. Otherwise, it\u2019s just stuff happening.\n\nTo say it another way: in order to transcend being just an FX monster that smashes fake buildings, Godzilla must mean something to our leads.\n\nThat\u2019s why I opted to include *The Host* in my rankings despite it not being strictly a kaiju film. In addition to being a noted influence on *Godzilla Minus One*, it exemplifies a character-driven monster story. Our leads have clear stakes tied to the monster. The unfolding conflict illuminates our leads to us and their relationships with one another. Because the plot and emotional context move as one, the action\u2019s climax is received and felt on an emotional level.\n\nThis kind of thematic monster story is something Steven Spielberg (a student of Japanese cinema) does very well. Consider *Jurassic Park*. Alan Grant doesn\u2019t just save a couple kids. Instead, he overcomes his aversion to kids, discovers something noble in himself, and leaves the island greater than he arrived. *Godzilla Minus One* operates in that same tradition.\n\nWhen Godzilla lands at Ginza, Koichi is forced to confront the same monster that caused him to choke in fear years earlier. His desperation to save Noriko shows his transformation into someone ready to act despite mortal terror, specifically for his chosen family. After Noriko is swept away, the loss compounds his guilt and drives his determination in the final confrontation with Godzilla. What's more, we're left to wonder if he'll choose to live despite this grief.\n\nContrast this with the sequence from *Godzilla 2014,* in which Ford Brody (woof) saves the abandoned boy on the train. There, the situation resolves with Brody totally unaffected. Despite opportunities around his mother's death, his estranged father, or his own family, the film never invests in emotional stakes. Even when Ford's military expertise becomes useful, it's devoid of emotional weight. After Act I, our lead's story doesn't intersect meaningfully with the monster conflict. The result is a face-melting CG climax in the service of nothing.\n\nThis refusal to engage us plagues Legendary\u2019s MonsterVerse. Their next Godzilla film swings so hard in the opposite direction its theme becomes unrelatable. *King of the Monsters\u2019* eco-terrorist question of erasing humanity to save the planet gestures at a philosophical dilemma, but it never roots the question in relatable human experience.\n\nJapanese kaiju explores themes of real, shared cultural anxieties like nuclear trauma, the shame of occupation, chemical pollution, or the pitfalls of bureaucracy. If western kaiju can muster a theme at all, it hides behind banal, supervillain, blockbuster tropes.\n\nI know that films don't all need to be Spielbergian monster-as-daddy stories. *Shin Godzilla* succeeds by taking a different approach (exploring the response of human systems). *Destroy All Monsters* succeeds as campy fun. And hey, it\u2019s great! I love the Showa era. But if a storyteller wants me to relate emotionally to its characters, all the Dolby Vision and Atmos in the world won\u2019t substitute for a resonant theme and relatable stakes.\n\nThat\u2019s why *Minus One* lured me into the genre and why it deserves the acclaim. It proves stories are still powerful and that the fundamentals still matter.\n\nHaving said all that, I also enjoy ridiculous Tokusatsu suitmation adventures! Which leads me to\u2026\n\n**Horror of the Zeitgeist: Tokusatsu vs. CG**\n\nFor most modern viewers, Tokusatsu films will bounce off their eyeballs as ludicrous and primitive relics from before CG. Nothing more than fodder for *Mystery Science Theater 3000*. But when I engaged with them on their own terms, something clicked. The magic isn\u2019t in realism. It\u2019s in craft and participation.\n\nSome moments where my love of the genre took root:\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mothra\u2019s twin larvae racing across the sea to blast Godzilla with silk\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The gang curb-stomping Ghidorah in *Destroy All Monsters*\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hedorah sucking exhaust from a factory smokestack\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mechagodzilla soaring past Godzilla and peppering him with missiles\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The epic finale of the original *Daimajin*\n\nThese scenes invite you to play along. As with pro wrestling, Tokusatsu runs on kayfabe. You know it\u2019s a guy in a suit. You know the buildings are miniatures. But if you can engage with the illusion, the payoff can become real.\n\nThe Showa era feels magical to me because it wasn\u2019t embarrassed to be Tokusatsu. The Heisei era, by contrast, seemed darker and more self-serious, as if trying to shed its own silly legacy. (I understand there were more complex cultural factors of the era I\u2019m not an expert on.) The Millennium era felt even more detached, willing to sacrifice character legacy to chase contemporary tastes. Though Tokusatsu remained the medium, its tone wavered as the cultural zeitgeist shifted.\n\nToho\u2019s reaction to *Godzilla \u201998* seems a flashpoint. Maybe it was the redesign. Maybe the story. Maybe the box office. But I wonder if it wasn\u2019t the CG. (After all, they parodied it in *Final Wars*, as if reclaiming the joke.)\n\nWatching the films chronologically, I detected a shift once I crossed the CG threshold. My tolerance for weak stories and dull characters dropped. It seems when the suits and miniatures are gone, I stop playing along as willingly. I start asking what all this spectacle is in service of.\n\nMaybe it's just the novelty of an antique era? Today, competent CG is now a baseline expectation. Suitmation never was. Its novelty is inexhaustible, as is its humanity. You can feel the fingerprints on every frame. (To be fair though, I\u2019m not excited by lame Tokusatsu either.)\n\nIn the end, I guess what makes a film prescient is how it arrives in the zeitgeist of its era. And not just in its FX. Some of the Godzilla Tokusatsu films are exemplars of their era. The MonsterVerse CG films just aren\u2019t.\n\nIn 2024, *Godzilla Minus One* earned Toho the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, signaling they\u2019re once again operating at the forefront of the technical zeitgeist. The Tokusatsu-inspired CG of that film feels like the culmination of a tradition stretching back to Honda and Tsuburaya. I'm sure it felt like quite the achievement for the studio, and proves that Tokusatsu was always an important language in the evolution of filmmaking.\n\n**Me vs. Consensus**\n\nAfter ranking the Godzilla canon, I compared my list to others. It was interesting to note the discrepancies.\n\n**Things I didn\u2019t enjoy as much as consensus:**\n\n* **GMK** \u2013 The characterizations felt off. Why use Mothra if it\u2019s not fully Mothra? Why use Ghidorah if it\u2019s not really Ghidorah? They felt more like arbitrary selections than intentional deconstructions.\n* **Godzilla vs. Destoroyah** \u2013 I just couldn\u2019t get wrapped up in it. It felt like an event that I wasn't in on. Will revisit someday.\n* **Aliens and Ghidorah** \u2013 I don\u2019t prefer the alien stories. They just felt like ways to get Ghidorah on the screen. On that note, Ghidorah doesn\u2019t feel grounded or well-conceived to me. For contrast, Hedorah has a thematic design that suits its backstory. A species arrived by comet and evolved in chemical pollutants? I get it. But a bulbous three-headed dragon from space just wasn\u2019t for me.\n* **Heisei Gamera** \u2013 Oversold to me in advance. While impressive for its era and clearly an FX revolution, the attempt to bring weight to the character struck me as flat and joyless overall. The second film made me wonder if I\u2019d just seen too many kaiju military efforts by that point.\n\n**Some things I enjoyed more than consensus:**\n\n* **Gamera the Brave** \u2013 I was expecting it to be bad, but as a family film, it worked and had a satisfying conclusion. Probably the best kids/family kaiju movie I watched.\n* **Godzilla vs. Hedorah** \u2013 I grew up on *Mad Magazine*, pot, and the Beatles, so this was a big hit for me. I plan to watch it again as soon as possible.\n* **Son of Godzilla** \u2013 The campy monster story contrasted well with the survivalist human drama. The other island monsters were great. It felt well-conceived all around, despite some goofy design.\n* **Ebirah, Horror of the Deep** \u2013 I liked the setup of the guys stowing away with the criminal. Their infiltration scheme was decent. They all had something to contribute. The water fights were cool. He rips the guy\u2019s claw off and waves it at him. Come on.\n* **The War of the Gargantuas** \u2013 This stands out as the most MST3K-worthy film of them all. It\u2019s a blast to watch with others because it\u2019s exceedingly campy and ridiculous. \u201cFrankenstein\u2019s ghost has apparently been eating some people.\u201d Okay then. (Bonus: It stars Dr. Jacoby for you Twin Peaks fans.)\n\n**Extra Gushing**\n\n* **Rodan** \u2013 The standalone *Rodan* film is great. Awesome to see a color Showa film that retains a horror tone. Well-paced. The aerial stuff is great and unique. The ants were bad, but *Rodan* remains one of the best Showa kaiju films.\n* **Mothra and the Shobijin/Cosmos** \u2013 I adore Mothra. The mythos, design, and character are spectacular. The Peanuts are icons. Love the musical summoning component.\n* **The Kiryu Saga** \u2013 I appreciated the quality of these two films. They weren\u2019t outrageous and didn\u2019t swing as hard as other entries, but were well done, compelling, and had satisfying action.\n* **Akira Ifukube** \u2013 Some of this music is incredible. The opening title theme of *Rodan* is otherworldly. Big fan.\n\n**Origin Stories**\n\nIn conclusion: a kaiju film is like a kaiju itself.\n\nThe best ones have profound origins, born from fear, satire, grief, or joy. They\u2019re distinct in design, combining familiar elements into something bold and unforgettable. They have a silhouette that reads like a signature.\n\nEach succeeds or fails on the strength of its own identity. Some are nightmares, manifesting our collective anxieties. Some reflect our notions of heroism. Some make us cheer. Some make us laugh. And some are lovably ridiculous without apology.\n\nOf course, some are forgettable. Some are manufactured. And some are abominations we should stuff into the core of the planet.\n\nBut the fact that kaiju films can succeed across such a diversity of approaches suggests there are still frontiers left to raid. My hope for the genre\u2019s future is to see giant monsters storm them all.\n\n**My Rankings**\n\nNote: I haven't revisited or scrutinized my comments here, so I preemptively disown them.\n\n**S-Tier (Ranked)**\n\n1. **Godzilla Minus One** (2023, *Toho*) \u2013 The total package.\n2. **Shin Godzilla** (2016, *Toho*) \u2013 The coolest entry. Outstanding opening Act I.\n3. **King Kong** (1933, *RKO*) \u2013 A work of vision with incredible animation that creates a legend from thin air.\n4. **Godzilla** (1954, *Toho*) \u2013 Vision and theme elevate B-movie subject to sublime effect. A genre is born.\n5. **The Host** (2006, *Chungeorahm*) \u2013 Not totally kaiju, but an outstanding monster film that modernizes the genre and influences kaiju to come.\n\n**A-Tier (Ranked)**\n\n1. **Godzilla vs. Hedorah** (1971, *Toho*) \u2013 Godzilla's hippie freakout is a blast. Well-developed challenger in Hedorah.\n2. **Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.** (2003, *Toho*) \u2013 Satisfying and just highly competent, balances spectacle with story investment.\n3. **Mothra vs. Godzilla** (1964, *Toho*) \u2013 The first time the vs. formula really works. Match made in Heaven.\n4. **Rodan** (1956, *Toho*) \u2013 Kaiju still operating as horror. Transcends the era.\n5. **Godzilla vs. Mothra** (1992, *Toho*) \u2013 A return to form that still works.\n\n**B-Tier (Ranked)**\n\n1. **Godzilla vs. Biollante** (1989, *Toho*) \u2013 Singular mood among the films, with intriguing threat and great human characters.\n2. **Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla** (2002, *Toho*) \u2013 More effective and sincere than others in goofy Millennium era.\n3. **Destroy All Monsters** (1968, *Toho*) \u2013 Silly? Yes. Fun? Definitely. Great action sequences. Great kaiju selection.\n4. **The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms** (1953, *Warner*) \u2013 Proto Godzilla shines in stunning city destruction with great animation.\n5. **Godzilla vs. Megaguirus** (2000, *Toho*) \u2013 A romp that has fun with itself in Godzilla's awkward era.\n6. **Son of Godzilla** (1967, *Toho*) \u2013 Compelling kaiju action despite the goofy little guy with decent human storyline.\n7. **Ebirah, Horror of the Deep** (1966, *Toho*) \u2013 One of the best human character ensembles and story with good action sequences.\n8. **Mothra** (1961, *Toho*) \u2013 Feels classic and essential immediately and doesn't disappoint.\n9. **Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla** (1974, *Toho*) \u2013 The Showa era tries for a more mature sci-fi story after too much kid crap. Mechagodzilla rules.\n\n**C-Tier (Ranked)**\n\n1. **Godzilla vs. Megalon** (1973, *Toho*) \u2013 Jet frickin' Jaguar. It's a fun one and the best example of Godzilla as camp.\n2. **King Kong** (2005, *Universal*) \u2013 Jackson's competent if bloated Kong is fine.\n3. **Daimajin** (1966, *Daiei*) \u2013 Incredible final ten minutes. Slow and dull buildup.\n4. **Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II** (1993, *Toho*) \u2013 A cool entry for Mechagodzilla with status quo human drama.\n5. **Gamera the Brave** (2006, *Kadokawa*) \u2013 Better-than-expected family film with a great third act.\n6. **Gamera: Guardian of the Universe** (1995, *Daiei*) \u2013 Overrated, dry, and too serious, but outstanding effects.\n7. **The Return of Godzilla** (1984, *Toho*) \u2013 Self-conscious reboot, not as much fun as it should've been.\n8. **Them!** (1954, *Warner*) \u2013 Stylish and cool for its day. Drags in the second half.\n9. **Godzilla vs. Destoroyah** (1995, *Toho*) \u2013 Grim spectacle and not much fun. Finale didn't seem to earn impact. Confusing opening. 1954 tie-ins interesting.\n10. **Gamera vs. Barugon** (1966, *Daiei*) \u2013 The most entertaining Showa era Gamera, but this schtick won't hold.\n11. **Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster** (1964, *Toho*) \u2013 Hokey alien storyline with a repeat climax from *Mothra vs. Godzilla*.\n12. **Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris** (1999, *Daiei*) \u2013 Another dour Gamera entry that begs you to believe.\n13. **The War of the Gargantuas** (1966, *Toho*) \u2013 Bad overall, but the most fun flick in its tier. Good for viewing with friends.\n14. **Shin Ultraman** (2022, *Toho/Khara*) \u2013 Great to look at. Fun at first. Storyline wears.\n15. **Pacific Rim** (2013, *Legendary*) \u2013 Mech action film using kaiju. Bogged down by its own lore. Wanted to love it, but was exhausted by it.\n16. **Godzilla Raids Again** (1955, *Toho*) \u2013 Over-hated Godzilla sequel with some fun human performances.\n17. **Frankenstein vs. Baragon** (1965, *Toho*) \u2013 All kaiju movies should aspire to be this strange.\n18. **Terror of Mechagodzilla** (1975, *Toho*) \u2013 Decent, but the human storyline feels reheated and overwrought.\n19. **Gamera the Giant Monster** (1965, *Daiei*) \u2013 Competent but unnecessary Godzilla knock-off. Fun novelty.\n20. **Gamera 2: Attack of Legion** (1996, *Daiei*) \u2013 Middle part of trilogy does nothing to build to its finale. Dull military procedural. Great effects.\n21. **King Kong vs. Godzilla** (1962, *Toho*) \u2013 Notable for introducing the vs. format, but the action is half-assed and Kong looks terrible.\n22. **GMK: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack** (2001, *Toho*) \u2013 Treats kaiju as a grab-bag of toys with revisionist lore. Horror tone is unique. Felt more arbitrary than deconstructed.\n\n**D-Tier (Chronological)**\n\n* **Invasion of Astro-Monster** (1965, *Toho*) \u2013 Goofy space story with dumb dancing.\n* **Gappa** (1967, *Nikkatsu*) \u2013 More charm than a lot of these one-off knock-offs, with charismatic actors. Ultimately generic.\n* **Gamera vs. Gyaos** (1967, *Daiei*) \u2013 Gamera really wearing out his welcome here with this dull challenger.\n* **Godzilla vs. Gigan** (1972, *Toho*) \u2013 Goofy action, muddled human drama, weird buddy vibes.\n* **Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah** (1991, *Toho*) \u2013 Incoherent plot drags out overrated nemesis for a weirdly self-conscious Heisei entry.\n* **Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla** (1994, *Toho*) \u2013 Tedious Miki melodrama. Worst action of the Heisei era?\n* **Rebirth of Mothra** (1996, *Toho*) \u2013 An attempt at a family film that has some cute moments, but feels unnecessary.\n* **GODZILLA** (1998, *TriStar*) \u2013 Notoriously bad, yet still gives its characters more weight than the horrible *Godzilla '14*.\n* **Cloverfield** (2008, *Paramount*) \u2013 Feels like a student film. Can't maintain the found footage aesthetic.\n* **GODZILLA: Planet of Monsters** (2017, *Toho*) \u2013 Barely a Godzilla/kaiju product. At least trying something.\n\n**F-Tier (Chronological)**\n\n* **Son of Kong** (1933, *RKO*) \u2013 WTF is this?\n* **The Mysterians** (1957, *Toho*) \u2013 Kaiju sounds like an alarm clock.\n* **Varan the Unbelievable** (1958, *Toho*) \u2013 Half-assed compared to other Toho. Incoherent action sequences.\n* **The Giant Behemoth** (1959, *Artistes*) \u2013 Dull.\n* **Gorgo** (1961, *King Brothers*) \u2013 British nautical knock-off of *Godzilla* by way of *King Kong*.\n* **Atragon** (1963, *Toho*) \u2013 Novel as a Toho film of its era but dull and barely kaiju.\n* **Return of Daimajin** (1966, *Daiei*) \u2013 Boring repeat.\n* **Wrath of Daimajin** (1966, *Daiei*) \u2013 Another boring repeat.\n* **The X from Outer Space** (1967, *Shochiku*) \u2013 Unremarkable.\n* **King Kong Escapes** (1967, *Toho*) \u2013 Janky 60s Kong fails. Stupid plot. Looks awful.\n* **Gamera vs. Viras** (1968, *Daiei*) \u2013 Schlock.\n* **All Monsters Attack** (1969, *Toho*) \u2013 Stock footage clip show with dopey bullying message.\n* **Gamera vs. Guiron** (1969, *Daiei*) \u2013 Crap.\n* **Space Amoeba** (1970, *Toho*) \u2013 Low-mid Toho with no inspiration. Had no patience for this.\n* **Gamera vs. Jiger** (1970, *Daiei*) \u2013 Bullshit.\n* **Gamera vs. Zigra** (1971, *Daiei*) \u2013 No.\n* **King Kong** (1976, *DEG/Paramount*) \u2013 The Dude is not enough to save this weak, dated impression of a timeless classic.\n* **The Mighty Peking Man** (1977, *Shaw Bros*) \u2013 Almost fun.\n* **Gamera: Super Monster** (1980, *Daiei*) \u2013 Fart sound.\n* **King Kong Lives** (1986, *DEG*) \u2013 Torture.\n* **Rebirth of Mothra II** (1997, *Toho*) \u2013 My eyes crossed trying to stay focused on this.\n* **Rebirth of Mothra III** (1998, *Toho*) \u2013 Just let it end.\n* **Godzilla 2000: Millennium** (1999, *Toho*) \u2013 Okay concept, dull execution. Yawn.\n* **Godzilla: Final Wars** (2004, *Toho*) \u2013 Put down the *Animatrix* and step away from the Godzilla. A tacky nightmare.\n* **Godzilla (2014)** (*Legendary*) \u2013 Inexcusable to not thematically tie the lead to the monster. Cynical, vacuous flop.\n* **Kong: Skull Island** (2017, *Legendary*) \u2013 Did someone make this movie at gunpoint? Hollow and dull with trite, forced nostalgia.\n* **GODZILLA: City on the Edge of Battle** (2018, *Toho*) \u2013 Melodramatic, dull, and not kaiju.\n* **GODZILLA: The Planet Eater** (2018, *Toho*) \u2013 Let it end, dear god.\n* **Godzilla: King of the Monsters** (2019, *Legendary*) \u2013 Big budget slop doesn't respect these characters or this genre at all.\n* **Godzilla vs. Kong** (2021, *Legendary*) \u2013 No heart and no competent storytelling. What am I supposed to be engaged by here?\n* **Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire** (2024, *Legendary*) \u2013 Embarrassing.",

        "content": "HUGE fan of this random-ass film - the concept is highly intriguing and I want to find more stuff like this. 50 people wake up in a strange, dark room (I won\u2019t reveal what or where the room is), and discover that every few minutes they have to vote anonymously to eliminate one person in the group. The cast of characters is diverse in that it includes almost every stereotype (in a good way) - you have a wealthy conservative businessman, an ex con, a pregnant lady, an immigrant, a military grunt, a crafty tech millennial, etc etc etc. It comes across as a contrived social experiment, but they\u2019re voting people to their immediate death so the stakes are pretty damn high. It\u2019s interesting to see all of the different archetypes of people interact/state their case(s)/align with other archetypal characters. \n\nIt\u2019s a simple plot but it\u2019s damn intriguing to me for some reason. I love elimination shows like survivor so maybe that factors in, but either way: I highly recommend this quick watch (it\u2019s MAYBE an hour 20 - similar in length\u2014and tone\u2014to a Black Mirror episode). Especially if you like to see a group of people narrow down until there\u2019s one left. It\u2019s very well-written in my opinion. The direction is what it is - you can\u2019t ask for incredible camera angles or shots in a one-room psychological thriller\n\nI weirdly love this movie and have seen it/\u201cshown it to people\u201d like 5 times. First saw it when I was a young teenager; within the first 5 minutes I was hooked. But I also have an affinity for these \u201cone room\u201d psychological thrillers (they\u2019re rare, unfortunately, and typically poorly reviewed, to my astonishment - \u201cExam\u201d is another that falls in this genre). \n\nHave you seen it? If so, do you have any similar recs? What did you think of this film?  WHICH \u201cPLAYER\u201d DID YOU FAVOR, IF ANY? I\u2019m truly interested to hear from folks who saw this.",
