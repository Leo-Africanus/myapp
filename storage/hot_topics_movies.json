I love discovering breakout talent and building unforgettable ensembles. AMA!\n\nI'll be back at 8 PM ET today (Wednesday 4/30) to answer your questions. Ask me anything!\n\nView the official trailer for \u201cThe Wedding Banquet\u201d here: \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWy\\_IzW04YM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWy_IzW04YM)\n\nMy credits:\n\n[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1937563/](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1937563/)\n\nUp next: \"Untitled Avatar: The Last Airbender\" (Paramount/Avatar Studios), \"Mike and Nick and Nick and Alice\" (20th Century Studios), and \"Ballerina Overdrive\" (Amazon Studios).\n\nMore bio information:\n\nCSA Award-winning Casting Director Jenny Jue, whose two-decade career includes standout collaborations with Quentin Tarantino (\"Inglourious Basterds\"), Bong Joon Ho (\"Okja\", \"Snowpiercer\"), and Netflix\u2019s \"The Brother\u2019s Sun.\u201d\n\nJenny\u2019s latest project, \"The Wedding Banquet\" (Bleecker Street), is a 2025 reimagining of the Ang Lee classic, directed by Andrew Ahn and starring Lily Gladstone, Bowen Yang, Kelly Marie Tran, Joan Chen, and Youn Yuh-jung. Premiering to rave reviews at Sundance and in theaters nationwide April 18, 2025, the film explores queerness, chosen family, and generational identity with depth and humor. Jenny spent two years casting the project, navigating the unique challenges of post-strike independent filmmaking while shaping an ensemble that feels instinctive and human.\n\nJenny\u2019s path to casting was anything but conventional. Raised in Southern California by a family of engineers, she initially pursued a pre-law track at UCLA. But a last-minute internship with iconic casting director Johanna Ray (\"Mulholland Drive\", \"Twin Peaks\") changed everything. Jenny spent nearly a decade under Ray\u2019s mentorship before founding her own company, Downtown Casting, in 2012. Since then, she\u2019s become the go-to casting director for auteurs seeking global talent and emotional authenticity\u2014balancing the demands of prestige cinema with stories that feel intimate, lived-in, and often underrepresented. Her work spans genres, from the from the stylized action of \"Kate\" to the unsettling realism of the BAFTA-nominated documentary \"The Social Dilemma.\"",

        "content": "[George Miller (of Mad Max) once said that one of his favorite shots is from The Godfather](https://youtu.be/raX0pJDKOEc?si=QE54J_DhMnynvrMN&amp;t=363), when Michael is in Italy and takes a girl out on a date. Michael and the girl walk past the camera bashfully flirting, followed by a group of female relatives chaperoning and chatting amongst themselves, and then followed by two guys with shotguns. You can see the whole story of Michael's time in Italy in a single moment.\n\nIt's a great shot, and funnily enough I can totally see the resemblance to some shots in Fury Road -- where the camera kinda lingers and lets different characters and groups fall in and out of frame, in a way that tells an effective mini-story.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite shots that tell their own stories?",

        "title": "I finally saw the Conan The Barbarian movies and they were nothing like I expected",
        "content": "I recently bought Mortal Kombat 1 on sale with all the DLC and was trying to figure out who to play.\n\nI decided to go in reverse order on the character select menu which made me choose Conan first. I knew very little about the movies or character other than Arnold plays him\n\nSo after playing Conan I really started enjoying him and decided I needed to see where he came from.\n\nMy expectations were that Conan The Barbarian and Destroyer were just dumb 80s action movies and there would be a lot of violence and bravado without much substance.\n\nBoy was I wrong. Instead I found its an Epic Dark Fantasy movie with awesome music, tons of camp, and a great performance by the late James Earl Jones.\n\nBoth movies reminded me of a DnD campaign. I did not expect the movies to be so nerdy in the fantasy element. I was expecting Expendables level of dumb but instead I got Lord of the Rings movie before Lord of the Rings.\n\nI liked how the movies did little to explain things or even hype up certain moments. There's a part in Conan 1 where Conan gets crucified. Any other movie would have a super hyped up, dark and depression lead up to him getting tortured, etc.\n\nIn the actual movie, James Earl Jones says \"crucify him\" and it immediately just jumps to Conan on a tree with 0 build up.\n\nSimilarly Conan somehow sneaks into the enemy stronghold at the end with absolutely no fighting any guards and gets all the way to Thulsa Doom to kill him with 0 explanation. \n\nIt doesn't feel the need to baby the audience and I like that.\n\nConan 2 felt more like a standard fantasy adventure until the end. I did not expect the final battle to be against a giant fish monster god.\n\nMy wife and I ended up really enjoying the movies and I can tell why they are cult classics. \n\nI really enjoyed all the side Characters. Valeria was badass. Subotai was a total bro helping Conan after just meeting him. Malak made a good comedy relief while being super helpful in key moments. Zulu was a badass and had some awesome goofy facial expressions throughout.\n\nI'm glad I decided to finally watch these cult classics. Is the 2010 reboot with Jason Mamoa any good?",

I got a high fever, nausea, and sometimes hallucinations. \n\nAnyway, I was sick, couldn't sleep because of the fever, so I just randomly turned my TV on and saw the title, 'Robin Hood'. I thought it was Kevin Costner's Robin Hood, I didn't read the 'Men in Tights' part.\n\nSo for the next two hours, I was laughing despite the pain and was confused about what was going on. I never used drugs, but that movie gave me an experience of what it feels like to be high. For the next 10 years or so, I thought that movie was some kind of fever dream, until I saw a clip of it on YouTube. \"Wait, so that wasn't a dream??!! THAT'S AN ACTUAL MOVIE??!!\"\n\nHighly recommended, an absolute 20/10. 12 Angry Men? Goodfellas?

It\u2019s a force strong enough to cohere a string of spandex-clad blockbusters into one of the defining cultural phenomena of the 21st century, and \u2014\u00a0just maybe \u2014\u00a0a force strong enough to save that series of blockbusters from collapsing under its own weight in the face of certain Doom. Time will tell. The good news for the MCU is that \u201cThunderbolts\\*\u201d buys them some more of it, and at a much-needed discount.\n\n[Variety - Peter Debruge](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/thunderbolts-review-marvel-the-new-avengers-1236381303/)\n\n&gt;However frivolous it may sound, Schreier\u2019s scrappy ensemble effort is anything but a one-off (and considering its almost $200 million budget, not so scrappy either). It may star six characters you either forgot about or couldn\u2019t name if your life depended on it, but going forward, you\u2019ll be expected to know who they are and could be quizzed on events that happen in \u201cThunderbolts\u201d at any time \u2014 starting with the asterisk that appears after the title, and the explanation which rewards opening-weekend audiences with spoiling for everyone who catches up with it late.\n\n[Empire - John Nugent](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/thunderbolts/) \\- 3/5\n\n&gt;It doesn\u2019t always land, but it dares to be different, from the title to the team-up.

While it very capably dabbles in a darker tone \u2013 touching on the mental health of heroes and villains alike \u2013 the filmmakers struggle to balance that dabbling with a snappy, comedic energy. While the movie as a whole left me feeling like it was a downer on the balance, it\u2019s at least the good kind of downer, filled with characters I\u2019m looking forward to seeing again.\n\n[SlashFilm - BJ Colangelo](https://www.slashfilm.com/1846662/marvel-thunderbolts-movie-review/) \\- 7/10\n\n&gt;\"Thunderbolts\\*\" is exactly the type of movie the MCU needs right now, but after a losing streak of less-than-stellar performances, I fear that audiences won't turn out for the second-string players, which will only send the message to the powers at be to go back to the boring, safe, well of familiarity. But I hope I'm wrong. I hope that \"Thunderbolts\\*\" overperforms at the box office and helps usher in a new era of Marvel movies that allows actors to act, stakes to be raised by putting characters in tangible environments instead of CGI hellscapes, characters that force us to flex our empathy muscles, and Florence Pugh leading the way.\n\n[Collider - Ross Bonaime](https://collider.com/thunderbolts-review-mcu/) \\- 8/10\n\n&gt;*Thunderbolts\\** might not be the mightiest hero that the MCU needs, but **it feels like this cinematic universe is taking a step forward in an already convoluted world.** This isn\u2019t necessarily a huge sea change, but it shows that even this deep in, Marvel can tell smarter, more emotional stories without forsaking fun, action, and big explosions. It\u2019s the sort of level that more superhero films should be at, and shows exciting promise for where these movies could go (especially with *Fantastic Four* coming in just a few months). And even though the film does at times feel like it's setting up for future projects, it never feels burdened by this, but rather, like we're seeing the natural progression of where these characters' stories should lead. *Thunderbolts\\** is a pleasant surprise in the MCU; it only took a team-up of Marvel\u2019s unlikeliest superheroes to bring it out in them.\n\n[DEADLINE - Pete Hammond](https://deadline.com/2025/04/thunderbolts-review-marvels-fun-supporting-avengers-1236379893/)\n\n&gt;Director Jack Schreier who was imported from the Netflix limited series *Beef,* is more interested in the \u201chuman\u201d elements here than a lot of fancy CGI trickery Marvel has been so fond of in the past, and so there is much to uncover as this group of anti-heroes, not seeing themselves as \u201cheroes\u201d at all, deal with issues of trust, betrayal, and just who they really are. It is a smart and amusing script by Eric Pearson and Joanna Calo an origin story inspired of course by the 1997 comic but quite different and one that could go to intriguing places in future installments and the already announced new editions of the Avengers franchise.\n\n[Independent (UK) - Clarisse Loughrey](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/thunderbolts-review-marvel-florence-pugh-b2740716.html) \\- 4/5\n\n&gt;*Thunderbolts\\** does feel different to what\u2019s come before, not because of those indie credentials, but because it\u2019s the first of its kind to seem genuinely self-aware. We\u2019re repeatedly told that, now the Avengers are gone, the world is lacking in heroes and it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear the old systems don\u2019t work anymore. These are statements that apply equally to Marvel\u2019s frustrated inability to build a new roster post-*Endgame*, since they refuse to stick by anything that isn\u2019t a box office smash (RIP the Eternals), and to the general, hopeless state of our world. *Thunderbolts\\**, in that odd way, might actually then be the ultimate Marvel film for now.\n\n[TIMES (UK) - Kevin Maher](https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/thunderbolts-review-marvel-florence-pugh-c9rldc6f7) \\- 4/5\n\n&gt;In the end the most radical element of this revamped Marvel entry is its suggestion that the problems of the world can\u2019t be solved by a super-powered punch to the face, but by a heartfelt group hug. Sappy and saccharine, perhaps.",
