Is given a very long death scene where they went a little overboard and extra with it, that I was in complete shock where I thought to myself \u201cwow, I know that they want to make this scene look terrifying and haunting, but to give that character such a cruel exit like that was so uncalled for.\u201d\n\nI might\u2019ve felt different about it, if the character was very unlikable and unpleasant but she wasn\u2019t. She actually seemed pretty cool, and really tried her best to make sure she was keeping the kids safe and watching over them while Claire was too busy to spend time with them. \n\nThe worst part is, is that even after she dies, Claire never asks about her whereabouts or mentions ever again.

        "content": "This came to mind after viewing \"Final Destination: Bloodlines\", which not only features Tony Todd in his final role, but which also gives him a deeply moving and memorable farewell onscreen (which they let him write himself no less). As hard as it can be to watch a clearly ill Todd, there's no doubt he's afforded a luxury actors don't always get, a curtain bow worthy of them. Many actors have their final roles in subpar films, either by necessity, choice or cruel fate. (One would think Peter Sellers, had he known his fatal heart attack was coming, would have much preferred \"Being There\" as his final role and not \"The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu.\") There's two in particular, however, who come to mind who really got sent off in grand style.\n\nBurt Lancaster in \"Field of Dreams.\" He did do some TV work afterwards, but Lancaster's turn as Doc \"Moonlight\" Graham was his movie farewell and what a beautiful one it is to see. Namely thanks to his departure into the cornfield accompanied by Ray Liotta's parting words.\n\n\"Hey rookie!...You were good.\"\n\nEdward G. Robinson in \"Soylent Green.\" This one is especially similar to Todd; a terminally ill actor in what he knows is will be his final role gets a grand showcase to say goodbye. Robinson's final act assisted suicide (\"going home\" in the words of the dystopian future society of \"Soylent Green\") is essentially a Viking-style funeral for the legendary actor and highly emotional (helped by co-star Charleton Heston's genuine reaction, who'd been told by Robinson of his terminal condition and thus his tears in that scene are not acting).\n\nAny other examples?",

Antonio Banderas repeating to himself \u201cit\u2019s a man\u2026\u201d while he is mowing down savages dressed as bears alongside a bunch of Vikings while a village burns is just top tier action filmmaking. They just don\u2019t make movies like they used to. I couldn\u2019t name a single other actor in this flick but the whole cast is just draining 3\u2019s from the logo. Not much of a surprise though.

The dude is in his element. \n\n\u201cLo there do I see my mother and my sisters and my brothers. Lo there do I see the line of my people back to the beginning. Lo they do call to me.

She continues to walk through the office and exits frame right and all of a sudden she's in a  fitness class environment and she's wearing workout clothes and so on.   \n  \nI'm just looking for examples of that technique. Any links or suggestions would be helpful.\n\nThank you so much! ",

Nine Inch Nails faces a major challenge because their work can't avoid being compared to the musical legacy Daft Punk left us.\nhich other movies do you think Another movie worth mentioning is Sucker Punch. While not particularly memorable as a film, its music selection is excellent, which, at least for me, often happens with Zack Snyder\u2019s movies.",

        "content": "*The Rock*\u00a0isn't one of my favorite movies, not by a long shot, but besides having some really quotable lines, it has one feature that I'd like to see more of. Ed Harris's Gen. Hummel is a complicated villain who is unequivocally wrong in his actions but simultaneously right in his motives. The sympathetic criminal trope isn't anything new, and it's certainly not unique to\u00a0*The Rock.*\u00a0De Niro's Neal McCauley in\u00a0*Heat*\u00a0is another great example, which\u00a0*is*\u00a0one of my favorite movies. Though calling McCauley the villain is a stretch. Even some comic book films accomplish this to a greater or lesser degree. I'm thinking of Killmonger's death scene on the cliff, watching the sun setting over Wakanda. I don't think enough was done to develop that sympathy over the course of the film, though. It's only in the end that we begin to really sympathize with him. Even though he has some perfectly reasonable criticisms of Western colonialism, it's always framed through the desire to do harm, which doesn't endear him to audiences. It's really my only criticism of\u00a0*Black Panther*. I guess I just like some ambiguity with my villains when I can get it. I also like it when the hero isn't necessarily \"right.\" I'll be honest, I didn't rewatch\u00a0*The Rock*\u00a0before posting this, so maybe my memory is faulty, but I just remember Gen. Hummel as a very complicated, very human character who had seen some shit in his years serving a country that didn't always seem grateful. Who's your favorite complicated villain?",

        "content": "**Ari Aster's 'EDDINGTON' - Review Thread**\n\n* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/eddington)**:** 63% (19 Reviews)\n* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/eddington/)**:** 63 (11 Reviews)\n\nReviews:\n\n[Variety:](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/eddington-review-joaquin-phoenix-pedro-pascal-ari-aster-1236400006/)\n\n&gt;There\u2019s no question that in \u201cEddington\u201d Art Aster makes himself a scalding provocateur, the same way Todd Field did in \u201cT\u00e1r\u201d when he staged the confrontation at Julliard between Cate Blanchett\u2019s Lydia and the BIPOC student who questioned her devotion to dead-white-male composers. Yet as much as nailing down the precise point-of-view of \u201cEddington\u201d is bound to be the subject of numerous incendiary debates, I\u2019d argue that this is very much not a case of Aster becoming some young A24-approved version of David Mamet. What he captures in \u201cEddington\u201d is an entire society \u2014 left, right, and middle \u2014\u00a0spinning out of control, as it spins away from any sense of collective values.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/eddington-movie-review-ari-aster-1235123804/):\n\n&gt;Stemming from a collective sickness to the same degree that \u201cBeau Is Afraid\u201d was born from some very personal trauma, \u201cEddington\u201d \u2014 the tagline for which reads: \u201cHindsight is 2020\u201d \u2014 only wields its\u00a0*what\u2019s the opposite of nostalgia?*\u00a0specificity as a means to an end. It might set the scene with a little \u201cremember how it felt to wait in line outside the pharmacy?\u201d fun, but Aster\u2019s bleakly funny and brilliantly plotted assessment of how fucked we\u2019ve become since then soon leverages those fun memories into a far more probing story about the difficulties of sharing a town between people who live in separate realities.\u00a0\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/05/eddington-review-ari-asters-explosive-satirical-neo-western-takes-a-big-swing-at-maga-culture-cannes-film-festival-1236401277/):\n\n&gt;*Eddington*\u00a0is what you might call a big swing, a film that\u2019s more serious than it first seems, seeing Covid as the Big Bang that landed us right where we are now. It\u2019s about the elephant in the room: the emergent likes of QAnon, 4Chan and the Proud Boys, things that did more damage than Covid ever did, leaving a raw, still-festering wound. Without ceremony or mercy,\u00a0*Eddington*\u00a0rips the Band-Aid off, and not everyone is going to want to look at, or think about, what\u2019s there underneath it.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/eddington-review-cannes-2025-ari-aster-joaquin-phoneix-emma-stone-pedro-pascal/):\n\n&gt;And by way of creative catharsis \u2013 listen, no one was thrilled about 2020 \u2013 \u201cEddington\u201d finds greater charge enacting American carnage than just winking about, but that should come with little surprise. Aster has always had a knack for confrontation, while Phoenix works best as an open-nerve. That the duo should prove so adept tapping into a vein of neurotic action is one of the many brutal surprises in a social satire as blunt and broad as America itself.\n\n[BBC](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250516-eddington-review) (4/5):\n\n&gt;If Beau is Afraid seemed to be about Aster's own fears and neuroses, Eddington is about the more general fears and neuroses of the US in the year 2020. The writer-director puts everything into his blackly comic modern western \u2013 Covid-19 and online conspiracy theories, Black Lives Matter and white privilege, cult leaders and cryptocurrency \u2013 even if he can't quite work out how to weave all of those subjects together. The film would probably have been better if it had been more focused (and shorter), but Aster's deranged vision makes most directors seem timid in comparison.\n\n[The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/eddington-review-cannes-joaquin-phoenix-b2752519.html) (4/5):\n\n&gt;This is Aster\u2019s funniest film to date, and makes use of an ever expanding and shifting cast to dot the 150-minute runtime with well-observed comic details and visual payoffs.\n\n[ScreenDaily:](https://www.screendaily.com/eddington-review-joaquin-phoenix-and-pedro-pascal-face-off-in-ari-asters-wan-satire/5205133.article)\n\n&gt;Without question, the pandemic profoundly transformed an America that was already descending into tribal factions and widespread animosity. But\u00a0*Eddington*\u00a0lacks a clear perspective on that ever-present tragedy, settling instead for cynical observations and a fatal amount of smug self-satisfaction.\n\n[Collider ](https://collider.com/eddington-review/)(8/10):\n\n&gt;Eddington may feel like a step back for Ari Aster in regards to his striking visuals and talent for creating nightmarish viewing experiences. But, if anything, it\u2019s showing that Aster can take these nightmares and show how they can operate in reality.\n\nWritten &amp; Directed by Ari Aster:\n\n&gt;In May of 2020, a standoff between a small-town sheriff (Phoenix) and mayor (Pascal) sparks a powder keg as neighbor is pitted against neighbor in Eddington,\u00a0New Mexico.\n\nCast:\n\n* Joaquin Phoenix\u00a0as Joe Cross, Eddington's sheriff\n* Pedro Pascal\u00a0as Ted Garcia, the town's mayor who is running for reelection\n* Emma Stone\u00a0as Louise Cross, Joe's wife\n* Austin Butler\u00a0as Vernon Jefferson Peak\n* Luke Grimes\u00a0as Guy, an officer at the Eddington sheriff's office\n* Deirdre O'Connell\u00a0as Dawn, Louise's mother\n* Micheal Ward\u00a0as Michael, a young sheriff's trainee\n* Clifton Collins Jr.\u00a0as Lodge\n* William Belleau as Officer Butterfly Jimenez\n* Cameron Mann as Brian\n* Matt Gomez Hidaka as Eric Garcia\n* Am\u00e9lie Hoeferle as Sarah\n* Landall Goolsby as Will\n* Elise Falanga as Nicolette\n* Robert Mark Wallace as Warren",

While some of those do exist, this movie blew me away. \n\nMalkovich as the sleazy corporate guy valuing money over safety was one of the most effortlessly hateable performances I\u2019ve ever seen outside of actual violent, sociopathic villains. \n\nRussell also delivers, with these chilling silent stares throughout the film that perfectly convey his disgust and contempt without saying a word.  \n\nAnd then just when I thought I had seen it all, Mark Wahlberg of all people makes me cry. I can\u2019t remember the last time I cried during a movie. His performance was a total gut punch, every moment authentic, and it\u2019s some of the hands down best acting I\u2019ve seen from him.\n\nMan, what a rush this movie was. Unexpected viewing pleasure. ",

Then it effortlessly transforms into something completely different.\n\nIt's a movie that you can almost close your eyes to, and just *hear* the story.  It's visceral, in a way that's rarely ever shown on screen.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIt's one of those \"acid trips\" of a movie.  Meant to be \"felt\", much more than narrated. It's almost like a fever-dream.\n\nAnyone else here who has seen it?  Don't spoil anything, but I'd love to hear if anyone else appreciates it, the way I do.",

        "content": "I knew about\u00a0*Streets of Fire*\u00a0for years\u2026 came out in the early 80s. Walter Hill, director of\u00a0*The Warriors*\u00a0and\u00a0*48 Hours*, I guess had carte blanche to do his dream project. This movie is wildly fun. Things I noticed...\n\n1. Connections to\u00a0*The Warriors*\u00a0with at least two actors crossing over \u2014 Deborah Van Valkenburgh and the radio DJ from\u00a0*Warriors*. Plus, thematically it has a similar plot thread of the characters needing to get from one turf or area to their own.\n2. The energy is wild... it\u2019s so tight and crisply edited. It has a crazy youthful energy to it.\n3. Way more music than I thought\u2026 I think there were at least 7 songs, not sure how many were original, but that opening song and particularly he finale **Tonight Is What It Means to Be Young\"**\u00a0by\u00a0Fire Inc., written by\u00a0**Jim Steinman**\u00a0who wrote it in 2 days lol... he's the guy behind many of Meat Loaf\u2019s big rock hits... those 2 are bangers. How was that not nominated for an Oscar?\n4. The cast is (mostly) great and they act like they\u2019re hyped up on coke or something... it really works... like they\u2019re really pushing it. Rick Moranis is awesome, and Amy Madigan, Deborah, Diane Lane and Willem Dafoe are so good. Even actors in smaller parts like Bill Paxton.\n5. The set design and costumes \u2014 just over the top. Willem Defoe shirtless in shiny pleather overalls? Amazing!\n6. It takes place in this odd place and time... it\u2019s like the 50s but not. Always raining and dark and moody. Plus, they have music videos and people talk very 80s modern in a noir way.\n7. It\u2019s very short\u2026 like this must have been cut down, because it\u2019s 90 minutes soaking wet and that\u2019s with a lot of music and a 15-minute opening.\n8. And lastly\u2026 when I mention the cast, I left out the lead Michael Par\u00e9. I had heard he\u2019s the dead weight in the film, and OMG, he really is.  I feel bad saying it because I like Par\u00e9, he\u2019s fun in B-movies, but damn, when you see his dead eyes on a big screen and hear that slow sleepy monotone voice compared to the rest of the cast like he's reading his lines, it\u2019s crazy. I don\u2019t get how Hill didn\u2019t recast that after a week of shooting. He\u2019s just so miscast. Par\u00e9 has commented that he was a bit overwhelmed on such a big production and could have used more guidance. Walter Hill is not known for being a communicative director.\n9. This was IMO a very ballsy swing for the fences by Hill and I don't think even if it had a better lead that audience back then would have gone for it.\n\nI\u2019d love to know if anyone else likes this one\u2026",
