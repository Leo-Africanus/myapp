I\u2019m Elizabeth Lo, director-producer-cinematographer of MISTRESS DISPELLER (Venice &amp; TIFF 2024, 20 awards, releasing via Oscilloscope) and STRAY (Indie Spirit nominee 2021). MISTRESS DISPELLER is a documentary about a woman who breaks up affairs in China. It's out in theaters now. Ask me anything!\n\nIn China, a new industry has emerged devoted to helping couples stay married in the face of infidelity. Wang Zhenxi is part of this growing profession and is hired to go undercover and break up affairs by any means necessary; a \u201cmistress dispeller.\u201d Offering strikingly intimate access to a real, unfolding love triangle, Mistress Dispeller documents all sides of what is usually kept behind closed doors. As Teacher Wang attempts to bring a couple back from the edge of crisis, sympathies shift between husband, wife and mistress while emotion, pragmatism and cultural norms collide in this spellbinding look at modern love.\n\n**Trailer:** \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUep-cxvQZo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUep-cxvQZo)\n\nThe film opens in New York on 10/22 and Los Angeles on 10/23 before expanding around the country in the weeks that follow.\n\nAsk me anything! I'll be back later today (Monday 10/20) at 3:00 PM ET to answer questions :)",

        "content": "The Movie itself is pretty good. Not without some issues, but I really appreciate this thing swinging for the fences. One of the most legitimately beautiful films I've seen in some time with some strange editing choices that can't all be easily explained away as stylistic.\n\nIt's divisive for a reason.\n\nThat said... the ending should be one of the least controversial aspects of the film and online criticisms in spaces like this have me wondering if my whole face should be wrapped in a strait jacket.\n\nVAGUE SPOILERS\n\nIf you didn't know that there's supposed to be a follow up film... *maybe* I could understand having pure tonal whiplash. But even then... it's clear the Power Rangers montage wasn't the ending. This was more of a post-credits/epilogue scene further expanding the world.\n\nBut even in the context of the film alone; it earns this supposedly hysterical idea. It's evident from the film itself that there are disperse communities in this post-apocalyptic UK and segregation would engender sociological differences in how they adapt to this hostile world.\n\nThis is Mad Max, post-apocalyptic world-building 101.\n\nThis particular band of roving, Sentai-simulating crazies isn't any more outlandish than an isolated doctor making a tower of babel out of human skulls.\n\nFinding the tone off-putting is one thing (it would likely have worked better as a post-credits scene overall) but I've seen many occasions of people stating that the scene put them off the film and the sequel entirely, which I find to be *completely* mental, personally.\n\nThere are other aspects of the film that I find to be *far* more outlandish than the ending (\"*the magic of the placenta*\"???).\n\nBut maybe it's just me.\n\nDownvote away.",

The screenplay and cinematography are fantastic, the performances are great (though I think Robert Pattinson might have been a miscast), and it\u2019s Timothee Chalamet\u2019s best role to date in my opinion.",

It is one of the most stylistically interesting and entertaining movies I have seen a while - and I\u2019m not just talking about Shakespeare adaptations here, I mean literally out of all movies.\n\nIt oozes phrenetic energy, swagger and sheer style in every single frame. The costumes, the sets, the lighting, the editing - you feel like watching an explosion of overconfident late 90s aura that\u2019s injected directly into your eyeballs.\n\nAnd the acting? I\u2019m just gonna say every single actor knew exactly what kind of film they were in and they deliver appropriately scene chewing performances. With young Leo dicaprio at the height of his twink fame, as well as Claire Danes as Juliet (who we all know has insane chops from her TV outings) - their chemistry is just fantastic. Everyone else in this movie is fantastic too (shout out to Mercurio).\n\nLike this movie might have been seen as over the top when it first came out, but I\u2019m not gonna lie it aged like a fine wine. I feel like it is probably more in tune with pop culture nowadays than it was even in the 90s (I literally wanna wear every single outfit from this movie).\n\nNot to say it\u2019s all just bombastic silliness - some scenes, like the balcony scene, feel genuinely sweet, and oddly ethereal. This movie has such a unique vibe (I honestly feel that euphoria was kinda inspired by it in terms of the atmosphere it manages to create).",

I wanted to spread this awareness because it's too good and I remember it wasnt even top 5 movies when it released on Netflix and neither did it get any award.  \nIt currently holds 97/82% on RT and the plot is basically three estranged daughters reunite to take care of their dying father.  \nThe thing about the movie is that from the very first scene you know it's different and it seems almost like a stage play with it's monologues, you truly get into the person's head. All those actresses did one of the best performance I've seen them do ever, but what I truly love about the film is how comforting it is. With it's fall season theming think of Little Women but more personal and quiter.   \nIt's Fall so I really recommend you check it out because that film really deserved the attention it sadly never got",

        "content": "With Scott's upcoming film, **The Dog Stars**, set to be released in theaters on March 2026, it will be the 30th film of his illustrious 49 year career, going all the way back to 1977. Ever since his directorial debut with **The Duelist**, he has directed some of the most memorable films in history. From the ambitious **Blade Runner** to the terrifying **Alien** to the Oscar-winning **Gladiator**, he has some truly great films in his belt. But ever since the Oscar-winning success of Gladiator, his filmography has been up-and-down. He has directed 18 films in 25 years since Gladiator, which is honestly really impressive, and while some have been good, others have not. **The Martian**, **Kingdom of Heaven** (director's cut), **The Last Duel**, and **Prometheus** (despite fans being divided of the movie) have been some of his best work, showing he has no intention of slowing down, even if he's reaching 90. But throughout that great work, there have been some divisive films at best and downright awful films at worst. **Exodus Gods and Kings** was a whitewashed, historically innacurate mess which fumbles its massive potential of retelling one of the most important stories in history. Same with **Napoleon**, and while it's miles better than Exodus, in terms of basically everything lol (expect accuracy, which Napoleon does a bit better, but it isn't saying much), it really didn't live up to expectations as an epic historical biopic about the French commander. And some others like **Robin Hood**, **The House of Gucci**, ect.\n\nI'm a big fan of his work, and I'm sure a lot of you guys are as well, and there will always be his critics. And the criticism he receives is valid, because every filmmaker isn't perfect. That being said, his legacy is undeniable, having redefined the sci-fi genre with Alien and Blade Runner and the attention to detail in his visual style being influential to a new generation of filmmakers who want to approach that same visual style as Scott. But what do you think? ",

You've got to create this mental and psychological wall do you don't take things personally or get angry and loose or loose your patience.\n\nI loved also the contrast between both personalities!! The desperation of each character but also one is very distant (Adrien) and the other who really cares and love those children.\n\nGovernment doesn't give a shit .. people sees those children as trash .. which makes the job of teachers way heavier.\n\nWhat is your opinion??",

        "content": "So, a few years back (I think after Patricia Arquette\u2019s Oscar for *Boyhood*) I read an article either linked from here or actually from Reddit that had calculated that if you wanted to win an Academy Award your best bet would be to have Ethan Hawke in your film. The irony was that he wouldn\u2019t win one, just actors, directors, writers, etc around him. Obviously it was based on active actors only.\n\nDoes anyone out there have any idea the article or post I remember? I\u2019ve looked, but I can\u2019t find it anywhere.\n\n",

And it got me thinking, what other movies have this type of well-done product placement?\n\nThere's of course Wayne's World, which is the blueprint for comedy product placemente. Kingsman also does agreat job with it\n\nWhat are your opinions on it?",
