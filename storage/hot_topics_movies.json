Meaning where an actor clearly has no motivation for a role other than financial and therefore clearly doesn't care and is barely trying if at all.",
        "content": "Let's be clear; acting is a job and pretty much every actor will have to take roles for financial reasons alone at some point. Charles Dance put it very well here:\n\n\"I've done some appalling films. Junk is absolutely the right word. You do what you can with the stuff you're given. It's a misconception that actors make choices. For all but the most privileged few, the only choice is to work or not to work.\"\n\nBut there's a difference between actors who take those paycheck roles in lackluster or bad films and give it their all or chew up the scenery in entertaining fashion and those who clearly are not even trying. See the 2000 \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\", a terrible film where you have at one end Thora Birch monotonously droning every line and putting in as little effort as possible and at the other end Jeremy Irons (who openly admitted to doing this to pay for his newly acquired castle) tearing through every scene he's in like a mako shark on a cocaine high. You can't get a better example of the extremes of this.\n\nMy personal favorite example of the \"don't care\" approach is Peter O'Toole in the adaptation of Dean Koontz's \"Phantoms.\" Not a bad movie (Affleck is the bomb in it), but one that got a very negative reaction upon release and one you definitely don't expect the likes of O'Toole being in it. Being O'Toole, he isn't bad, but he's obviously putting in minimal effort and his attitude screams, \"Look, I had a bar tab to pay off, sue me.\" It's something I find very entertaining.\n\nYour favorite example?",

Jackson in that movie were one of the many actors that were listed. That answer caught me off guard, cause those were two actors that I'm familiar with, but never in a million years would've guessed that they starred in a movie together but also shared a lot of scenes with each other!\n\nWhen I finally watched it, I was certainly impressed with their on-screen chemistry that I needed to see more of it and was disappointed when I discovered that this is the only movie they've worked on together!   \n  \nThe movie itself was also pretty great, and had amazing action sequences that I find it odd how Geena's character isn't mentioned a lot when the media lists 'badass female protagonists done right!' But Geena and Samuel being such great scene partners is what made this movie stand out to me the most! ",

Realistic portrayals of battles can be interesting when done well, but most directors prefer to go for spectacle.\n\nThe most notable example of this would be 300. They occasionally pay lip service to the importance of military formations, but in practice the Spartans just go out and fight on their own like badasses who each can take on dozens of Persians all on their own.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings movies also often rely on rule of cool for their battle scenes, especially with anything involving Legolas.\n\nIt is also quite common in superhero movies. Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame both end with large armies just charging towards each other and fighting in melee combat, with minimal use of vehicles or long-ranged weaponry.\n\nSo what other movies employ pretty dubious tactics but audiences don't care because it just looks so cool?",

        "title": "Just realised that Christopher Nolan's color pallette is very much influenced by his red-green color blindness",
        "content": "I've heard a few times people say his films look too grey-blue and while Nolan himself has mentioned it has largely to do with his filmmaking style being heavily neo-noir, there was another aspect I didn't know about.\n\nhttps://www.bafta.org/media-centre/press-releases/a-life-in-pictures-christopher-nolan/\n\n&gt;His colour palettes have been influenced by his red-green color blindness.\n\n&gt;CN:\u00a0Well I left the purple up to other people because I\u2019m colour-blind\n\n&gt;EB:\u00a0Not your colour?!.. [Laughs}\n\n&gt;CN:\u00a0No, I can barely see shades of purple, I\u2019m red-green colour-blind, uh so I left that aspect up to Lindy very much. Um, but no it was a tremendous thing to be involved with because Heath didn\u2019t do many films and he would wait a long time between films, as he put it to me he would wait until he felt he needed to go out and do something else, like he really would wait until he was hungry.\n\n\n\nI had no idea about this but it makes a lot of sense for why his films look the way they do - not that I care either way since I find the grey-blue colors and the orange with Oppenheimer quite appealing - but there's an explanation for it beyond just him finding it \"aesthetically pleasing\". It's basically just his natural inclincation. Today I Learned I guess. \n\nAlso a really interesting excerpt from his Memento book about how this influences his movies:\n\n\n&gt;\"It came up while he was filming Memento, in conversation with Guy Pearce, by way of illustrating why everyone seems to take advantage of poor Leonard Shelby's condition. \"If you tell someone you're color-blind, the first thing they do is they show you something and say, 'What color is that?' If you were in a wheelchair, people wouldn't go, 'Oh, you're in a wheelchair. Can you stand up?' It's a bizarre response, but they're fasci- nated because they can't understand that you would see things differently. So they immediately start asking you what do things look like, and then laughing at you as you get it wrong. You see it with Mark Boone Junior's character, the motel clerk, where he's just fascinated by it. As soon as he tells people he can't remember things, then they start to test his memory. It seems cruel. People are fascinated by other people's perception of the world and the way in which it differs. I've always been interested in the tension between the subjective point of view and our faith in an objective reality. In Memento, we dealt with that enormously, particularly at the end, but I think that is in all my films. Whenever I am making a film, I'm constantly being reminded of the paradox of reconciling our subjective views of the world with our deep-seated belief or feeling that there is an objective real- ity outside that is fundamentally unknowable. We can't step outside our own heads-we just can't.\"",
