Still good, still hopeful - but already wrestling with fear, anger, and pride. \n\nYou could see the seeds of his downfall forming:\n\nFlashes of protectiveness turning into aggression\n\nDeep attachment to his mom and Padm\u00e9\n\nResentment toward slavery and the Jedi\u2019s cold detachment\n\nAn early desire to control what he can\u2019t stand to lose\n\n\nIt would\u2019ve made his arc so much smoother - and honestly, more tragic. He\u2019d feel real. The romance in AOTC would also land better, instead of feeling like a weird jump.\n\nLet us see him struggle from the start. That way, the fall actually hurts.",

I decided to go to Facebook and expressed feeling hopeless and heavily implied wanting to take my life. I am sad I did that, and fortunately I am in a much healthier place now.\n\nDuring this time period, for fun I added a bunch of actors as friends who I knew from movies I was a fan of. Being familiar with David Dastmalchian from \"The Dark Knight,\" \"Ant-Man,\" and \"Prisoners,\" I added him and was thrilled to see he actually accepted my request. Anyway, a few hours after my post, David sent an encouraging message letting me know I wasn't alone, that I was supported, and things would get better.\n\nFor an actor like him to decide to reach out to a stranger like me, that meant a lot. Whenever I have seen David appear in a movie since, like \"The Suicide Squad,\" \"Dune,\" \"Blade Runner 2049,\" \"Oppenheimer,\" or \"Late Night with the Devil,\" I just think about how deserved it is. I'm so happy he has had continued success. It is deserved!",

        "content": "\nI\u2019m looking for some \u201cboy power\u201d movies for young boys, preferably animated action movies/series. I want ones that really portray themes of heroism,  bravery, and honorable male characters with healthy masculinity for my 10 year old nephew to look up to. \n\nSome examples are: Lion King, How to Train Your Dragon,  Legend of the Guardians: Owls of Ga\u2019Hoole, Brother Bear, Tarzan, Spirit, Kung Fu Panda, Rise of the Guardians, Ice Age, Kubo and the Two Strings, Avatar the Last Airbender. \n\nI have a lot of them for my younger sisters/nieces (Brave, Mulan, Totally Spies, etc),  but since I wasn\u2019t really interested in \u201cboy\u201d movies growing up, I\u2019m drawing a blank here. Thanks!",

        "title": "'M3GAN 2.0' - Review Thread",
        "content": "*Two years after M3GAN, a marvel of artificial intelligence, went rogue and embarked on a murderous rampage, its creator, Gemma, has become an advocate for government oversight of AI. Unbeknownst to her, a defense contractor has created a military-grade weapon known as Amelia, the ultimate infiltration spy. However, as Emlia's self-awareness increases, it becomes less interested in taking orders. Hoping to stop Emilia, Gemma decides to resurrect M3GAN, making it faster, stronger, and more lethal.*\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [62%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/m3gan_20)\n\n**Metacritic:** [56/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/m3gan-20/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Independent (UK)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/691) \\- [Clarisse Loughrey](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/clarisse-loughrey) \\-  4/5\n\n&gt;M3GAN 2.0 is, admittedly, a pretty bizarre conflagration of tones and ideas. But so were most of the Child\u2019s Play films... and the rollercoaster effect of never quite knowing what genre Johnstone might pull from next is a key part of the fun.\n\n[Empire Magazine - John Nugent](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/m3gan-2/) \\- 4/5\n\n&gt;M3GAN 2.0 is more absurd, self-aware silliness: a riot of timely tech paranoia, with almost no horror but a ton of successful comedy. Slay, queen! We are following *Terminator 2* rules here: if AMELIA is the cold, ruthless, unstoppable T-1000, then M3GAN is the T-800 who can take her on \u2014 the fan-favourite baddie gone good \u2014 with Williams\u2019 Gemma as the tech-sceptical Sarah Connor-type, who must learn to love her former foe. (Because if a M3GAN can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too?)\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - David Rooney](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/m3gan-2-0-review-allison-williams-1236298922/)\n\n&gt;The campy sense of mischief that made Gerard Johnstone\u2019s 2023 hit *M3GAN* so enjoyable asserts itself intermittently in *M3GAN 2.0*, a logical title for a follow-up to the thriller about a murderous robot. But the humor is forced to compete with seriously overcomplicated plotting in a sequel that entangles its horror comedy roots with uninspired espionage elements, becoming a convoluted mishmash with shades of *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*, *Mission: Impossible* and the *Austin Powers* franchise. There are amusing moments reminiscent of the original, but in terms of tone and coherence, the movie loses its way.\n\n[AV Club - Anna McKibbin](https://www.avclub.com/m3gan-2-0-review) \\-  C+\n\n&gt;It seems that Johnstone and his collaborators learned the wrong lesson from *M3GAN*\u2018s shocking success (the original did fairly well in the box office and launched a thousand memes). Audiences weren\u2019t won over by the film\u2019s philosophical untangling of man and tech, but flocked to see M3GAN\u2019s uncanny physicality and unique murder tactics. This was a robot who combined the familiar (bitchy villain dialogue) and unfamiliar (galloping after a child like a dog in a frilly dress). She was Chucky meets *Heathers*. Unfortunately, neither AMELIA, nor this new more morally driven M3GAN, engender that same delighted shock, and so Johnstone settles for the worst of both worlds\u2014something that limps, with exaggerated metal squeaks, into the future.\n\n[DEADLINE - Pete Hammond](https://deadline.com/2025/06/m3gan-2-0-review-sequel-1236441718/)\n\n&gt;With AI and its constant advancements a frightening eal-life prospect that can out-horror any horror film with its evil possibilities, the *M3GAN* franchise, as steroided-up as this sequel is, is fighting against time to remain science fiction instead of being a template for a future documentary\\*.\\* Still it is all a lot of fun to watch, and the filmmakers have met the requirements expected by a sequel designed to outdo its predecessor where *more* becomes the mantra. What made the first film such an instant hit, even in its marketing months before release with that dancing doll image, really can\u2019t be replicated, but this edition is so jacked-up we still can dig it for what it is. All of the players deliver and there is a very amusing supporting turn from none other than Jemaine Clement as an Elon Musk-style tech billionaire named Alton Appleton wanting to take the latest creations from Gemma and company to more questionable heights. Clement delivers some nice laughs as you might expect.",
