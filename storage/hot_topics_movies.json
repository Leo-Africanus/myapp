        "content": "I think it's fair to say Sunshine is a visually gorgeous film and the soundtrack is beautiful as well. The story itself can be interpreted in multiple ways which makes it more interesting.\n\nThe writer of the film, Alex Garland said he \"wrote Sunshine as a film about *atheism*.\"\n\nHe expanded on the subject on the introduction of the *Sunshine* *screenplay*.\n\n\"A crew is en route to a God-like entity: the Sun. The Sun is larger and more powerful than we can imagine. The Sun gave us life, and can take it away.\n\n\"As the crew travel nearer to the Sun, the majesty of the burning star fries their minds. The crew are hypnotized by it, or baffled by it, or driven mad by it. Ultimately, even the most rational crew member is overwhelmed by his sense of wonder and, as he falls into the star, he believes he is touching the face of *God*.\n\n\"The Sun is *God-like*, but not *God*. Not a conscious being. Not a divine architect. And the crew member is only doing what man has always done: making an awestruck category error when confronted with our small place within the vast and neutral scheme of things.\"\n\nThe director, Danny Boyle, had a different approach.\n\n\"The director, Danny Boyle, who is not atheistic in the way that I am, felt differently. He believed that the crew actually were meeting *God*.\n\n\" I didn't see this as a major problem, because the difference in our approach wasn't in conflict with the way in which the story would be told. The two interpretation that could be made from the narrative were the same two interpretations that could be made from the world around us.\"\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this subject?",

        "content": "In Ghostbusters, the fountain scene with Venkman hounding Dana for a date ends with:\n\n**Dana: I\u2019ll see you Thursday.**\n\n**Venkman: I\u2019ll bring the\u00a0Roylance Guide**\u00a0**and we\u2019ll eat and read.**\n\nIt's said so fast, honestly, most people only hear something like \"eat and read.\" But what the hell is Venkman talking about?\n\nIn the original script, \"The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects\" is mentioned in dialog earlier in the movie, akin to mentions of \"Tobin's Spirit Guide.\" Except, famously, GB was largely ad-libbed and reworked scene by scene as they were shooting, and mention of Roylance ended up being dropped. Slight problem: the Dana/Venkman fountain scene was the first shot on the film, so no one had any idea it'd go away.\n\nNot sure why they didn't just re-record the dialog, because a lot had to be anyway due to the fountain noise. In the end, I imagine they just didn't care.\n\nQuick edit for the handful of GB fans for taking this way more seriously than intended: this does not make it a bad movie or a bad scene! It's just a moment where there was supposed to be a callback, only the thing that was being called back to was cut out, so it's up to the audience to fill in the blank. That it still works for you is great! That the vast majority of people can only make out something that sounds like \"roy-lan-sky\" over the sound of the fountain pretty much makes it a non-issue for most. It's just a bit of trivia!",

        "title": "Before the release of The LEGO Movie, what were the initial thoughts at its announcement?",
        "content": "When I saw the first trailer for The LEGO Movie was uploaded, I was 12 years old and very excited to watch it. I mean, yeah, I was very young back then and I think I would have enjoyed it even if it hadn't turned out to be the masterpiece that it ended up being. Plus, it was released just 2 days after my 13th birthday, so it felt like a gift. Anyway, I was excited to see it ever since the first trailer for it dropped.\n\nBut I recently asked myself: How did people react back when the movie was first announced? I'm not saying when the first trailer dropped, but when news outlets reported that a movie about LEGO is in production. \n\nMy kid me would have thought it was excitement, but... thinking like an adult (or someone who is about to turn 24), I think the initial reaction might have been that the movie smelled like a cash grab. Or not like a cash grab, but more like something that, conceptually, doesn't sound like something that would genuinely work, and I can see people back then thinking the movie would purely exist to sell toys. Not to mention that LEGO is considered to be a tool to create your own story and the idea of a definitive story about LEGO sounds absurd on paper. LEGO isn't like Transformers, He-Man, or Thunder Cats where there is a story, or at least some sort of mythos bound to them to create a story out of it. It's mostly like a paper and a pen. That's kinda the reason why the movie based on Minecraft that will launch I think this year is called \"**A** Minecraft Movie\" not \"**THE** Minecraft Movie\"\n\nOf course, The LEGO Movie turned out not just good, but also one of the best animation movies of the first half of 2010s. But I'm still wondering what people thought about it before seeing any footage from the film.",

        "content": "If you're into Formula One, race cars driving, you'll enjoy \"Grand Prix\". The driving scenes, filmed by John Frankenheimmer, are smashing and magnificently shot, every angle in full display and they aren't disappointing for any aficionado. \n\nThe dramatic scenes aren't as effective, be it the love triangle between James Garner, Jessica Walter and Brian Bedford, or Yves Montand and Eva Marie Saint as a married race car driver who begins an affair with a Magazine writer. The highlight being Eva Marie Saint going in hysterics when tragedy dooms. Boy, can Miss Saint throw a screaming fit. \n\nYou also have Antonio Sabato as a young, arrogant driver who hooks up with a permanently bored Fran\u00e7oise Hardy (though she's effortlessly cute). Toshiro Mifune shows up, stern as usual and speaking Japanese.",

        "content": "Ive been on a recent journey of watching classic movies loved by most. As of this I found dead poets society to be on my list of must watch. I\u2019ve just now finished the film and was in love with it minutes in, this film shows a great perspective of young males never having to make their own decisions shown a small glimpse of freedom by a way of words. I\u2019ve seen many arguments on this movie saying that Mr.keating was the cause of Neil\u2019s death and or highly influenced it. I\u2019d have to say from my point of view as a current high school student that Mr keating is a person needed in all young men\u2019s lives. He gives hope and confidence to kids who have never had to make decisions for themselves and would never last in the world if they were to be put out in the real world as they are. I believe Mr keating said all the right things and didn\u2019t make Neil become an actor but inform him on the importance of opportunity and doing what is loved but not expected. Keating never told him to go against his parents but told him to talk to his father in a civil manner. Neil should have never took it to the point he did but that does not make it keiner s fault. I apologize for the rather argumentative post I\u2019d like to hear opinions on this matter further.",

        "content": "Most movie trilogies I have seen (not many, admittedly) have always had movies which felt disconnected - that is, each movies starts and ends its own story, with the movies only being connected slightly. A good example of this is the How To Train Your Dragon trilogy. While nice, I much prefer a single continuous story in my trilogies, such as in the Lord of the Rings trilogy - a single story spanning 3 movies which was intended to be 3 movies from the start. \n\nOne thing which intrigued me when searching for other such movies, was that all of them were adaptations of other properties like books. I was not able to find a single example of a movie trilogy designed as a trilogy from the start, and was an original story. So, do such movie trilogies exist?\n\nPS: Movie series with 4 or more entries are fine too. I'm not mentioning duologies as examples exist such as Kill Bill.",
