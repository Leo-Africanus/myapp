        "content": "Although most of the time Hollywood executives make reasonable decisions, most of which we never know about and we never really give them credit for, they often also do things that we consider to be quite dumb. Sometimes those decisions actually paid off in the end (like the Hobbit being split into 3 movies which ended up being huge box office hits despite their questionable quality) and other times there is at least something resembling an argument for why the decision was made even though many would disagree with it (like WB canning Batgirl and Coyote vs. Acme as a tax write-off, or 20th Century Fox allowing George Lucas to have the Star Wars merchandising rights because at the time merchandising for movies wasn't seen as profitable).\n\nBut sometimes they make decisions so stupid and baffling that you wonder how the hell these people still have jobs. Like why the hell did Sony keep doubling down on their Spider-Man without Spider-Man movie franchise? Venom was a hit, but Venom is Venom, an already popular character. Nobody but big comic book fans or people who watched certain Spider-Man cartoon were aware of who Morbius, Madame Web, or Kraven were. You'd think that the failure of Morbius would have made them reconsider, but nope they instead doubled down by releasing Madame Web and Kraven in the same year, and they flopped just like everyone predicted. The movies were just plain bad, the scripts were terrible, the acting was meme-worthy at best, they made movies about villains but instead turned them into anti-heroes that barely do anything villainous, there was no fun \"popcorn\" spectacle to at least keep audiences interested like with Venom, and the marketing didn't make anyone want to see the movie. Contrary to popular belief, they didn't need to make all of these movies to keep the Spider-man film rights, they did it only because they genuinely believed audiences would go see them. And they could have included Spider-Man in these movies if they'd wanted to, but they chose not to under the belief that it would confuse audiences.\n\nSo what other Hollywood executive decisions do you believe were genuinely stupid ideas?",

The physical media market may be vanishing, but they can still shop for which streaming service will get it.\n\nHorror seems to be the one exception, where a number of less expensive films are made which subsequently lowers the amount required at the box office to be successful.",

        "content": "Frank is only an assoiciate in the mob, a trusted and clealry special associate, but that's all he'd ever be. This is a far more common position than the guys Scorsese has shown in prior mob movies, and Frank's life reflects that. He doesn't have a sugar bowl full of coke in his bedroom, he doesn't own a yacht, his quality of life only marginally improves once he's killing and enforcing for a living. \n\nInstead of Frank's 'protectiveness' for his family being deified in a heroic scene where he beats up the guy who attacked his girlfriend, instead he drags his daughter down to the store so she gets a good look at Frank breaking a guys hand just because he pushed a girl acting up. And of course he can hardly understand why his daughters want nothing to do with him as an old man, it's not just for killing Jimmy Hoffa as they suspect/knew he did, it's because as kids they could never tell him about a teacher who was being unfair or a bully because he'd probably just make them watch as he murdere them. The insane violence that's a part of his career doesn't make him seem strong to his kids, he looks scary and dangerous because he is.\n\nAnd in the end what does his loyalty get him? Does he get what Vito Corleone got, dying peacefully at a ripe age surrounded by family and friends? No, he dies alone and forgotten because he murdered his friend for his boss, and he won't even tell his friend's kids what he did with the body even though there's nobody left to know he snitched. Frank gets a long lonely death because he was too shortsighted and ignorant to stay away from organized crime for his family's sake.",

Perhaps by hyperfocusing upon one aspect or theme of the original? ",

Ive been following Pearce\u2019s career ever since The Count of Monte Cristo and Memento and so him being in discussion for Supporting Actor this year is just cool. His collaborations with John Hillcoat are absolutely brilliant. Although I havent watched The Brutalist yet, I\u2019m very intrigued now and will definitely watch out for it.\n\nWith this, what is your favorite role of his and favorite film?\n\nJust check out some of his filmography which showcases his range: \n- The Proposition (Him and John Hillcoat are magic)\n- Rover \n- Priscilla Queen of the Desert\n- LA Confidential\n- Memento\n- The Count of Monte Cristo\n- Animal Kingdom\n- The Time Machine\n- A Slipping Down Life\n- The Road\n- King\u2019s Speech\n\n\n",
