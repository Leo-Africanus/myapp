        "content": "Yes, I know you cinephiles will say that Quentin, Chris Nolan, or PTA should be in this discussion too. But I'm here to make the case for someone whose early career run is arguably unmatched: **Rob Reiner**.\n\nJust look at this incredible string of films:\n\n* **This Is Spinal Tap** (1984): His very first movie and a genre-defining masterpiece. It single-handedly created the mockumentary genre and is one of the funniest films ever made. Reiner and his team so perfectly lampooned rock documentaries that the genre was never quite the same.\n* **The Sure Thing** (1985): A great pivot with a solid, early John Cusack performance.\n* **Stand By Me** (1986): A true classic and many people's pick for the best coming-of-age movie of all time.\n* **The Princess Bride** (1987): A fantasy-comedy-romance that is so widely beloved it's still quoted and celebrated today.\n* **When Harry Met Sally...** (1989): Considered by many to be the greatest romantic comedy ever made.\n* **Misery** (1990): A perfect, chilling adaptation of the Stephen King novel. It's a shocking turn from rom-com to horror that few directors could pull off.\n* **A Few Good Men** (1992): An iconic military courtroom drama, with some of the most memorable lines in film history.\n\nAfter this run, his filmography definitely cools down, but that initial stretch of seven films is an unbelievable display of versatility and skill. From mockumentary to horror to rom-com, what other director has put together a run like that?",

        "content": "Both are \"wacky summer vacation\" movies that succeed in no small part thanks to Candy's presence (among his many other talents, the man was just perfect at playing the beleaguered family man). Personally, I prefer \"The Great Outdoors\", not just because it gives Candy a better foil with Dan Aykroyd, but because it perfectly captures the look and feel of a vacation in the Midwest, specifically WI/MN at a lake. When Candy and Aykroyd are sitting on the cabin deck looking out at the lake, I want to be there with them. And then we get my favorite exchange in the movie.\n\n\"I see the underdeveloped resources of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan, a consortium exploiting over a billion dollars in forest products. I see a paper mill and a mining operation, a green belt between lakeside condos and a waste management facility focusing on the newest rage in waste: Medical refuse. Infected bandages, body parts, IV tubing, syringes, fluid, blood, radioactive waste, all safely contained, sunken in the lake and sealed for centuries. I ask you, what do you see?\"\n\n\"I..I just see trees.\"\n\nYour preference?",

The physical acting and the voice work feels so much less expressive and animated (as in lively). In the same vein, I remember watching a scene from the Lion King remake and thinking Timon and Pumbaa were just so boring. Where was all of their signature flare? Especially Timon. In the cartoon that Meerkat just oozed charisma, and in the remake he felt super flat.\n\nCalling these performances phoned-in feels harsh, but I honestly don't know what else to call them. These entire movies feel phoned-in, and the worst part is that I know a lot of people worked really hard on them.\n\nI know a lot of these have writing and story differences (*ahem* Lilo and Stitch), but even with a shot-for-shot adaptation like HTTYD, it feels like the same movie, but worse.\n\nSomeone explain this to me.",

        "content": "I'm trying to compile a list of foreign movies that made a mark on American audience, so that I can watch them over the next few months. I define \"foreign\" movie to be any movie that is not made in English AND either has a predominantly non-American cast or predominantly non-American storyline. I guess British or Canadian movies aren't quite \"foreign\" enough in that sense \ud83d\ude03.\n\nI'm Asian but I have been living in the West for the last 18 years, including about 10 years in the US. As a lifelong fan of Hollywood and foreign movies, I'm trying to understand what made some foreign movies resonate with American audience. So far, I have the following in my list:\n\n1. Parasite (Korea)\n2. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (China/Taiwan)\n3. Am\u00e9lie (France)\n4. Life is Beautiful (Italy)\n5. City of God (Brazil)\n6. Lola Rennt / Run Lola Run (Germany)\n7. Slumdog Millionnaire (India)\n8. All About My Mother (Spain)\n9. Cinema Paradiso (Italy)\n10. Train to Busan (Korea)\n11. Pan's Labyrinth (Spain)\n12. La Dolce Vita (Italy)\n13. Godzilla (Japan)\n14. The Hunt (Denmark/Sweden)\n15. The Lunchbox (India)\n16. The Lives of Others (Germany)\n17. Rashomon (Japan)\n18. Volver (Spain)\n19. Y Tu Mama Tambien (Mexico)\n20. No Man's Land (Bosnia and Herzegovina)\n\nPlease recommend more! I'm generally up for watching many different genres. Thanks in advance! \ud83d\ude4f",

        "content": "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty opens with the main protagonist (played by Ben Stiller) using E-Harmony, and a scene later, he's on the phone with a company rep (played by Patton Oswald) who says a line about E-Harmony mentioning their \"matching algorithm\" making them different than other dating sites, where Stiller's character replies \"Yeah, that's what I like about you guys.\"\n\nThe movie also says the company name \"Papa John's\" no less than 7 or so times.\n\nAnd at the end, when Adam Scott's character is asked what Life's motto is, he replies, \"Life... I'm lovin' it?\" to which Stiller's says \"That's McDonald's.\"\n\nWhat other examples of obvious, shameless, eye-roll inducing product placements in movies can you think of?",

        "content": "I was wondering if the movie/TV buffs out there could help me with a lifelong pursuit of mine: do you know any movies or TV series that focus on society finding the first cases of a virus and for a significant amount of the time, the focus is on society collapsing piece by piece instead of fast forwarding to full apocalypse.\n\nFear of the Living Dead PROMISED to do that and did it for three episodes. I was so mad I stopped watching. Now, I judge Zombie content based on how fast the apocalypse comes. Make it a drinking game. Say, I will drink this whole bottle from first bite to full apocalypse.\n\nRIP YOU.\n\nPlease help me with suggestions \nLove you.\n\n",
