        "content": "This movie wasn\u2019t supposed to surprise me. The ending was spoiled for me long before I even hit play nd to make it worse i had already seen a few key shots on YouTube so going in I thought, 'What is left to enjoy?' Turns out , everything lol\nEven knowing the outcome, this movie hooked me in ways I didn\u2019t expect. It is not about what happens it is about how it happens. Watching these 12 strangers argue ,clash nd unravel felt like seeing raw human nature laid bare. Their biases , egos nd frustrations it ia all so uncomfortably real nd that is where the brilliance lies !!\nThe cinematography blew me away. At first, the camera looks down on the jurors like we are judging them from a distance but as the movie progresses the angles shift. The room feels tighter ,the shots get closer nd by the end, we are looking up at these men. It is subtle but genius without saying a word , Sidney Lumet forces us to respect them , to understand that justice requires effort, humility nd courage.\nSpeaking of Lumet how is this his debut feature film? The man came in swinging. His ability to pull such distinct layeered performances from his cast is ridiculous. Every juror feels so real like you kinda have met them before lol tthe stubborn one , the quiet one , the loud one who doesn\u2019t shut up etc ..nd yet, together, they form this chaotic but gripping puzzle. Lumet doesn\u2019t overdo anything like he keeps it simple , letting the dialogue nd performances do all the heavy lifting lol . As much as I loved the movie , it doesn\u2019t quite fit the intensity I usually crave in films. Don\u2019t get me wrong this is smart, layered nd almost flawless but it is more cerebral than emotional ,I honestly didn\u2019t feel gutted by it the way I do with darker nd more tragic stories. It challenged me sure but it didn\u2019t hit as hard as I expected\nAnyway even spoiled, 12 Angry Men is a masterclass in filmmaking nd that is how you know it is a damn good film",

        "content": "Director: Alex Garland/Ray Mendoza\n\nCast: Will Poulter, Kit Connor, Joseph Quinn, Cosmo Jarvis, Charles Melton, Noah Centineo, D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Evan Holtzman, Finn Bennett\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [93%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/warfare)\n\n**Metacritic:** [78/100 ](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/warfare/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/226) \\- [David Ehrlich](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/david-ehrlich) \\- B-\n\n&gt;\u201cWarfare\u201d is a film that wants to be felt more than interpreted, but it doesn\u2019t make any sense to me as an invitation \u2014\u00a0only as a warning created from the wounds of a memory. The film is a clear love letter to Elliot Miller and the other men in Mendoza\u2019s unit, but the verisimilitude with which it recreates the worst day of their lives \u2014 when measured against the ambiguity as to what it hopes to achieve by doing so \u2014 ultimately makes \u201cWarfare\u201d seem like a natural evolution of Garland\u2019s previous work, so much of which has hinged on the belief that our history as a species (and, more recently, America\u2019s self-image as a country) is shaped by the limits of our imagination.\u00a0\n\n[San Francisco Chronicle](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/402) \\- [G. Allen Johnson](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/g-allen-johnson) \\- 4/4\n\n&gt;Garland has become this generation\u2019s Oliver Stone, a studio filmmaker who is able to fearlessly capture the zeitgeist on hot-button issues few other Hollywood filmmakers touch, such as AI (2015\u2019s \u201cEx Machina\u201d), the political divide and a society\u2019s slide toward violence (\u201cCivil War\u201d), and now the consequences of military diplomacy.\n\n[Empire Magazine](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/148) \\- [Alex Godfrey](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/alex-godfrey) \\- 5/5\n\n&gt;War is hell, and Warfare refuses to shy away from it. Free of the operatics of most supposed anti-war films, it\u2019s all the more effective for its simplicity. It is respectfully gruelling.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/213) \\- [David Rooney](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/david-rooney)\n\n&gt;Garland is working in peak form and with dazzling technical command in what\u2019s arguably his best film since his debut, *Ex Machina*. But the director\u2019s skill with the compressed narrative would be nothing without the rigorous sense of authenticity and first-hand tactical knowledge that Mendoza brings to the material \u2014 and no doubt to the commitment of the actors.\n\n[AV Club](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/833) \\- [Brianna Zigler](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/brianna-zigler) \\- B+\n\n&gt;Simply depicting the plain, ugly truth of human combat makes *Warfare* all the more effective as a piece of art setting out to evoke a time and place. The bombing set piece is equal parts horrific and thrilling; the filmmakers draw out the sensory reality of the slaughter as the men slowly come to, disoriented, ears ringing, ultimately leading to a frenzy of confusion, agita, and howling agony. The cacophony of torment and its reaction in the men meant to arrive with help is as grim as the bureaucratic resistance to send in medic vehicles to give the wounded any chance to survive their injuries.\n\n[Independent (UK)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/691) \\- [Clarisse Loughrey](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/clarisse-loughrey) \\- 3/5\n\n&gt;Alex Garland has now constructed what could be called his trilogy of violence... Warfare, at least, is the most successful of the three, because its myopia is a crucial part of its structure. Garland and Mendoza do, at least in this instance, make careful, considerate use of the film\u2019s framework. We\u2019re shown how US soldiers invade the home of an Iraqi family who, for the rest of *Warfare*\u2019s duration, are held hostage in a downstairs bedroom, guns routinely thrust into their faces. In its final scene, they reemerge into the rubble of what was once their home, their lives upended by US forces and then abandoned without a second thought. It\u2019s quite the metaphor.\n\n[Daily Telegraph (UK)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/921) \\- [Robbie Collin](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/robbie-collin) \\- 5/5\n\n&gt;It\u2019s necessarily less sweeping than Garland\u2019s recent Civil War, and for all its fire and fury plays as something of a philosophical B-side to that bigger earlier film. I\u2019d certainly be uncomfortable calling it an action movie, even though vast tracts of it are nothing but. It leaves questions ringing in your ears as well as gunfire.\n\n[Guardian](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/205) \\- [Peter Bradshaw](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/peter-bradshaw) \\- 3/5\n\n&gt;In some ways, Warfare is like the rash of war-on-terror pictures that appeared 20 years ago, such as Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s The Hurt Locker or Nick Broomfield\u2019s Battle for Haditha, or indeed Brian De Palma\u2019s interesting, underrated film Redacted. But Warfare doesn\u2019t have the anti-war reflex and is almost fierce in its indifference to political or historical context, the resource that should be more readily available two decades on. The movie is its own show of force in some ways, surely accurate in showing what the soldiers did, moment by moment, though blandly unaware of a point or a meaning beyond the horror.\n\n[Times (UK)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/823) \\- [Kevin Maher](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/kevin-maher) \\- 5/5\n\n&gt;This is a movie that\u2019s as difficult to watch as it is to forget. It\u2019s a sensory blitz, a percussive nightmare and a relentless assault on the soul.\n\n[Deadline](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2256) \\- [Gregory Nussen](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/gregory-nussen)\n\n&gt;While it aims for an unromantic portrait of combat, it can only conceive of doing so through haptic recreation in lieu of actual characterization. The result is a cacophonous temper tantrum, a vacuous and perfidious advertisement for military recruitment.\n\n[London Evening Standard](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/446) \\- [Martin Robinson](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/martin-robinson) \\- 4/5\n\n&gt;Given all the America First stuff going on, and the history of the Iraq War, Warfare may suffer from a lack of sympathy for American military operations. And yet, the sheer technical brilliance and strength of performances, cannot fail to connect when you take on the film on its own terms, as pure human experience in the most hellish of circumstances.",

Looking for chain of events sequences, comedic, dramatic, or otherwise.... I can think of one other but I'm hoping the reddit community can identify more. Thanks!",

        "content": "There's a famous quote attributed to anthropologist Margaret Mead that the first sign of civilization in archaeology is a healed bone because anywhere else in the animal kingdom a broken bone is a death sentence and only humans working together had the ability to reset the bone and care for the individual while it healed.\n\nWe know that when Chigurh gets hurt he'll steal medical supplies and tend to himself. But a snapped arm bone can't really be treated like this and whatever he could do he'd still be left crippled to a point where he's unable to to do the only job he's capable of. Without going to a hospital he'd no longer useful to his employers.  \n\nI don't know if any of this is a part of McArthur's intention. I've seen the interpretation that it's symbolic of the brutality inherent to the world that not even he can escape. But no one else in the story is so acutely vulnerable to this situation as he is; a man who is violently anti-social and entirely self-reliant presented with a situation that requires the willing help of others. And this vulnerability is highlighted by the lengths and pains he has to go to heal a much less serious wound. \n\nTo put it in his terms: if he had been more like his victims, following the rules of society, then those rules would have in fact been of great use to him in that moment. And now it's his own rules that could be said to have ultimately failed him.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention he\u2019s a very distinct looking person, wanted for murder, on foot, walking away from a crime scene less than a mile away with a bone sticking out of his arm.",

Mr. Grey becoming more open and learning that it\u2019s okay to be a sadist and enjoy it with someone. Helping lee discover herself and letting her discover more about himself. I have looked and it\u2019s a decently underground movie so I haven\u2019t found anyone to truly talk to about it or to recommend movies where the two main characters matched each others freak perfectly. What other movies are like this and I\u2019ve already seen James spaders big three so those are off the table already. So what movies are like secretary?",
