This film is a classic and one of the funniest films I have ever seen. A lot of absolutely hilarious gags that will make you die of laughter. It\u2019s got a good cast as well Robert Hays, Julie Hagerty as Ted and Elaine who met during the war and Ted gets on the flight to win back Elaine. You also have Kareem Abdul-Jabar who is the first officer pilot on the plane. Peter Graves plays the captain of the plane, Leslie Nielsen is a Dr. on the flight and Robert Stack as Captain Rex Kramer. If you haven\u2019t seen the film highly would recommend it.",

I\u2019m looking for something with a similar vibe, could be live action or anime, doesn\u2019t matter too much to me. It doesn\u2019t even have to be entirely like either one of those two as long as it has the same sort of neon-dystopia feeling to it (like Tron)",

        "content": "I watched Taxi Driver on the ABC Sunday Night Movie in 1978 and it blew my 12-year-old mind. For an emotionally impressionable kid, who\u2019s still\nlearning to regulate emotions and understand complex feelings like alienation, despair, and moral ambiguity, it was a psychological rollercoaster ride.\n\nIt was more than just a dark film\u2014it was psychologically immersive. The score, the cinematography, the voiceover\u2014all draw you into Travis' mental space. When you're that young, the emotional residue of a film like this can \"stick,\" becoming a reference point for how you interpret intense feelings later in life.\n\nThrow in my lifelong appreciation for firearms and target shooting ( my father was a career Army drill instructor and military police officer) and I see how easily the slow, close-up pan over Easy Andy\u2019s wares was so fascinating to watch. I had seen hundreds of films up to that point, but I\u2019d never seen a camera used that way. It was close enough to read the tiny etching on the pistols. \n\nNeedless to say, I didn\u2019t go the John Hinckley route(lol), but the film left an indelible cinematic impression. And although still a pre-teen, I felt a profound sadness for Travis\u2019 isolation, rejection, and despair- in spite of his sociopathic behavior.\n\nCurious to hear about others\u2019 recollections of movies that \u201clinger\u201d for a lifetime.\n",

Obviously I love rewatching movies because I\u2019m able to find new ways to appreciate them but there\u2019s just something about a first time viewing experience that\u2019s hard to replicate. For example, I would love to wipe my memory of the Saw franchise and watch the ending of the first movie again. I love when a movie absolutely shocks me like that. It\u2019s just so much fun. ",
