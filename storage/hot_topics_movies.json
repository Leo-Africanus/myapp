It\u2019s a beautiful love story above all but you\u2019ll have some laughs. I\u2019m a fan of Kyle Gallner and think he\u2019s a great actor (not to mention hot af)\n\nUnderrated movie. Worth the watch.",

The shots of the buildings are beautiful, Erik\u2019s costume getting progressively more fucked as the movie goes on is sick, the start after Erik is revived being super like disorienting is also really cool. This movie is just so goth it makes me happy and I can really see how it influenced a lot of early 2000s movies. Gonna watch Over The Hedge now",
