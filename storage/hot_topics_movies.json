He has directed projects for Adult Swim, Disney, HBO Max, and Cartoon Network. He is also well-known for his cult hit video game ART SQOOL and his 3D illustrations, which appear frequently in the New York Times and NewYorker.

He's best known for the surrealist educational content he makes for NPR on their Planet Money TikTok account. He graduated from Ohio State University in 2019 with a film studies degree, interned at NPR\u2019s Tiny Desk, but really found his stride with the chaotic &amp; crudely animated videos that earned him a Murrow award in 2023.\n\nAsk us anything!

That wasn\u2019t my take away from the movie though. I felt it was a tremendous amount of women empowerment with no filter. I told myself I needed to rewatch it because I feel like I might\u2019ve missed a few things. I loved it mostly because it made my brain itch and think and it struck emotions that I wasn\u2019t expecting. What were your thought when you watched the movie and would you recommend it to others? Did it make you feel strongly or completely uncomfortable? ",

        "content": "I was browsing Fandango and found that the Cinemark and Regal theaters near me have listed their opening day (8/7) shows for WEAPONS at 2:17PM, in reference to the inciting event of the film which shows a group of children leaving their homes at exactly 2:17AM. Such a wonderfully bizarre marketing tactic to see movie showtimes that don't end in 5 or 0.\n\nThe middle of a Thursday is a hard sell for the 9-to-5 drones among us, but I can't say I'm not tempted lol. I'm definitely seeing it either way. Do y'all have any of these showing up near you?",

You know, you just [sic]. In those days, maybe in these days, too, you just give away everything. All they [sic]. They [Paramount] own the IP for everything, so they can do what they want.

        "content": "For me The Naked Gun Trilogy has only one really funny &amp; good movie but apart from that it's just a series of diminishing returns. Police Squad is the superior version of what Naked Gun wanted to be like really it's jokes, gags &amp; sight gags as much more funny &amp; better than the movies. I'll give the movies this credit they do work standalone despite being a spin off of Police squad, however I don't know man it seems like the fact they were restrained because of Network censorship the show had to be clever &amp; actually put effort into being a specific parody rather than just pointless references. \n\nOn another note it seems like the diminishing returns of The Naked Gun Trilogy as well as Spy hard with their heavy reliance on pointless pop culture references really foreshadowed the type of Parody movie we were about to get.\n\nThat's my thoughts tell me yours because I really wanted to discuss it.",

        "content": "Wow, I am so glad I saw this. I watched the trailer before and I was throughly confused what the movie was even about, but the YouTube comments said it was a great movie and so I took a chance on it. Man, they were absolutely right.\n\nThere's so much to talk about here, but just a few:\n\nI think it's really interesting that (as far as I remember?) Agnes herself never says out loud she was assaulted (nor did Lydia). The two had the conversation and the implication tacitly passed between them (Lydia saying something along the lines of \"it's what you think, I'm sorry\"). This comes around again in the jury selection scene where she alludes to what happened to her and it wordlessly passes between them. In both cases, this is an interesting bit of unity through real understanding, and I think it quite strongly contrasts with the inauthentic attempt at unity (and, by extension, understanding) by the two women at the university (\"we're both women so, you know, we understand\").\n\nI also loved the awkward dialogue between characters. Sometimes awkward dialogue comes from bad writing, but here it was so perfectly intentional and real. The non-sequiturs, the failed jokes, the pauses of confusion, and the general inability to verbally communicate (which I think is a common theme in the movie) all came together to make the characters feel all the more real.\n\nAnd, lastly, despite the brutally bleak story, the movie still had me laughing and smiling too. I loved Agnes trying to hide the cat in the grocery store :)",
