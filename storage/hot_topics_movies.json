        "content": "I watched the LOTR trilogy this past weekend, and as is pretty common with the Fathom Events, there was a little bit before the movie started.  This time it was a little off-the-cuff monologue by Peter Jackson.\n\nWow; I know it's been 25 years, but he looked... rough.  He was having a hard time keeping a train of thought going, and in the intro to ROTK, he mentioned that after the Hobbit movies were finished, his go-to Director of Photography died of a heart attack, and that caused to have a real lack of motivation to make more movies (besides documentaries from existing footage.) He was both personally affected by the death, and he wasn't looking forward to learning to collaborate with a new DP.\n\nI hope he's okay, and that this was just not a good day for him to film some obligatory chit-chat.\n\n(Though he did have some cute little anecdotes, like how when he would visit Christopher Lee in England, his wife would hand over a bottle of potent booze to the two of them before heading out for the evening, and they'd get hammered while Peter got to learn all kinds of interesting stuff about Christopher Lee's time in horror movies.)",

        "content": "Just finished The Prestige and damn my brain is spinning. I went in thinking it\u2019s just two rival magicians trying to outsmart each other. But nah, this movie is way twisty..  \n\n\nThe biggest shock for me was Borden being two people. Alfred and Fallon were twins the whole time, living one life as one man. That\u2019s why sometimes he is loving and sometimes cold. Sometimes he cares for his wife and sometimes he feels like a stranger. They literally destroyed their personal lives just to protect one magic trick. That\u2019s crazy dedication.\nThen Angier\u2026 this part really messed me up. I thought he finally used a double. But no, Tesla\u2019s machine was real. It was cloning him. Every single show, one Angier survives and the other one dies in the tank. He never even knows if he will be the man who lives or the man who drowns. He keeps killing himself again and again just to win. That is straight up disturbing.\n\nThen I realized the opening murder wasn\u2019t even normal murder. Angier planned his own death to frame Borden. He sacrificed himself just to destroy his enemy. That\u2019s how deep his obsession went.\nThe ending hurt. One Angier is drowning in the tank and the other is bleeding on the floor. No winners at all. Just two broken men who ruined their lives for obsession.",

        "title": "Examples of anti-Chekhov's guns?",
        "content": "A rule of thumb for playwrights is that any significant story element introduced early in the play should have some sort of payoff before the play ends. If you introduce a gun in act one of a three act play, it better go off in act three or it was an extraneous detail that should be excised from the script. The same rule is often applied to movies as well.\n\nMy question is what examples of an anti-Chekhov gun are there: not just a plot device that has no payoff but a plot device that is introduced and subsequently works in a way antithetical to the way the movie explains. Basically how many movies lie to the audience.\n\nTwo examples come to mind: in Jurassic Park, it's shown early on that the t-rexes are so massive that their footsteps can be heard from far away and shake the ground but later in the climax, a T-Rex seemingly appears out of nowhere with no warning. In Ant Man, it's explained that items that are shrunk down maintain their mass, that's why a punch from a microscopic Ant Man packs the punch of a full grown adult yet we see later in the movie that Hank Pym is carrying around a shrunk down tank that should way thousands of pounds on a keychain.",

I get the feeling it sort of expanded his vocabulary a little.\n\nHe asked me what the first R-rated movie I ever watched was, and I can\u2019t remember for sure, but it was probably The Terminator. I definitely wasn\u2019t old enough when I watched it. I have these really vivid memories of watching it with friends in some dark room, feeling both exhilarated and deeply anxious the entire time. That eye surgery scene was freaky, and the factory scene at the end when the Terminator is just a metal skeleton gave me nightmares.\n\nStill, I remember being so glad I\u2019d seen it. I didn\u2019t know movies could do that, could make you feel such intense fear, excitement, and awe. Just felt like some of a revelation.

        "content": "Watched The Life of Chuck last night and absolutely loved it. Mike Flanagan is one of my favorite directors and seeing him get to do something a bit different from his usual thing but that still had all his signature commentary on life/death was so cool.\n\nThere\u2019s one detail I\u2019ve been chewing on and I wanted to see what other people thought. At one point, Chuck\u2019s grandfather Alfie brings up A Christmas Carol. It doesn\u2019t seem like this would just be a random reference as most pieces of dialogue called back to something else in the movie. \n\nMy thought is: is each chapter one of the \u201cvisits from the spirits\u201d, but told backwards? Starting with \u201cyet to come\u201d (the future he\u2019s shown that shapes him to commit to living his life fully), the present, then the past? ",

        "content": "I get that production on this elite film was INSANE and basically no other hybrid film like that could match it. But why, in nearly 40 years, has nearly no studio greenlit something similar? Is it because Cool World bombed colossally? Literally the only examples I can think of after that are Looney Tunes: Back in Action, and the upcoming Coyote vs. Acme. (Space Jam doesn't really count in this way, it only has two scenes that blend 2D characters into a 3D world) I mean, sure, theatrical hand-drawn animation in the West is on life support, but  Coyote vs Acme had to be dragged out the doldrums to even be released!",

        "content": "In recent years especially, actors are starring in more and more films wherein they play two or more roles. Alto Knights, Sinners, Mickey 17, etc. I used to think it was something only comedic actors would pursue since it requires suspending disbelief and it plays better when the characters are ridiculous: Mike Myers\u2019 and Eddie Murphy\u2019s works.\n\nBut when the acting is more dramatic it works too: Legend, Us. What\u2019s your favorite from any genre? I\u2019m voting Sinners.",
