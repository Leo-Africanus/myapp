        "content": "Hey r/movies! We're Anna Maguire &amp; Kyle Greenberg, a British-Canadian-American filmmaking duo behind HI! YOU ARE CURRENTLY BEING RECORDED (2024), the dog-friendly screening series and zine CANNES DOGS, underground one-day Vancouver film festival OFF-VIFF and the new FRENCH LESSONS (2025). \n\nAfter visiting one of LA's \"Valley\" neighborhoods for a period of time (and enjoying a joint or two), Anna and I began to feel the menacing reality of surveillance cameras not only surrounding us, but speaking to us and were compelled to make a short film about it called HI! YOU ARE CURRENTLY BEING RECORDED.\n\nThe short played over two dozen festivals across the globe like Fantasia, Morbido, SXSW Sydney, but as we started to approach the digital release, we knew it was important to do something different than just simply throw the film up on Vimeo or YouTube. Instead, we've decided to create a never-ending surveillance loop where the film could live online in a new form: [hiyouarecurrentlybeingrecorded.com](http://hiyouarecurrentlybeingrecorded.com)\n\nAsk us anything! We'll be back Thursday 5/8 at 6:00 PM ET to answer your questions.\n\nWatch HI! YOU ARE CURRENTLY BEING RECORDED online as part of the ENDLESS LOOP today for free - \n\n[hiyouarecurrentlybeingrecorded.com](http://hiyouarecurrentlybeingrecorded.com)\n\nTeaser Trailer\n\n[https://vimeo.com/1019440725](https://vimeo.com/1019440725)\n\nSynopsis: On a trip to Los Angeles to visit a new flame, Anna finds herself lost, stoned and alone\u2026 or is she?",

        "title": "I finally watched \"Grave of the Fireflies,\" and I am devastated.  It is one of the few movies I have watched that lived up to what people promised it was.",
        "content": "Just watched *Grave of the Fireflies* for the first time. I went in knowing it had a reputation for being devastating, but even then, nothing could\u2019ve prepared me for how emotionally brutal it is. It\u2019s not just unrelentingly sad... it\u2019s an unflinching portrait of the horrors of war, not actually through battles or explosions, but through starvation, isolation, and the quiet, slow loss of innocence.\n\nWhat really hit me was how personal it all felt. This wasn\u2019t just a tragedy of circumstance, but it was also a tragedy of pride. Seita\u2019s decision to leave the relative safety of his aunt\u2019s home wasn\u2019t just impulsive; it was fatal. I understand he was a child trying to protect his sister and preserve their dignity, but in trying to shield her from cruelty, he ultimately exposed her to a much worse fate. His pride wasn\u2019t villainous, but it was misplaced, and it cost them everything.\n\nWatching Setsuko deteriorate, not just physically but emotionally, was agonizing. She never had a chance to truly understand what was happening. Her firefly funeral is one of the most haunting and bittersweet scenes I\u2019ve ever seen in animation. Her ashes... the scene was so beautiful yet completely gutting. It really drove home how war erases childhood, not just through violence, but through neglect and abandonment.\n\nThis film doesn't try to make a statement so much as show you the raw, human cost of war. It\u2019s not cathartic. It doesn\u2019t offer hope or redemption. It just leaves you with silence, and maybe that\u2019s the point. Because some losses don\u2019t have meaning. They\u2019re just gone.\n\nIf anyone ever tells you animation can\u2019t be serious art, show them *Grave of the Fireflies*. It broke me and I think that\u2019s exactly what it was meant to do.",

As dark as moat of the movies ive seen, Requiem for a Dream is completely unsettling. It is meant to be. The score is incredible. The use of sounds to create unnerving feelings is powerful. The split screen and use of disturbing images really sets the tone for the absolute nightmare of addiction.\n\nThe movie feels like a made for after school documentary but just keeps descending into a pit of hell.\n\nThe mother character made me feel sorry as a son and decent human for an elderly woman. Fearful of how I would be vulnerable as I got older.\n\nLetos absolutely depraved character shows what a selfish and self destructive person will do to get to where they think they want to be. At any means necessary.\n\nConnellys character made me hyper aware of women in compromising relationships and the absolutely disgusting behavior of people who wish to exploit it.\n\nWayans character shows what a man with some promise and a dream can be horrifically compromised. \n\nThis is a film that should be required viewing for high schoolers to show the horrors of addiction. Addictions to everything. Drugs, alcohol, sex, TV, Weightloss, food, public opinion, peer pressure, self esteem, sex work... ",

It could be a movie that made you sit back and question the meaning of life or a shocking twist you want to experience for first time again. \n\nMy pick fits into the latter category, Identity (2003). Probably one of the most unexpected and well executed twists I\u2019ve ever seen.",

I miss filmmakers like this, he started as an actor who was mostly in supporting roles and inch by inch became an A List director with Ghandi and then became John Hammond who welcomed everyone to Jurassic Park. It's an insane career and they don't really make filmmakers like him anymore. ",
