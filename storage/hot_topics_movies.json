        "title": "January 24-26 Box Office Recap: In a very quiet weekend, 'Flight Risk' tops the box office, but poor reviews and word of mouth will prevent it from holding well. 'Presence' has an okay start in 1,750 theaters, while 'Brave the Dark' flops outside the Top 10.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/hjr42iwe3mfe1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bea2ede539c39f9000b3f9661915c8e54fee033\n\nIn one of the quietest weekends (it's January after all), ***Flight Risk*** seized the opportunity to top the box office. The weekend's other new release was Neon's ***Presence***, which had a soft start in less than 2,000 theaters. But the real loser was Angel Studios' ***Brave the Dark***, which flopped with one of the worst debuts in 2,000 theaters.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $54.2 million this weekend. That's up 30.1% from last year, when ***Mean Girls*** repeated on the top spot for a third week.\n\nDebuting in 3,161 theaters, Lionsgate's ***Flight Risk*** earned $11.5 million this weekend. That's star Mark Wahlberg's biggest debut since ***Uncharted*** ($44 million), and his biggest for a non-IP since ***Instant Family*** ($18 million). Although for director Mel Gibson, this is his lowest debut as director since ***Man Without a Face*** ($4 million) back in 1993.\n\nThis is an okay, not great start. The production kept the budget low at $25 million and it clearly shows, given the film is mostly set in a plane with only three characters. And perhaps that's why the film didn't make a huge landing here; it simply lacks an interesting hook. The plot gave streaming vibes and the film's tone (the tagline is \"Y'all need a pilot?\") suggested it this was going to be a non-event. It's simply a film that people saw a few times already.\n\nThere's also a problem regarding star power. Wahlberg is clearly well known, but his name has taken a dive in the past years. Most of his films in the past years have flopped, with ***Uncharted*** becoming the rare box office hit (and that's because of the IP). Michelle Dockery (who also starred in another plane thriller, ***Non-Stop***, back in 2014) and Topher Grace aren't big names that draw people to theaters either. And Lionsgate decided to avoid showcasing Gibson's involvement from marketing, choosing to use \"from the director of ***Braveheart***, ***Apocalypto*** and ***Hacksaw Ridge***\" as its selling point. While Gibson is often considered a great filmmaker, this was a miss: it's sitting at an awful 25% on RT.\n\nAccording to Lionsgate, 54% of the audience was male and 55% was 25 and over. Critics hated the film and audiences agreed; they gave it an awful \"C\" on CinemaScore, which is simply terrible for an action thriller. With other thriller/action films like ***Companion*** and ***Love Hurts*** coming up, this film is heading for a freefall. For now, a $25 million domestic total is likely, which will make it Gibson's least attended film as director.\n\n***Mufasa*** dipped 29%, adding $8.5 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $220.9 million, and it should get close to $250 million by the end of its run.\n\nSony's ***One of Them Days*** eased just 32%, adding $8 million this weekend. That's a very great hold for a comedy, indicating word of mouth is strong with this one. Through ten days, the film has earned $25.1 million domestically, and it should finish with over $40 million.\n\nIn fourth place, ***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** eased 38%, adding $5.3 million. That takes its domestic total to $225.9 million.\n\n***Moana 2*** eased just 30%, adding $4.1 million this weekend. The film has amassed $449.9 million so far.\n\nIn sixth place, Neon's ***Presence*** debuted with $3.3 million in 1,750 theaters. That's Steven Soderbergh's worst debut in wide release, below ***Unsane*** ($3.7 million). But this result is not surprising. At least it was above Neon's recent horror ***Cuckoo*** ($3 million).\n\nSoderbergh has pivoted from theatrical releases, with ***Magic Mike's Last Dance*** making his first theatrical film since 2018. In those years, he has gone on to release films for Netflix and Max instead. Neon chose to save costs and avoid releasing it too wide, feeling that Soderbergh's brand could carry it. But it looks like in a sea of horror/thrillers like ***Nosferatu***, ***Wolf Man*** and ***Companion***, this one simply got lost in the shuffle.\n\nAccording to Neon, 56% of the audience was male and 73% was 25 and over. They gave it a \"C+\" on CinemaScore, which isn't surprising, considering the marketing sells a different film. It's unlikely ***Presence*** can leg it out to $10 million lifetime.\n\nAfter its weak debut, Blumhouse's ***Wolf Man*** dropped to seventh place, earning $3.2 million. That's a very awful 70% drop from last weekend, far worse than ***The Invisible Woman*** (46.3%) and it's also slightly worse than 2010's ***The Wolfman*** (68.6%). Well, considering the film's tepid response and poor word of mouth, that's not really surprising. Through ten days, the film has earned just $17.6 million, and it will close with just $22 million at most.\n\nSearchlight's ***A Complete Unknown***, coming off its 8 Oscar nominations, had the best drop in the Top 10. It eased a light 18%, adding $3 million this weekend. With that, the film's domestic total now stands at $62.9 million.\n\nIn ninth place, ***Den of Thieves: Pantera*** fell a further 55% this weekend, adding $2.9 million. The film has earned $31.8 million, and will now officially close below $40 million domestically.\n\nRounding up the Top 10 was A24's ***The Brutalist***, coming off its 10 Oscar nominations. It finally hit wide release in 1,118 theaters, and the film earned $2.8 million this weekend. That's a fine start, especially considering its 215-minute runtime limited the amount of screenings. With this, the film's domestic lifetime stands at $9.3 million, and it's gonna continue legging out.\n\nAfter 10 weekends, ***Wicked*** has finally left the Top 10. But it still eased 34%, adding $2.3 million this weekend and taking its domestic total to $468.7 million.\n\nIt's not until the 12th spot where we find Angel Studios' ***Brave the Dark***, which flopped with $2.2 million in 2,230 theaters. That's one of the worst debuts for any film at over 2,000 theaters, and marks another loss for Angel Studios, which has been failling to find a success after ***Sound of Freedom***.\n\n***Nosferatu*** fell 52%, adding $1.9 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $93.1 million, and it looks like it might take some time in reaching $100 million.\n\n***September 5*** expanded to 395 theaters this weekend, earning just $745,064. The film has earned only $1.6 million, and with the lack of awards prospects, it's going to disappear quickly.\n\nAfter a very confusing platform release, Amazon MGM finally expanded ***Nickel Boys*** into 540 theaters, just as it received 2 Oscar noms. But the film earned just $348,060, which is very low. That took its domestic total to $1.5 million, and it needs some strong word of mouth to leg out.\n\nIFC Films released Neil Burger's new action thriller ***Inheritance*** in 627 theaters, and it flopped with an abysmal $124,817. That's the 13th worst debut for a film playing in over 600 theaters, and it also translates to a putrid $199 per-theater average. It will fade quickly.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Mufasa*** once again led the foreign box office. It added $15.4 million, taking its worldwide total to $627 million. The best markets are France ($38.1M), UK ($34.7M), Mexico ($28.3M), Germany ($27.8M) and Italy ($23.1M).\n\n***Sonic the Hedgehog 3*** added $10.6 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $446.3 million. The best markets are the UK ($28.9M), Mexico ($21.1M), France ($18.4M), Australia ($17.1M) and Brazil ($12.3M).\n\nAhead of its American debut in February, ***Paddington in Peru*** added $6.3 million this weekend, taking its overseas total to $83 million.\n\n***Moana 2*** added $5.8 million, taking its worldwide total to $1.026 billion. The best markets are France ($61.8M), UK ($51.2M), Germany ($44M), Australia ($31.8M) and Japan ($31.6M).\n\n***Nosferatu*** added $4.2 million, and its worldwide total is now $166.5 million. The best markets are the UK ($14.7M), Mexico ($7.8M), Germany ($5.3M), Spain ($5.1M) and Italy ($5.1M).\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Red One* | Nov/15 | Amazon MGM | $32,106,112 | $97,000,759 | $185,895,441 | $250M\n*Better Man* | Dec/25 | Paramount | $1,063,901 | $1,983,648 | $13,504,215 | $110M\n\n- The hierarchy of power in the Christmas Cinematic Universe didn't change at all. For ***Red One***, it closed with just $185 million, far below it's $250 million budget. Even if it was supposed to be on streaming, it's still underwhelming that the film couldn't hit $200 million worldwide or $100 million domestically. Is The Rock a draw? Certainly. Does that warrant a high budget? Look up here and ***Black Adam***. \n\n- Well, this shit is bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S. Paramount simply gave up with ***Better Man*** after just 2 weeks in wide release; it will continue playing in who knows how many theaters, but they decided to stop reporting box office numbers. And so the film couldn't hit $2 million domestically. There are a few foreign markets left, but it has zero chance of making a comeback. Very disappointing.\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nDreamWorks is returning to the big screen with ***Dog Man***, which is based on Dav Pilkey's children's graphic novel series, and is also a spin-off and story within a story of *Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie*. As the first family animated film (get out of the way, ***Mufasa***) since ***Moana 2***, this has so much on its favor and should easily top the box office.\n\nAnother release is WB's ***Companion***, which follows a a weekend getaway among friends at a remote cabin, which unravels into chaos after a revelation that one of the guests is a companion robot. The marketing has been very resistant in showing more of the plot, choosing instead to emphasize its connection to ***Barbarian*** (Zach Cregger is a producer here). With some great reviews so far (94% on RT), perhaps it could surprise.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

A Weir-Ford collaboration akin to Scorsese-De Niro would have been something. I don't know the behind the scenes of it all and maybe Weir and Ford tried to make other projects but they fell through.\n\nFord was also heavily recruited for the Michael Douglas role in Steven Soderbergh's Traffic. I just don't get turning down Soderbergh, you know? And Soderbergh likes to collaborate with his actors he has worked with before. A Soderbergh-Ford pairing over multiple movies would have been something to see.\n\nI just think Ford lessened his dramatic ambitions and retreated to mediocre thrillers and callbacks to earlier roles that sometimes worked (Blade Runner 2049) and sometimes didn't (Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.)",

        "content": "Mine is Into The Wild (2007).\n\nI was about the same age as the main character, Chris McCandless, when I watched the movie for the first time. Although there weren\u2019t many similarities between his life and mine, it had a profound impact on my thought process moving forward in life.\n\nI started looking at college, career, and friendships as options, and I didn\u2019t really give them the importance they deserved. I did it all, but not wholeheartedly\u2014not with purpose, the way other people did.\n\nJust like Chris, I started finding ways to be alone in any situation. No matter what the situation was, it was only being alone that brought me peace\u2014whether it was being alone in my room, getting on a random bus and traveling without any purpose, writing a journal while sitting in the garden, or going to the roof to look at the stars. It was almost as if, whenever I was around people, I felt lonelier.\n\nJust like Chris realized in the end that \u201chappiness is real only when shared,\u201d I\u2019ve realized in the last two years that friendships, love, and family are extremely important for a good life.\n\nYou cannot live an isolated life if you want to be successful\u2014unless you\u2019re a genius who is so good at what he does and so busy working that nothing else really bothers him. People skills are really important if you want to advance in your career. You need to be a good communicator to have a healthy relationship. You need to have connections with the right people when things get tough. Life has taught me these lessons the hard way.\n\nMy reluctance (unknowingly) to get along with people has resulted in many friendships ending or going stale. My fear of losing people and the belief that someone would take away my personal space kept me away from relationships. My preconceived notions of having zero expectations from others and thinking people are inherently bad stopped me from developing meaningful connections.\n\nI really wish I hadn\u2019t watched that movie at that age. I was just starting to open up to people. I was at a stage in my life where I was still figuring out how life works, and I couldn\u2019t get that movie out of my head for years.\n\nI\u2019m doing well now. I hang out with people. I spend time with my family whenever I can. I\u2019m still learning to make new friends and develop connections, but I\u2019ll get better.\n\nWhat is a movie you wish you hadn\u2019t watched, and why?\n\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "I enjoyed the theme of sacrifice and redemption and this was not a gangster movie that glamorizes mob life or focuses too much about being a criminal and killing. It's actually more about the protagonist, Rocky Sullivan (James Cagney), who's a notorious gangster just out of prison. His childhood best friend is Fr Jerry Connolly (Pat O'Brien) who's now a Priest and yearns to reform the juvenile delinquents in the neighborhood, played by (the very annoying) Dead End Kids. \n\nRocky comes into play because he starts associating himself with the boys in the neighborhood while still behaving like a big shot. When Rocky kills a few fellow gangsters who turned on him and he's caught and sentenced to die, Father Jerry asks Rocky for the ultimate sacrifice. \n\nThis was a genuinely good movie. Cagney is brilliant in this, tough and full of bravado but also a nice guy underneath the tough exterior. O'Brien noble and a voice of reaon. I also liked Ann Sheridan as a spunky romantic interest for Rocky.",

Likewise, I have a friend who prefers Major League 2 to the original (completely inexplicable to me). Obviously some sequels are as good of movies as the originals like Godfather 2, Toy Story 2 and 3, or Empire Strikes Back, but some sequels are obviously inferior to their originals, but you just like it better. My choice for this is Karate Kid 2. I love the Japanese setting and the higher stakes of the final fight, not to mention how unbelievably cool the ice breaking scene is. What's your choice for a movie who's sequel is definitely not as well made, acted, shot, but you still like it better?",

Tbh I don't think most musician's lives are interesting enough for a biopic and usually it just feels like an excuse to recreate a bunch of their performances. They also tend to only show the best parts of their lives and leave out a lot of the negative stuff. If I'm interested enough I'd rather watch a documentary on them. Its much more interesting.",

Basically, the opposite of greatest films ever made. But you enjoyed it and relish rewatching it.\n\nHere are mine:\n\n\n1. DOA: Dead or Alive (2006)\n\nOn its release it was dragged by 'serious' cinema people as schlock, the gamer fans disparaged Devon Aoki as not looking like Kasumi at all and yet the wire work and fight choreography was a lot of fun to watch, personally. Holly Valance brought charisma to her role as Christie, and Jaime Pressly was charming in an all-american way. The pre-covid aughts era involved a lot of mindless fun, and it is sorely missed today.\n\n2. Blood: The Last Vampire (2009)\n\nCriticised for not having the finesse of the anime, but still a serviceable action flick if rather silly.\n\n3. American Satan (2017)\n\nAndy Black and his rock troupe get supernatural assistance and the film needs refinement. But the costumes are stylish and the amateurish production adds to its appeal.\n\n4. Confessions of a Shopaholic (2009)\n\nSaccharine in all the right ways - mocked by critics on release for being a fluffy chick flick, but delves into materialist obsession. Isla is suitably comedic.\n\n5. The Wrong Missy (2020)\n\nDavid Spade plays a likeable dork who needs to shake an annoying weird girl and it's indeed formulaic, but it's appropriate as a romcom.\n\n6. Saltburn (2023)\n\nMany said it had nothing to say about class in the very end, but the dancepop song at the end uplifts like cinematic molly.\n\n7. Bangkok Dangerous (2008)\n\nNic cage tears it up in Thailand. Seedy, atmospheric and probably a deep cut in his filmography. All you really need is a guy and a gun.",

It would be beyond awesome if somebody got Villeneuve to direct it.\n\nBut Crichton was the master of writing the line where science stops and fiction begins. Next, Micro, State of Fear - in the hands of the right screenwriter &amp; director, any of those would be a badass film. Hell, even Pirate Latitudes would be a killer popcorn flick.\n\nPretty sure I read a studio has already optioned Eruption. Fingers crossed we don't get another Timeline.",

'SUPERMAN' Still goes so hard emotionally for the character.\n\nAnd then lastly before I open it up to other choices, is the scene towards the end of Wreck It Ralph, where the title character is falling out of the sky and has his epiphany that he was born to play his part, and he owns it in that moment. \"I'm bad, and that's good. I will never be good, and thats not bad. There's nobody I would rather be, than me\"\n\nAll of these scenes have huge stakes and emotional weight and I'm sure there are others out there!

        "content": "Denzel really owned this role, and made every film so enjoyable to watch, but these films absolutely delivered on the simple premise of a badass, retired ex D.I.A Vigilante delivering justice to the bad guys and being the guardian angel of death to the hopeless that need him. Im gonna do my best to avoid spoilers.\n\n  \nEqualizer 1- My personal favorite out of the trilogy. The mystique of robert Mcall was at it's highest due to how little we knew about him, and we see the duality of his character by how he could be such a wise, supportive, kind hearted person that pushes others around him to be the best they can be, but also an absolute, cold, calculating, menacing killer to the ones that deserve it. Great acting, despicable villians, feel good vigilante justice, and a good ending.\n\n  \nEqualizer 2- The theme of this is revenge, and this is really personal for Robert Mcall. Good classic vigilante justice, with also Robert being a great father figure to a young man that needed guidance. When that very tragic thing happens to robert, you want the bad guys to get the worst that could come to them, and boy oh boy does Robert do what robert does best. Honestly probably even more satisfying than the first on the justice side of things, but i prefer the overall story of the first.\n\n  \nEqualizer 3- I have mixed feelings on this one. It has the least action, and slowest pace out of the 3, but DAMN this has got to be my favorite portrayal of robert mcall out of all 3. Robert in equalizer 3 is basically a brutal, horror movie slasher with good morals that is genuinely terrifying and at his most violent by far. Even gave me Michael myers vibes in some scenes with ominous soundtrack.  However the italian mob in this is so evil, i enjoyed every scene when Robert gave them what was coming to them. It has a beautiful setting, awesome soundtrack, despite the lack of action when the action does happen it's a A+ and a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy.\n\n  \nOverall the equalizer series is my second favorite action series of all time (only behind the john wick series) and i really enjoyed my time with them, and consider them classic action films.\n\n  \nDenzel already revealed he is working on a equalizer 4 and 5, and although i feel Equalizer 3 ended the series perfectly, as long as Robert is portrayed the way he is in equalizer 3, i am looking forward to them.\n\n  \nWhat are your thoughts on the equalizer series?",

The final scene is the final survivors as they drive off in the Army truck into the sunset. I always felt that the sunlight was a metaphor for all of the soldiers who died in the movie, the sunlight represents them being at peace as the movie comes to a closure.\n\nI also loved how they credited every character with a photo at the end along with the name of the actor. I always felt sad seeing the Americans that died in the movie seeing their faces one last time, again, to that beautiful music and outro song.\n\nI actually am starting to tear up right now posting this so I suppose I'll leave it at that. Thanks so much for reading.\n\nRIP dad, I would give anything to watch these movies with you again as an adult. ",
