I am fully convinced that the events in this movie, even though it is a satire, would 100% play out the same way in real life, to a point that it converted me to being a misanthrope.\n\nDid others enjoy this movie as well? Did you enjoy the movie or didn't think much of it?",

He\u2019s living with family members when an assistant coach says he could stay with him in his fancy house because it will be easier for him to go to school.\n\nWell, The Blind Side is on TV and it\u2019s insane. They portray Michael as a homeless, scared simpleton who gets taken in by the rich family before he even joins the football team.\n\nThis has to be be one of the biggest difference between a true story and what\u2019s on film I\u2019ve seen (or at least know about).\n\n",

I l liked the intimate drama of it, even though some of the close up face shots were unsettling.  \n\nAs much as I liked it, I was really distracted by the fact that Henry Fonda looks like a blend of comic book Norman Osborn and Willem Dafoe.  \n\n---\nEdit 1 - We just finished 2001. It was definitely an experience, especially the last chapter. I think I'll want to revisit it again. At the suggestion of another user I looked up the Wikipedia article, which references Clark's original book which gives a rather straightforward answer for the monolith that locates the concern of the last act, in part, in concerns about the evolution of the human race.\n\nWith that said, I couldn't help but bring with me the semi-gnostic metaphysics of Xenogears and Xenosaga, especially to the last act.",

Brando is an information broker. He's not really part of the actual heist. \n\nBassett is just there to be DeNiro's love interest. She's barely in the movie and knows next to nothing about the actual heist. \n\nAnd secondly, there's a twist in the movie that they straight up spoil in the trailer. \n\nAn absolutely horrible trailer for an otherwise good movie.",

Contrast, depth of field, interesting composition... \n\nI think what's happened recently is that big budget movies are being directed by people with almost zero experience and every single creative decision is being left for post production. That's why movies are \"flat\" right now. \n\nAt least a few years back our daft, big budget nonsense was made by people who had some visual flair. ",

However, now that I'm trying to think of some, nothing is coming to mind.\n\nBelieve it or not, what got me thinking about this was The Joker 2. I realized that if you break down what Arthur actually did, it's a pretty short story.",

I know there's plenty that go darker and end brighter, but that one hits the mark basically flawlessly.",
