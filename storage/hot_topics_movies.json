For example:\n\n- For the longest time I avoided **Tropic Thunder** because it came out around the same time as Pineapple Express and from trailers and initial friends' reactions I feared it was going to have too much of the same kind of dumb comedy, something I normally really dislike. And it's funny because in certain ways that still turned out to be true, but TT just does everytthing - even the dumb stuff - just right!\n\n- I knew it was considered a classic but I wasn't that interested in seeing **Thelma &amp; Louise** honestly for no good reason other than I just didn't think it was going to stand the test of time that well. But, yea, I was very wrong, this is a great movie.\n\n- I normally don't like a lot of 80s horror so I hadn't seen **The Thing** for quite some time. But this is a classic for a very good reason.\n\nWhat are some for you? I'm curious about movies that you really didn't think you'd like, and why, only to be proved wrong.",

It's that ole 'on opposing sides but still respectful' notion. And with just one sentence, you get a whole sense of their relationship and history.\n\nWhat small moments in other films have stuck with you?\n\n(Also, still tickles me every time I watch it that two Brits are playing Americans, while the American plays a Russian).",

        "content": "It might be nostalgia affecting my view. Either way, I always had a soft spot for Willie Scott, because she was a fish out of water and acted accordingly. \n\nCritics sometimes complain about the Mary Sue or the leading lady who turns into GI Jane in just 15 minutes, yet with Willie Scott, the spoiled Cabaret singer who's taken \"hostage\" by Indiana Jones and finds herself falling off planes and made as a sacrifice for a Satanic God, she never changes. She screams, she has temper tantrums, she cries and she is grossed out by the food. \n\nI liked her for it, because it's how most humans would have acted in her place, and I enjoyed Kate Capshaw's attempts at bringing screwball humor as well as showing Willie having a bit of a evolution along the way. \n\nShe's not the smart and adventurous Marion Ravenwood, she's not expected to be. Every romantic interest Indiana Jones had in the original trilogy was different. Willie was, easily, the one leading lady who had the meatiest role since she's onscreen for most of the film. \n\nCan I also say the \"Anything Goes\" number in Cantonese opening number slays the house boots down? You could tell Steven Spielberg could direct a musical if he wanted in 1984.",

        "content": "I think it's fair to say Sunshine is a visually gorgeous film and the soundtrack is beautiful as well. The story itself can be interpreted in multiple ways which makes it more interesting.\n\nThe writer of the film, Alex Garland said he \"wrote Sunshine as a film about *atheism*.\"\n\nHe expanded on the subject on the introduction of the *Sunshine* *screenplay*.\n\n\"A crew is en route to a God-like entity: the Sun. The Sun is larger and more powerful than we can imagine. The Sun gave us life, and can take it away.\n\n\"As the crew travel nearer to the Sun, the majesty of the burning star fries their minds. The crew are hypnotized by it, or baffled by it, or driven mad by it. Ultimately, even the most rational crew member is overwhelmed by his sense of wonder and, as he falls into the star, he believes he is touching the face of *God*.\n\n\"The Sun is *God-like*, but not *God*. Not a conscious being. Not a divine architect. And the crew member is only doing what man has always done: making an awestruck category error when confronted with our small place within the vast and neutral scheme of things.\"\n\nThe director, Danny Boyle, had a different approach.\n\n\"The director, Danny Boyle, who is not atheistic in the way that I am, felt differently. He believed that the crew actually were meeting *God*.\n\n\" I didn't see this as a major problem, because the difference in our approach wasn't in conflict with the way in which the story would be told. The two interpretation that could be made from the narrative were the same two interpretations that could be made from the world around us.\"\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this subject?",
