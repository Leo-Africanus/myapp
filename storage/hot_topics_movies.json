        "title": "Oliver Platt",
        "content": "Oliver Platt turns 66 today and I gotta say I've become a fan. He's not a particularly well-known or even highly acclaimed actor but he's always been the standout in everything he's been in. His screen presence is literally (he's 6 foot 3 and a large guy) and figuratively immense.\n\nI saw him for the first time in the movie 2012; that movie had John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Chiwetel Eijofor and Danny Glover but for some reason, he's literally the only actor I remember from that movie after 17 years; I looked up the wiki on it recently and was shocked at how many A listers were involved but it was only him that stood out to me. His role in X Men First Class was much much smaller and barely relevant to the plot, but over a decade since I last watched the movie I still remember him being in it, clear as day.\n\nHe also got me watching The Big C and I found it one of the best acted US series I've ever watched; maybe it's because it also starred Laura Linney and a host of other great actors and he was a pretty good foil to Laura's character. Most US series I've watched tend to have very dry acting but in this case it was like being in the room with a bunch of real life people and he was a huge part of that. Also I never watched a medical series before as I found them too boring and heavy but he got me watching clip after clip of Chicago Med too; I don't think I would have watched if not for him and if his character leaves I would likely drop it immediately since there is no other character so far I have connected with.\n\nI have only seen a fraction of his body of work over 3 decades but it seems a lot of people feel the same way about him no matter which of his work they watch. Particularly in The Three Musketeers they always quote his character and this was a film that also starred Charlie Sheen and Kiefer Sutherland who are way bigger household names than he is.\n\nHe's impressed me whatever his character's moral alignment is but a part of me kind of wishes he would play more snooty high society types; apparently he comes from a very old money background  so I don't think there's anyone more suited to play a rich snob than him lol.\n\nWhat are your thoughts about Oliver Platt?",

        "content": "Just rewatched Heat and man, Michael Mann pulled off something insane. Neil McCauley and Vincent Hanna are literal mirror images ,both hyper professional, both lonely as hell, both living by impossible codes. By the coffee shop scene you're like \"wait, I want Neil to escape with Eady , but I ALSO want Vincent to finally catch the one guy who matches him.\" \n\nIt's strangely uncomfortable and thrilling , like the film is forcing you to hold two opposing desires in your head simultaneously. The tragic ending lands so hard precisely because you've been emotionally invested in both men. There's no clean victory; whoever \"wins,\" something valuable is lost.\n\n",

        "title": "High Fidelity Discussion",
        "content": "I just finished High Fidelity with John Cusack, and I had a couple thoughts lingering in my head that I\u2019d like to get some perspective on.\n\n1) Why is the fact that Rob cheated on Laura totally glossed over? He mentions it in passing and doesn\u2019t go into detail, which I interpreted as a sign of his lack of self awareness and identity as a chronic victim. However no other character really goes into this. That was a totally valid reason for Laura to leave him, and I don\u2019t really understand why she\u2019d even consider taking him back. Maybe thats me being naive to the reality of that situation, but I thought it was kind of odd that this was never addresses or explored, it seemed like a set up for a central conflict but in the end it doesn\u2019t matter at all? I thought this would for sure be explored after he sleeps with Maria after finding out Laura had sex with Ian, but I guess that scene was just to show his hypocrisy and lack of emotional maturity. I\u2019m curious to know someone else\u2019s thoughts on this, and if it says something about Rob or his relationship with Laura that I might\u2019ve missed.\n\n2) Much more of a smaller question, but during the dinner scene with Charlie there is a cut to Rob standing outside her door talking to himself about the conversation he\u2019s about to have with Charlie. Is this scene meant to take place before he goes inside the house? Was the point of it to show that he never had any intention other than figuring out why she left him? It almost seemed like it was implying the conversation never even happened, but I don\u2019t think thats it.\n\nAnyway, would love to hear some opinions on this or the movie as a whole. I found it pretty enjoyable despite the main character being an emotionally stunted man child.\n",
