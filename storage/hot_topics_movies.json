        "title": "'Avatar: Fire and Ash' - Review Thread",
        "content": "*The conflict on Pandora escalates as Jake and Neytiri's family encounter a new, aggressive Na'vi tribe.*\n\nDirector: James Cameron\n\nCast: Zoe Saldana, Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Kate Winslet, Michelle Yeoh, Oona Chaplin, David Thewlis, Jack Champion\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [66%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/avatar_fire_and_ash)\n\n**Metacritic:** [61 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/avatar-fire-and-ash/)\n\nSome Reviews (updating):\n\n[nssmagazine - Martina Barone](https://www.nssmag.com/en/lifestyle/43723/avatar-3-fire-and-ash-review)\n\n&gt;The repetitiveness to which Avatar - Fire and Ash subjects us cannot be condoned, especially when it chooses to keep spectators seated in front of the big screen for three hours and twenty minutes. The only novelty that adds real surprise in Avatar 3 is the lethal leader Varang, played by Oona Chaplin. Head of the Ash People, the warrior is ravenous, brutal, and fiercely unforgiving. With *Avatar 4* scheduled for 2029 and *Avatar 5* for 2031, not only does the third title re-propose visual and entertainment solutions already tested and therefore not unprecedented, but one wonders **what else there would be to say** given the **emotional and spectacular weight** of *Avatar - Fire and Ash*. What else is there to tell that hasn't been told yet, especially considering the film seems like a repetition? What is there to see that hasn't been shown yet?\n\n[Variety - Owen Glieberman](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/avatar-fire-and-ash-review-james-cameron-1236605109/)\n\n&gt;The Story Is Fine, the Action Awesome, as the Third \u2018Avatar\u2019 Film Does New Variations on a No-Longer-New Vision. It's better then the second film \u2014\u00a0bolder and tighter \u2014 and still has its share of amazements. But it no longer feels visually unprecedented.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - David Rooney](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/avatar-fire-and-ash-review-james-cameron-sam-worthington-1236450205/)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s easily the most repetitious entry in the big-screen series, with a been-there, bought-the-T-shirt fatigue that\u2019s hard to ignore.\"\n\n[NextBestPicture - Dan Bayer](https://nextbestpicture.com/avatar-fire-and-ash/) \\- 8 / 10\n\n&gt;Another visually-stunning spectacle with a rock-solid story that makes the most of its epic length and big budget to deepen its universe. The cast rises to the occasion, especially Oona Chaplin as the villainous Varang.\u00a0While it still works, the plot echoes both prior films in the series so closely that it borders on self-plagiarization.\n\n[Slant Magazine - Keith Uhlich](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/avatar-fire-and-ash-review-james-cameron/) \\- 2 / 5\n\n&gt;Cameron has never been especially good at writing characters beyond the broadest of strokes, which isn\u2019t much of a detriment when, as in *Aliens* and the two *Terminator* films, the narrative stakes are high and the technological innovations augment rather than overwhelm the comic-book fervor of his vision. The *Avatar* movies, by contrast, are empty vessels of pro-forma spectacle that, true to the very disposable era of entertainment in which we\u2019re living, make bank primarily because of how quickly they can be memory-holed.\n\n[Consequence - Liz Shannon Miller](https://consequence.net/2025/12/avatar-fire-and-ash-review-james-cameron/) \\- 'B'\n\n&gt;Yes, the execution defies subtlety, but subtlety has never been a defining aspect of this franchise. Everything is always loud, from the music to the visual design to the emotions. It\u2019s an approach ensuring that Cameron\u2019s message will be heard by even the most distracted viewer. Cameron has ended the world twice over with *The Terminator* movies, depicted the true-life tragedy of the Titanic, and explored the terrors of marriage and motherhood with *True Lies* and *Aliens*. Yet by comparison, *Fire and Ash* finds him unafraid to dig around in the darkest corners of the human soul. That Cameron wants to push into heavier themes at this point in his career speaks well of his ambition as a storyteller, and generates some real excitement for what might come next. Though, considering the budget of these movies\u2026 therapy might be cheaper.\n\n[The Wrap - William Bibbiani](https://www.thewrap.com/avatar-fire-and-ash-review-james-cameron/)\n\n&gt;The only way \u2018Avatar: Fire and Ash\u2019 could be more hypocritical, and taken less seriously, is if the characters also yelled \u201cHypocrisy sucks!\u201d while sitting on Whoopee cushions.\n\n[Los Angeles Times - Amy Nicholson](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2025-12-16/avatar-fire-ash-review-sam-worthington-zoe-saldana-sigourney-weaver-stephen-lang-james-cameron)\n\n&gt;'Avatar: Fire and Ash\u2019 has dynamite villains and dialogue that\u2019s surf-bro hysterical. But plot-wise, the story is the same as ever. So instead of getting swept away by the narrative, I just settled in to enjoy the details: hammerhead sharks twisted into pickaxes, ships that scuttle like crabs, the drama of an underwater scream",

        "title": "Scorsese\u2019s awareness that De Niro is not really Italian is charming",
        "content": "Robert De Niro is, of course, a legendary American actor who\u2019s played a large variety of roles across many decades in the film business.\n\nWhile De Niro has played everything from a Spanish missionary to a WASPy CIA agent, he is often associated with Italian-American characters in movies like The Godfather Part II, The Untouchables, and the Analyze This series. There is a popular image of him as one of the prototypical Italian gangster types of U.S. cinema.\n\nDe Niro has a recognizably Italian name, which adds to this perception. But he is only a quarter Italian-American. Most of his family comes from Northern European countries including Ireland, England, Germany, and the Netherlands.\n\nDe Niro\u2019s famous collaborator Martin Scorsese seems keenly aware of this and has made a point of casting De Niro in roles where his lack of full Italian heritage is built into the plot. In each of Goodfellas, Casino, and The Irishman, De Niro\u2019s character is a notably non-Italian person navigating the Italian mafia environment while surrounded by Italian-Americans who don\u2019t recognize him as one of their own.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m exaggerating this a little bit? Scorsese did cast De Niro as Italians in his early film Mean Streets (alongside fellow non-Italian Harvey Keitel) and in biopic Raging Bull, playing the boxer Jake LaMotta.\n\nBut I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s something I just enjoy about the idea that the someone as extremely knowledgeable about human culture and Italian culture in particular as Scorsese - fully Sicilian, once married to Roberto Rossellini\u2018s daughter, director of a film called Italianamerican - looks at De Niro, commonly stereotyped as a quintessential Italian, and recognizes that he is not that.\n\nScorsese has also cast De Niro in various Anglo, Irish and ethnically miscellaneous roles over the decades. Meanwhile he has never cast Joe Pesci in a role that is not specifically Italian-American.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio, who like De Niro is only a quarter Italian-American but with a recognizably Italian name, has never played an Italian character in a Scorsese movie.",

        "content": "Every year, I hear the same debate; is Die Hard a Christmas movie? But what I don't hear is the debate about whether The Thing is a Christmas movie. \n\n\nThe evidence:\n\n\n*Takes place in the snow\n\n\n*most of the scenes take place at night, and the thing usually comes out at night just like santa on christmas\n\n\n*There's the same amount of characters as there is days of Christmas; 12\n\n\n*The plot of the film involves a bearded man figuring out who is naughty and who is nice\n\n\n*Kurt Russell's character is one of the only survivors. But he is stuck in the snow. This could possibly be a prequel to the film he plays Santa; The Christmas Chronicles(2018)\n\n\n*A lot of red glowing light in the film akin to Rudolph's red nose\n\n\n*Was filmed in December\n\n\n*late actor Donald Moffat was born on December 26th, one day after Christmas\n\n\n*MacReady's drink of choice is J&amp;B whisky. J&amp;B stand for Jingle Bells. It's also a green bottle with red font; two of the primary colors associated with Christmas.\n\n*Movie ends with the true meaning of Christmas; putting aside your differences and peace on Earth(since the thing has been stopped)\n\n\n*Thing is an anagram for Night. as in Silent Night. As it tries to take people out quietly. \n\n\n\nSo now you've heard the evidence... is it a Christmas movie or not?",

        "content": "I re-watched The Arrival (2016), and it\u2019s probably the most meaningful movie I\u2019ve ever watched. Now in my late 30s, it sounds cliche, but it hits with a different weight compared to when I first watched it 10 years ago.\n\n*Arrival* is one of the rare science-fiction films that treats intelligence, empathy, and restraint as its true spectacles. Beneath its fucking amazing and moody visuals and measured pacing lies a meditation on language as a technology, one capable of reshaping not just communication but cognition itself. Villeneuve avoids the genre\u2019s usual obsession with conquest or catastrophe, grounding the encounter instead in linguistics, uncertainty, love, and grief.\n\nThat idea mirrors real life as you age. By this point, you\u2019ve learned that understanding does not come without cost. The film\u2019s most unsettling truth is not that the visitors are unknowable, but that truly understanding them permanently alters how time, choice, and loss are experienced. At this point in life, you recognise these patterns in your own life, relationships, careers, and love. You see how earlier decisions quietly encoded both joy and pain, and how awareness doesn\u2019t free you from consequence, it deepens it.\n\nIn that sense, *Arrival* is less about extraterrestrials than about maturity. It asks whether knowledge, love, and connection are still worth pursuing when you can already foresee their endings. The film\u2019s answer feels profoundly adult: meaning isn\u2019t found in avoiding loss, but in choosing fully, consciously, even when the outcome is known.",

As we went through the third act of that film I thought the lesson was going to be that some relationships work better as friendships than romantic partnerships, and that Nicholson, Hunt, and Kinnear were going to form an oddball friend group after Nicholson realized it's just not meant to be. I was FLOORED when he tried one more time at the end and it worked.\n\nAnyways, other examples?",

        "content": "I\u2019m looking for romance movie recommendations and wanted to hear other people\u2019s opinions. I really love The Notebook and the kind of romance it shows \u2014 emotional, passionate, and unforgettable. I like movies that make you feel deeply connected to the characters and their relationship, whether the story is happy, sad, or bittersweet. What I enjoy most is strong chemistry, meaningful moments, and a love story that actually sticks with you after the movie ends.\n\nI\u2019m mostly interested in more modern romance movies rather than very old or classic films. I don\u2019t mind if the movie is dramatic or even a little heartbreaking, as long as the romance feels genuine and well written. Movies where the relationship feels real, intense, or complicated usually stand out to me more than light or overly cheesy romances.\n\nI\u2019m open to different styles of romance \u2014 slow burns, emotional love stories, realistic relationships, or even romances mixed with other genres like drama or thriller \u2014 but the love story should still be a big part of the movie. I also appreciate good acting and dialogue that makes the emotions feel believable.\n\nIn your opinion, what is the best romantic movie of all time that isn\u2019t too old? If you also like The Notebook, what other movies gave you a similar emotional experience? I\u2019d love to know your recommendations and why those movies stood out to you.",
