Awkward guy does all he can to win over girl and even helps her out more than anyone when she had no one else to turn to. Girl kisses awkward guy and they are sorta becoming a thing. Girl gets back with awkward guys attractive friend instead in the end. \n\nA guilty pleasure of mine. \n\nFun fact, the cast had to wear their own clothing and do their own hair and makeup etc. because the film had a low budget that couldn\u2019t pay to keep those people around. The cast of teens is also played by actual teenagers for a change (for the most part). The film was going to have a sequel that follows Gary to college but it was canceled after this one flopped in theaters, however it made millions of dollars after being released to home video and gained a cult following.

        "content": "I was told by many online and in-person that this film would break me, especially if you related to the story being told. Two years ago around this time, I experienced the most painful breakup I had ever felt in my life. Me and my ex had permanently split lives right after a partial breakup, and it completely destroyed me. A woman who I thought would birth my first child and share many more memories with me suddenly became a stranger and at the time an enemy to me. In the moment, none of our heart felt moments felt like anything. I legitimately remember crying begging God or somebody above to erase any thought I had of her, because for that time then and to this day I have thoughts of her that used to send chills up my spine and give me goosebumps. My heart would drop thinking of the fact she was moving on completely care-free while I was stutter stepping around my life while also having her in the back of my brain at most times. It genuinely upset me how much time and effort I thought about her and how or what I could have done differently to make our lives work together. We were very different people with very different upbringings, but when we made it work it was beautiful. I have never fully forgiven myself for letting her slip away and I think I will forever hold some space for her. After watching this film, it has completely shifted my perspective on the memories we share. I think a very important lesson in this movie to save is that relationships will be extremely ugly, and extremely breath-taking. As humans I feel we like to cling on to negativity, no matter what the ratio is. One awful moment can completely erase 1000 thoughtful acts, and that\u2019s completely fair. There\u2019s no measuring disrespect or hurt, if something hurts you to the point of leaving even after reconsidering, leave. And so what I will take with me from this film is pushing through the ugly is worth it, what\u2019s worth having will take forgiveness, not all great things have great endings, memories are worth keeping even the bad ones, and that we can love the right person at the wrong time. I genuinely wanna thank Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet for their amazing performances, if I could give them both a handshake right now I would, but the best I can do is a little more than lengthy reddit post off of a couple drinks. Amazing film that I rented on youtube (i have never rented a film on youtube before), cannot recommend anymore and would love to converse over the film or any topics it touched on\ud83d\udc95 much love ",

        "content": "I have a personal theory, based solely on acendotal observations, that the opening of Raiders of the Lost Ark is the most parodied movie scene of all time. Specifically the part where Indy swaps the golden idol for the bag of sand and then escapes from the boulder. \n\nThe scene is perfect to parody because it's visually memorable (obviously), easy to replicate in other situations and characters, and doesn't involve any dialogue. Even kid shows can parody it since there's nothing too adult about the scene.\n\nNow, I have no way of proving this without watching and cataloging hundreds of hours of film and tv (not to mention comics, video games, etc). That being said, does anyone else agree? \n\nIf not, what scene do you think has been parodied more? Or what scenes are runners up for the title?\n",

Not only because of Julie Andrews, but also because of the costumes, the humor, the song-and-dance sequences, orphan characters, eccentric rich people, the lavish sets and a villain that wasn\u2019t really relevant to the story. Come to think of it, it might have been similar to The Happiest Millionare.",

        "content": "I saw The Bad News Bears when I was a kid, but I rewatched it tonight at 31 and honestly, I loved it even more this time around.\n\nIt\u2019s loaded with language you\u2019d never get away with today, racial slurs, sexual slurs, and a total lack of political correctness but in a weird way, that\u2019s what makes it feel like such an authentic slice of life from the 70s. It was unapologetic, rough around the edges, and kind of refreshing compared to how careful movies and life are now.\n\nOf course, some parts are over the top like the abusive dad and coaches but it all fits into that era\u2019s gritty honesty. And I couldn\u2019t help but laugh at Buttermaker coaching a team of total misfits with a cigar in his mouth and a beer in hand the entire time. Nobody cared, nobody blinked, and somehow it worked.\n\nIt really made me wish I could\u2019ve been part of that generation when people weren\u2019t walking on eggshells about every little thing. All in all, the movie still holds up, and maybe even hits harder as an adult.",
