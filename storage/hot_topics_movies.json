        "content": "I often heard the opinion that the last scene of the movie is a subtle hint of how Joel and Clem get into another cycle of erasing themselves. And while I understand the logic of why people read it like this, I still feel that something is off with that interpretation.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t know, in the [original](https://collider.com/eternal-sunshine-of-the-spotless-mind-original-ending/#:~:text=Eternal%20Sunshine%20of%20the%20Spotless%20Mind%27s%20original%20script%20had%20a,from%20a%20more%20cynical%20perspective) script the ending is a scene 50+ years after where Clem erases Joel for the 15th time while Joel leaves her audio messages asking why she's ignoring him, and Mary is assisting Clem.\n\nIt\u2019s just that initially in the director\u2019s mind, the movie was supposed to be a little more realistic and gritty. If we look at a few deleted scenes, we learn and see more of Naomi\u2019s character, previous Joel\u2019s girlfriend whom he mentions at the beginning of the movie. I think they\u2019ve cut the crucial [scene](https://youtu.be/ovxHfv8CR0s?si=e_yjpfzwmLCo1peq) of Joel and Naomi\u2019s breakup, where Naomi highlights to Joel that\u00a0\"the thing is, whatever you think it is you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off - you're still Joel with the same problems\". I think this scene is crucial to understanding the difference between Joel's character before and after the erasure process.\n\nWhen we see Lacuna Inc. for the first time, it seems like a fully legitimate business that's been functioning successfully for some time already, and there's not much to go wrong with the procedure. But the thing is, they are failing big time with Joel, Clem, and Mary, all at the same time.\n\nWith Clem, it goes wrong when creepy Patrick tries to stage \"love\" by using the things Joel was doing and saying before the erasure, and it seemingly rubs Clem off. With Joel, it goes wrong when he literally tries to stop the erasure process and tries to hide Clem in his deepest traumatic memories, and they erase Clem with the memories that weren't supposed to be erased at all.\n\nAnd especially wrong it goes with Mary, who at first is the most enthusiastic of all about erasing memories. Suddenly she gets the real disgusting taste of it when she learns that she erased memories of her previous affair with Dr. Mierzwiak. And even more, in the [alternative](https://youtu.be/rb5R2MsQkxI?si=GQ6DzF-zYQpe4wPw) deleted scene Mary was supposed to learn that Mierzwiak got her pregnant and also convinced her to have an abortion before erasing her memory. Imagine what a shock this is for a character, to learn that you had an abortion, and don't even remember that.\n\nBut still, it's Joel at the center of the story, the main accent of the story is on Joel, how he behaves, and how he interprets things.\n\nPeople love to point out that after the erasure process, Joel goes to Montauk again, and repeats the same steps... But he is not. This is a different Joel after the erasure.\n\nIf you really compare Joel before and after the erasure, you'll notice the real difference. Let's break it chronologically:\n\n\\- Joel meets Clem in Montauk, and they spend some time together. But then when Clem suggests spending more time together and going crazy, Joel freaks out and runs off. He later regrets running off, as he explains it while he's in his mind.\n\n&gt;I don't know. I felt like a scared little kid. I was like... It was above my head. I don't know. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation, I think. You said \"So go\" with such disdain, you know?\n\nIt's the very first case when Joel's insecurity cause issues and friction in his relationship with Clem.\n\n\\- Joel approaches Clem in the library trying to ask her out to go somewhere. Clem gives him her famous \"I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours\". In his mind, Joel confesses that even after that speech he still thought that Clem would save his life.\n\n\\- Then Joel breaks up with Naomi to be together with Clem.\n\n\\- We don't know if Joel had any other relationships before Naomi, but Naomi's phrase about Joel dragging his problems in every relationship assumes that if there were other relationships, Joel kind of was already in his own loop of constantly ruining relationships with his insecurities.\n\n\\- Joel and Clem get together, and as Naomi predicts, after the thrill wears off, Joel ruins it with his own jealousy and insecurities. It makes Clem go and erase him.\n\n\\- In an impulsive act, Joel goes to erase Clem too, but then he sabotages it, and he erases core child trauma memories that were causing his insecurities when he was with Clem.\n\n\\- After the erasure, by some miracle, Joel goes to Montauk and has his \"second\" first meeting with Clem there. But while Joel is depressed by having blank 2 years of his life (erased), you can notice that he's not that insecure anymore. After the conversation with Clem on the train, it's Joel who offers her a ride. It's wild to compare this Joel to the one who ran off from Clem in the beginning, you know? This New Joel even spends some time at Clem's home, and then when he comes home, he's waiting for a phone call from Clem with excitement.\n\n\\- Literally second meeting/date with Clem, they go to lie on the ice lake. While Joel is a bit unsure about this idea, he doesn't run off, and he goes along with it. He's *enthusiastic* about it. Again, compare it to the insecure Joel who literally left Clem alone in that house in Montauk.\n\n\\-After that in the morning Joel has enough self-security admitting \"I had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life\".\n\n\\-Joel loses it for a bit after the truth comes out, but to be honest, who wouldn't lose it like that in such a situation?\n\nAnd the final scene in the apartment. New Joel listens to all those wild things his older version is saying, and he wants to fall through the ground out of shame. He's so uncomfortable while listening to it. When he says \"I wouldn't think that about you\", it's not just *words*. Now he's literally secure enough not to think such wild and evil things in his head.\n\nIt's the scene where you can see this huge gap, this huge difference between the Old Joel and the New Joel. The last words we hear from the tape while Clem is going out is \"I thought I knew her so well. But I don't know her at all. What a loss to spend that much time, only to find out that she's a stranger.\"\n\nIt's the old Joel who spent so much time with her but didn't really know her in the end. And the new Joel isn't like that at all.\n\nThe final scene in the corridor mirrors the library scene they had before, and it's crucial to understand the difference here. Clem repeats her famous \"I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind\". And while Old Joel was still hoping that Clem would \"save\" him even after that speech, the New Joel was just literally exposed to the nastiest shit they had in their relationship. At this point, there's no illusion about \"saving\" anyone. New Joel says \"Okay\" as now he's secure enough to face all the imperfections he'll see down the road.\n\nAnd getting back to Mary for a bit, think about the contrast. In the original script, she was still working in Laguna Inc many years later. In the movie, she's already been in the cycle of repeating her affair with Dr. Mierzwiak for an indefinite amount of time. But this final time, she learns the truth, and whether it's just an affair, or abortion in the more gritty version of the movie, she decides to break the cycle. She sends everyone's tapes back to them, and the damage it will cause to the company is hard to define. Whether it's just an affair or an abortion, at this point Mary doesn't want to have any business with Mierzwiak or the whole erasure procedure again. She burns the bridges.\n\nAnd overall it raises an interesting conflict of ideas. While the original script is trying to prove that people don't change, and Clem and Joel would go into a repeating cycle, the movie tries to prove the opposite. The movie tries to prove that while people are messy and imperfect, there's still a chance for a brighter future as long as people are open enough to face the harsh truth.",
