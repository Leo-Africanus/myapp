The leader of the turtles is a human sized rat who has come into contact with the same green ooze. The rat was a former pet of a ninja master and therefore uses his skills to train the four turtles in martial arts.

To get the drug cartels to start fighting so they can destabilize the human trafficking network. Sorry but how does that even make sense? Shouldn't they go after the terrorist organizations that planned these attacks?\n\nAnd why and how did Alejandro even track down the kid who shot him? He was blindfolded and gagged, he wouldn't even know who fired the gun. Their only engagement from his perspective, should be that the teenager pointed him out on the bus. Doesn't seem like its worth the effort\n\nOne part I didn't understand, when Isabel escaped the convoy during the firefight, another man covered in blood first found her and tried to force her into his car before Alejandro shot him, who was that dude?? Seemed like he appeared out of nowhere.\n\nEdit : I just remembered, close to the ending, Matt's superior Cynthia told him to shut down the operation and cut off loose ends, and also revealed that the terrorists were actually US citizens, not foreign nationals. Like wtf?? So this whole operation happened due to faulty intel??",

From the eerie silence to the blood-soaked chaos, every scene builds dread. It\u2019s not your typical vampire movie there\u2019s no romance or charm here, just raw survival and horror.

        "title": "Mississippi Burning ( 1988 ) starring Gene Hackman, Willem Dafoe, Michael Rooker, Brad Dourif, and a young Darius McCrary.",
        "content": "Mississippi Burning is a somewhat fictionalized account of the real-life slayings of three civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964. Hackman and Dafoe play two FBI agents who tirelessly try to track down the three missing young men, only to later learn ( with the help of an informant ) that they were all brutally murdered.\n\nAgent Ward ( Dafoe ) like to do things \"by the book\" whereas agent Anderson ( Hackman ) tends to play more fast and loose with the rules. This leads to a violent clash between them early on, before they reach an uneasy truce. Ward is the brains while Anderson is the muscle.\n\nAll the villains in this film are despicable, but IMO Frank Bailey ( Rooker ) is the worst. On top of being a violent homophobic racist thug, he's a complete psychopath. Absolutely batshit crazy on top of being pure evil. Anyone who would proudly brag to a *federal agent* about being willing to murder innocent people in cold blood simply for wanting the right to vote, and then physically assaulting / threatening that same agent, is definitely a few fries short of a Happy Meal. The only time that I ever saw Frank show any humanity is the remorseful look he had while witnessing the brutal beating that Deputy Pell ( Dourif ) gives his wife.\n\nAnderson taught him a hard lesson in that bar. Anderson was tough enough as he was, but I often wonder things would've played out if agent Anderson was an absolute loose cannon similar to detective Wendell \"Bud\" White ( Russell Crowe ) from *L.A Confidential*. I also wonder how many black customers that Frank got at his auto repair shop, knowing what a hateful bigot he was.\n\nFinally- what do you guys think *really* happened to Mayor Tilman ( R. Lee Ermey ). Did he take his own life out of guilt, shame, and fear, or did his Klan cronies whack him for snitching?",

        "content": "Mine: Fight Club\n\nI was absolutely that guy that would ask a girlfriend to come over just to watch Fight Club for the first time. It encapsulated everything I loved: Punk, rage, anti-consumerism, violence, David Fincher, anarchy and a shared philosophy that we were nothing more than smart monkeys playing house to cope with existential dread. \n\nFast forward to my late teens: I finally decide to read the book and learn about chuck Palahniuk. Completely flips the script on my viewpoint: \u201cThis is a borderline erotic love story about two dysfunctional men cohabiting amidst terrible mental health issues AND was written by a gay man. How did I never know this? - Made me fall in love with it all over again, because the idea of such a hypermasculine movie beloved by dudes everywhere not catching the subliminal gay undertones and examination of their own poor mental health was absolutely incredible. \n\nFast forward to my late 20s: #Metoo has happened, mass shootings every other day in America, men\u2019s health is at an all time low and hypermasculinity is veering into toxic sexist bullshit. I watch Fight Club again and can\u2019t help but think it inadvertently fetishized some of what\u2019s happening in the world today, maybe even influencing it to a small extent considering the zeitgeist.\n\nMy opinion today: It\u2019s an artistic commentary on the decline of men\u2019s mental health over the last 3 decades. I can only vaguely identify with the characters now, which to me is a good thing. While I\u2019ll always consider it an incredible film (Arguably Finchers Best outside of 7even) and a personal favorite, my hope is that it\u2019ll become more of a PSA and less of mantra for young men over the course of time. \n",

It\u2019s one of the grittiest and most intense war films I\u2019ve seen, visually brutal, emotionally heavy, and incredibly immersive. The way it captures the tension inside that tank, the exhaustion, the fear, and the slow erosion of humanity really hits hard. I get that it\u2019s not as polished or uplifting as some other war movies but maybe that\u2019s the point. For those who\u2019ve seen it, did it leave a strong impression on you too or did it miss the mark somehow?\n\n",

        "content": "Every once in a while I\u2019ll remember a movie that got announced years ago, made a bunch of noise... and then just disappeared. Like it was gonna be a thing, people were attached, maybe even a script got written, and then nothing. Either it\u2019s technically still \u201cin development\u201d or it quietly died and no one said anything.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s easily the 21 Jump Street / Men in Black crossover. That\u2019s such a stupid idea but also exactly the kind of stupid I love. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill somehow getting wrapped up in alien stuff? That could\u2019ve been gold. And there was real talk of it happening. Like script written, people attached, it almost existed. What the hell happened??\n\nThere\u2019s a bunch of others that pop into my head from time to time, stuff like Guillermo del Toro\u2019s Lovecraft movie, Fincher doing a Jules Verne thing, or all those weird Star Wars spinoffs that probably died the second someone changed jobs at Disney. And then there\u2019s stuff like Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian, which sounds insane but apparently almost existed?\n\nAnd there\u2019s so many others. Whole graveyard of weird, wild, or straight-up insane projects that almost happened. Most of them probably wouldn\u2019t have even worked, but I still wish we got to see the mess.\n\nWhat\u2019s the one for you? The movie that got scrapped, delayed to death, or is still fake-alive in \u201cdevelopment\u201d that you\u2019d instantly buy a ticket for if it suddenly came back?\n\n",

        "title": "If you like horror movies, go see Bring Her Back",
        "content": "Everyone's always complaining about how there's never any original films anymore. I personally contend there are more original films than ever and it's just that no one is bothering to watch them (because you generally have to seek them out more) as the tent poles dwarf their marketing budgets.\n\nAnyway, Bring Her Back (made by the RackaRacka Ronald McDonald Youtube Guys who also made **Talk to Me** a few years ago) is possibky the best horror film I've ever seen. \n\nI do say that as someone who generally isn't a massive fan of the genre though because of all the pure slop. However, I did see Barbarian and Heretic that are maybe my other recent favourites, along with The Black Phone and obviously Talk to Me as well. And I loved the 2020 version of Invisible Man. I quite liked Pearl, didnt like X much though. I've not had a chance to see Weapons or Together yet but I've heard great things about both. Also didnt see Sinners (sorry) which I desperately want to watch now.\n\nI say all of this only to maybe help you gauge my taste and see if it aligns with yours.\n\nSo.. onto the actual film. It's unbelievably tense. There's like one or two jumpscares in the entire film, the rest of it is pure tension, mostly between the few of the main characters that are there. The performances are fantastic all around, even from the children. I felt on my edge the entire time, even in moments of levity or just when people are generally talking. It just always feels like there's *something* off.\n\nAnd then there's the gore. If you've seen Talk to Me or their Youtube stuff you know what they're capable of on this front. Some of the imagery in this film is permanently seared into my eyes.\n\nIn a weird way, the film reminded me a bit of Sinister (the Ethan Hawke one). People who have seen it could probably see why.\n\nWhat I really love though is how disciplined it is. No bloat. Just really solid direction and film-making. It consistently keeps choosing the clean, mean option. A scene starts simple, two people just talking, and then a word lands wrong, or goes one beat too long, and suddenly you could snap the tension in the room. By the time anything violent actually pops, you\u2019re already terrified, which makes it feel ten times worse.\n\nAnd lastly, I guess it's worth talking about the budget. They made this movie for just $15 million and the whole thing is just absolutely impeccably done. The effects put the largest of studios to shame. The fact they've managed to do thus twice in a row shows these guys aren't just messing around and managed to make a fluke with Talk To Me. They're seriously good filmmakers and I can't wait to see what they do next.\n\n\n\n",
