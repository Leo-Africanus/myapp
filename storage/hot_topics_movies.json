It came out like 17 years ago (holy shit, I\u2019m old), so does it stand the test of time?\n\nEdit: for all the people wondering why I said \u201cactually\u201d, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve seen people boycotting it lately, or even saying it\u2019s shit because of Brand (these people probably haven\u2019t even seen the movie themselves). It\u2019s always been a highly-rated movie, and rightly so. ",

I saw it in theaters with my brother in 2012 (fuck that's a long time ago) and have rewatched it oodles of times since then. The chemistry between the cast is fantastic, Jonah Hill and Channing \"Tateyum\" play off each other so well and seems to have had a great time filming.\n\nNic Offerman as Deputy Chief Hardy is just incredible casting. The not so subtle jabs at Hollywood remakes is hilarious. \n\nAlso I didn't recognize Dakota Johnson...I must of been finger poppin' somebody's asshole and didn't notice.\n\nThe scene stealer is Ice Cube. Every line he has is gold and is insanely quotable.\n\nIt such a shame the MIB/21 Jump Street crossover never came to fruition...anyways I'm off to watch 22 Jump Street.",

        "content": "Buster Keaton being famous for his courage and willignness to pull of some crazy stunts, giving us some of the best slapstick and stunt comedy films ever made. To this date there hasn't been anybody nearly at his level (and courage) to pull off some of the things he did. \n\nThe closest to him currently is Tom Cruise who has become well known (among other things) for his own willingness to pull of some crazy stunts. As the Mission Impossible series has shown us, as well as Top Gun and other films, Tom Cruise is always pushing his own limits and challenging his own capabilities in his stunt work, all for the sake of cinema. \n\nFor that reason, I would LOVE to see a modern Buster Keaton style slapstick film, feeling like Tom Cruise is the only one with the capability to pull it off. What made Buster Keaton films so great was both the stunts and also the dry deadpan humor. Keaton's stoicism to the chaos around him is something we've seen with Leslie Nielsen in Airplane/Naked Gun. \n\nLeslie Nielsen experienced a career renaissance that made him a household name in comedy, despite having no comedic chops himself. Simply because he used deadpan humor and being the every man who pretends like everything is normal as the chaos unfolds around him.\n\nThis is where I think Tom Cruise would be perfect to do a Buster Keaton style film. As an action star Tom Cruise isn't well known for his comedic chops, but he doesn't need to be. He can maintain the deadpan seriousness and stoicism of Buster Keaton and Leslie Nielson reacting to the craziness happening around him and showing off his stunting capabilities in increasingly absurd situations.

They tell stories that are highly charged with emotion and thus lend themselves to making the audience cry. But then there are movies where crying is seemingly not the intention, and yet you can't help but feel your eyes well up in tears.\n\nThe Godfather Part 2 is called a lot of things: The best sequel ever made, one of the best movies of the 70's, The Great American Movie. But a tearjerker? From the outset it doesn't really look it. And yet, if you find yourself sucked into Michael Corleone's inner turmoil as I was, it becomes surprisingly easy to become emotional the further along you go in. ESPECIALLY when&gt;!Michael gives the implicit order to kill Fredo, and before he meets his inevitable fate, his attempts to connect with Michael's son.!&lt;I'll admit, I wept. I wept pretty hard, and I did NOT expect that reaction from The Godfather 2. What movie was like that for you?",

        "content": "I was made to watch *The King of Kings* yesterday, and I\u2019m still processing the fact that someone watched *The Passion of the Christ* and thought:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s do that again. But make it adorable.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no mystery to what this is\u2014it\u2019s a sermon dressed as an animated film. Imagine if *The Prince of Egypt* had less artistry, less heart, and more of that weird Sunday school energy where you\u2019re afraid to ask questions. That\u2019s this.\n\nThe movie starts with Charles Dickens (yes, really) telling his kids bedtime stories about Jesus, which somehow becomes the framing device for a full-on Gospel recap. The animation? Think *Pixar meets Playmobil*. Big heads. Smooth, rubbery faces. That eerie uncanny valley where everyone looks like they were designed in a Christian metaverse.\n\nBut the tone is the real kicker. One second you\u2019re watching cartoon kids giggle at the manger. The next, Jesus is being flogged behind a post by a dead-eyed Roman doll with a whip. When they lift Funko-Jesus onto the cross, I actually said \u201cno way\u201d out loud.\n\nThis movie in the (un)holy baby of tonal mismatch and weird choices: Roman officials are \u201ccomplex,\u201d but every Jewish character who questions Jesus is a full-on villain with the face of a propaganda sketch. That\u2019s not subtext. That\u2019s just text.\n\nTo be clear: If you want to show this to your kids, fine. But don\u2019t pretend this is a movie. It\u2019s a delivery system for doctrine. And at times, it feels like the kind of doctrine that doesn\u2019t trust children to think for themselves.\n\nThis\u2019ll be sold as wholesome family entertainment. Personally? I think it\u2019s a little terrifying.",

A few movies I think deserve to be in the conversation: 13 Assassins, I Saw the Devil, Upgrade (fight choreography is unique) and The Night Comes for Us.\n\nDoesn\u2019t necessarily have to be an action movie, you can include a horror if you think it has a fight sequence worth mentioning.

        "title": "Boiling Point (2021) pulls off a 90 minute single take and is probably my favorite movie with this \"gimmick\"",
        "content": "Decided to watch this after being super impressed with director Philip Barantini's work on the Netflix show Adolescence. The way he stages and blocks his actors in order to pull off this technical feat is nothing short of brilliant. The movie is incredibly tense, set in a single night in a busy restaurant, and the camerawork massively contributes to this overwhelming sense of dread that lingers over every scene. Stephen Graham and Vinette Robinson are absolutely magnetic as the head chef and sous chef, Robinson especially absolutely kills it during this one scene where she delivers the most realistic frustrated monologue I think I've ever watched (I think she flubs a couple lines but it added to the sense of realism, I often stumble over my words when angry, too). I've seen a few films that try this same gimmick - Birdman is fantastic, Victoria is awesome, 1917 is masterful. But while those movies are technical marvels in their own rights and maybe manage to pull off some flashier camera moves, none of them made me feel as claustrophobic and tense as this one. The simple, familiar setting, the naturalistic dialogue where people talk over each other and fumble their words, the sound design emphasizing the bustle of a busy restaurant. All of it gels into a single 90 minute heart attack, in the spirit of the Safdie Brothers.",
