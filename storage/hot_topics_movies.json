        "content": "Just rewatched American History X after a few years. The thing that struck me the most, is how well it's aged. Everything about it is carefully and artfully crafted. The two most powerful bits, in my opinion, are the dinner table discussions. The first with the mother's boyfriend, and the second with her late husband. Showing how racism and hate is often twisted and packaged behind pseudo-economic and perceived inequality tinged hatred, and then, how it begins. Learned at home. And throughout the film, you see where that gets you: absolutely nowhere. And the ending is just heart wrenching, the cycle never ends. Highly encourage a rewatch. The cinematography, the soundtrack, the use of monochrome, it's all funneled into an ugly look of America's dark side. And it's more poignant in these times that it's ever been.",

        "content": "*A woman's obsessive search for her missing sister leads her into a terrifying mystery at the hands of an unknown evil.*\n\nCast: Camille Sullivan, Keith David, Michael Bleach\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [83%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shelby_oaks/reviews)\n\n**Metacritic:** [N/A (updating)](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/shelby-oaks/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Slashfilm - BJ Colangelo](https://www.slashfilm.com/1626527/shelby-oaks-review/) \\- 8 / 10\n\n&gt;It's clear that Chris Stuckmann loves horror and has taken his years of determining what he likes and what he thinks \"works\" by reviewing films on YouTube to shape his craft. At no point does it feel like \"Shelby Oaks\" is anything other than the very best version of what he intended to make, as opposed to the numerous films by first-time feature filmmakers who spend too much time trying to make something they *think* they're supposed to make. The result is a deeply unsettling view that never loses its sense of heart or humanity. With Sullivan's phenomenal performance and Stuckmann's keen eye, \"Shelby Oaks\" allows us to witness the start of one of the most promising new voices in horror.\n\n[Gizmodo - German Lussier](https://gizmodo.com/shelby-oaks-puts-a-satisfying-scary-spin-on-the-found-footage-genre-2000661720)\n\n&gt;This is a horror film for and by the YouTube generation: one that\u2019s inspired by many horror films of the past, with little regard for when or how to borrow from them. As long as it\u2019s cool and scary. Which *Shelby Oaks* is.\n\n[Polygon - Jake Kleinman](https://www.polygon.com/shelby-oaks-review-chris-stuckmann/)\n\n&gt;Overall, Stuckmann\u2019s directorial debut is a sturdy horror movie from a lover of film who clearly understands the genre. While the involvement of indie distributor Neon and producer Mike Flanagan must have gone a long way (For a sense of what the original version of *Shelby Oaks* was like, you can read the mostly positive reviews from its initial premiere at 2024\u2019s Fantasia International Film Festival), there\u2019s strong evidence of talent \u2014 and cinematic depravity \u2014 to be seen.\n\n[RogerEbert - Brian Tallerico](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/shelby-oaks-chris-stuckmann-fantastic-fest-movie-review-2025) \\- 2 / 4\n\n&gt;Stuckmann is a smart dude, and one has to admire the commitment to getting this film made. He\u2019ll bounce back, especially given he\u2019s now been given a thumbs-up by Neon. He was also smart enough to give character actor Keith David a movie-stealing scene as the former prison warden who tells Mia about how his facility went to shit and how one of his inmates might have been possessed. A movie about a guy trying to run a haunted prison might have felt more original than this retread. Maybe they can explore that idea in the sequel. At least it\u2019s a new one.",

        "content": "*Bad dreams haunt 15-year-old Gwen as she receives calls from the black phone and sees disturbing visions of three boys being stalked at a winter camp.*\n\nDirector: Scott Derrickson\n\nCast: Ethan Hawke, Mason Thames, Miguel Mora\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [100% (9 reviews)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/black_phone_2)\n\n**Metacritic:** [73 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/black-phone-2/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Slashfilm - Rafael Motamayor](https://www.slashfilm.com/1974280/black-phone-2-review/) \\- 9 / 10\n\n&gt;The most impressive feat Black Phone 2 pulls off is finding a way to bring The Grabber back that feels coherent and actually adds to the character. We get some backstory on the child-abductor that comes across as deepening the character rather than just answering questions that no one asked.\n\n[RogerEbert - Brian Tallerico](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/black-phone-2-movie-review-2025) \\- 3 / 4\n\n&gt;It\u2019s a tick too long and has a section that\u2019s far too expository for a film that\u2019s at its best when it leans into surreal nightmare logic, but this weird movie works its fear factor in unexpected, creative ways.\n\n[IndieWire - Katie Rife](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/the-black-phone-2-horror-movie-review-1235152348/)\n\n&gt;a complaint that\u2019s also common to contemporary horror films nags at \u201cBlack Phone 2,\u201d in that all of the best things about this movie come from other movies, whether they be the creative team\u2019s previous efforts or iconic titles from decades past. These elements are enjoyable, which is precisely why they\u2019re recycled here. And maybe that\u2019s good enough for a horror sequel. But good enough will never be more than just that.\u00a0",
