        "content": "Okay, gotta ask \u2013 what are those movies that burrowed under your skin and left a truly unsettling mark? The kind that\u00a0**legit**\u00a0give you chills\u00a0years\u00a0after you first saw them?\n\n**NGL**, for me, the top two that have had this lasting effect are\u00a0hands down\u00a0 **The Truman Show** and **Westworld\u00a0(the series)**.\n\nThey seriously messed with my head back when I watched them, and even now, years down the line, I still get this lingering, creepy feeling sometimes. It planted this seed of doubt... like,\u00a0**what if I'm just an NPC?**\u00a0What if most of us regular folks are just background characters in some massive simulation or game?\n\nIt's made me look at the world differently ever since. Maybe those super-rich people or powerful politicians constantly\u00a0**on the feed**\u00a0aren't just regular people, but the\u00a0actual\u00a0players? The ones with\u00a0**P2W (Pay-to-Win)**\u00a0advantages, or maybe even avatars controlled by the\u00a0**devs/admins**\u00a0running the whole show, walking among us\u00a0**IRL**?\n\nIt's a properly chilling thought that these movies planted in my brain all that time ago, and it genuinely still gives me goosebumps just thinking about it.\n\nAnyone else have a movie do this to them? Left you with a deep unease or a creepy thought that revisits you long after you watched it? Which ones were they?\n\n**TL;DR:**\u00a0**The Truman Show**\u00a0and\u00a0**Westworld**\u00a0still creep me out years later, making me wonder if we're NPCs and the rich/powerful are the real players/admins. What movies give you long-lasting chills?",

I saw it in theaters with my brother in 2012 (fuck that's a long time ago) and have rewatched it oodles of times since then. The chemistry between the cast is fantastic, Jonah Hill and Channing \"Tateyum\" play off each other so well and seems to have had a great time filming.\n\nNic Offerman as Deputy Chief Hardy is just incredible casting. The not so subtle jabs at Hollywood remakes is hilarious. \n\nAlso I didn't recognize Dakota Johnson...I must of been finger poppin' somebody's asshole and didn't notice.\n\nThe scene stealer is Ice Cube. Every line he has is gold and is insanely quotable.\n\nIt such a shame the MIB/21 Jump Street crossover never came to fruition...anyways I'm off to watch 22 Jump Street.",

        "content": "I think Cynthia Rothrock was able to do well in Hong Kong because she got dubbed so her acting didn't come across as badly as it did in the American movies she did. \n\nShe's a phenomenal fighter, probably the best martial arts movie star the World has ever had. I love Michelle Yeoh but she is not a real fighter like Cynthia, she's more of a dancer in the same vein as Zhang Ziyi. That said, Cynthia Rothrock is a mediocre actress. \n\nAnd in Hollywood, she mostly did DTV movies. THe China O'Brien films, that one she did where she played a bodyguard to some rich dude which was so bad that it was a chore to watch it to the end. \n\nHad Rothrock worked with the likes of Albert Pyun, Tsui Hark, Roland Emmerich, she might have done better. Jean Claude Van DAmme isn't much of an actor but he got good directors that made the best out of him.",

        "content": "last year, i made a post on this sub about logistics, an experimental movie that holds the distinction of being the longest feature film of all time. however, you may be inclined to wonder what the longest movie with an actual plot is. well, that honor goes to the 2019 indian drama amra ekta cinema banabo, which roughly translates to we will make a film.\n\nwritten and directed by ashraf shishir, the film tells the story of a man living in the 1970s in post liberation war bangladesh. after being overcome with guilt about killing an ant, he meet an aspiring filmmaker who insist that life is just one big movie with god as the director. the filmmaker wants to make a movie and tells the man that he should be the hero of the film if he wants to repent for his sins. cue shenanigans.\n\nthe film's runtime is a whopping 21 hours. that's right. this movie about a guy feeling bad that he killed an ant is going to take you a vast majority of the day to watch. the film was shot over the course of 9 years beginning in 2009 and had no less then 4,000 crew members. \n\nas for the reception, the film currently boasts a 7 out of 10 on IMDB but a 49% on rotten tomatoes. make of that what you will.",

        "content": "We all know the big tearjerker movies: Up and Schindler's List and all accompanying Pixar/Holocaust movies. They tell stories that are highly charged with emotion and thus lend themselves to making the audience cry. But then there are movies where crying is seemingly not the intention, and yet you can't help but feel your eyes well up in tears.\n\nThe Godfather Part 2 is called a lot of things: The best sequel ever made, one of the best movies of the 70's, The Great American Movie. But a tearjerker? From the outset it doesn't really look it. And yet, if you find yourself sucked into Michael Corleone's inner turmoil as I was, it becomes surprisingly easy to become emotional the further along you go in. ESPECIALLY when&gt;!Michael gives the implicit order to kill Fredo, and before he meets his inevitable fate, his attempts to connect with Michael's son.!&lt;I'll admit, I wept. I wept pretty hard, and I did NOT expect that reaction from The Godfather 2. What movie was like that for you?",

        "content": "Who here has seen this one? I think it's excellent! Brendan Frazer does an amazing acting job as always, as does Elizabeth Hurley as the Devil, not to mention that she was drop-dead gorgeous! This is a remake of a movie from 1967 with the same title, starring Dudley Moore and Peter Cook, who played the Devil in that one. The original is also quite good, but I'd say not as good as the remake, though they're pretty much the same story, i.e., a pathetic nobody gets offered seven wishes from the Devil in exchange for their soul, but the Devil makes all their wishes go bad, though at the end, everything works out for both innocent characters (no spoilers here!) to the detriment of the Devil, who needs to look for another soul.\n\nOne thing I prefer about the remake, besides the Devil being played by a very hot woman, is that I thought it was quite thought-provoking concerning good, evil, and what really matters in life. Although I'm not religious and I don't believe in the Devil, at least not literally, I do believe in good and evil and I think we all face a battle between them, and ultimately we all need to decide which path to take and what really matters in our lives, which is what I think both movies are trying to say, but I think the 2000 remake says it better.",
