        "title": "How did Taylor Sheridan go from writing heartbreaking, thoughtful, and poignant films to writing disposable, propagandistic, soap operas?",
        "content": "My first exposure to Taylor Sheridan was 2015's \\*Sicario\\*. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, \\*Sicario\\* is a bleak story about the ultimate collapse of jurisdiction, legality, and morality around the War on Drugs as national elements and interests slowly degrade into pure power politics. It has been called the \\*Apocalypse Now\\* of the War on Drugs, and while I don't think \\*Sicario\\* is quite a film of that caliber I do think the comparison stands as legitimate.\n\nThe year after \\*Sicario\\* was released, 2016, saw the release of a crime tragedy set in West Texas titled \\*Hell or High Water\\*, directed by David Mackenzie. \\*Hell or High Water\\* is a great films, as all of the performances, settings, and dialogue create a sincere and disturbing look at rural poverty in America. The film, ostensibly a heist film, features characters fully formed from the land which reared them. The cars they drive, the way they talk, and clothes they wear all appear to the audience as sincere to the setting and theme.  The climactic refrain of the film is poignant, \"I've been poor my whole life, like a disease passing from generation to generation. But not my boys, not anymore.\"\n\nAnd the year after that we have 2017's \\*Wind River\\*, directed by Sheridan himself. I have mixed feelings about this film. It tackles the topic, that of the murder of Indigenous women on western reservations, with the appropriate weight and despair. At times it \\*almost\\* rises to the level of Cormac McCarthy and Larry McMurtry in terms of the grandiosity and profound sorrow in the western cannon. It is a film which is so tense at times it almost feels like your back is about to shatter from the strain. The climactic standoff absolutely deserves it's place in film history. And it features an incredible, but brief, performance by Gil Birmingham as a father who almost seems to be transforming into a being of pure grief. However, \\*Wind River\\* also features Jeremy Renner as a white guy who seems to really believe that he is just as native as the Native Americans he lives with, and while Elizabeth Olsen turns in a good performance as the representative of an uncaring federal government, she plays a far more central role in the plot that the great Graham Greene, whose portrayal of an indigenous police chief is commanding of respect.\n\nBy 2018 Sheridan had three critically acclaimed films under his belt, with one as director and one being nominated for Best Picture. Then he writes the superfluous sequel to \\*Sicario\\* titled \\*Sicario: Day of the Soldado\\*, which failed to make any real impact at all. Importantly, however, \\*Sicario 2\\* reduces the immorality and cynicism from the CIA characters and seemingly is more approving of the institutions he criticized in his own previous screenplay. All in all, a strange and disappointing follow up.\n\nAnd then \\*Yellowstone\\* happens, which launches Sheridan into the stratosphere in terms of fame and income. I hate \\*Yellowstone\\*. I hate how its understanding of the west is seemingly entirely based in the Texan hatred of public land and land conservation. I hate how the show's understanding of the rural working class and ranching is almost entirely seen as violent, confrontational, and libertarian. I hate the militarism of the show . But I think what I hate most is how a man who once wrote a heartbreaking film about rural poverty wasted the opportunity to offer any meaningful examination of life in the rapidly gentrifying American West, and instead became the primary advertiser for that gentrification.\n\nAnd then the rest is history. He's now writing disposable show after disposable show about the virtues of the American military establishment, as well as about the virtues of the oil industry decimating the rural farmland he was once such a mourner of. In \\*Wind River\\* oil rig workers were the racist, murdering, rapists, in \\*Landman\\* they're heroes holding up the American way of life.\n\nBut I know the answer already. It's money. Soap Operas aimed at suburban conservatives sell very well, and \\*Yellowstone\\* is the apotheosis of that genre.",

I felt like that was weird for a Christmas film since it was my first time watching the movie.\n\nIt actually turns out that I was watching the second Santa Clause, not the first one and that how Tim Allen's character becomes Santa Claus was actually in the first movie when I finally got around to it sometime later. I mean, I was a bit shocked when I found that I watched the sequel, not the original later on (though it does happen sometimes).\n\nI have since watched all three of the movies in order and they are good movies to enjoy during the holiday season.

        "content": "I\u2019ve always found it interesting that in a lot of michael bay\u2019s films they somehow feel \u201cmodern\u201d, even decades later. am i the only one who notices this?\n\nI keep wondering if it\u2019s mainly the lighting, the cinematography, or the way the camera moves that gives his movies that clean, look compared to most other films from the 90s. I get the same feeling with The Rock and Armageddon. I know a lot of people don\u2019t consider him a great director, but honestly his movies seem to age surprisingly well.",

Not debating how \u201cgood\u201d these movies are or am after a certain \u201cquality\u201d just halfway decent and fit the theme.\n\n\\-Pirates of the Caribbean franchise (obvious)\n\n\\-Black Sails TV series \n\n\\-Master and Commander\n\n\\-Muppet Treasure Island\n\n\\-Hornblower TV miniseries\n\n\\-Heart of the Sea\n\n\\-Titanic\n\n\\-Perfect Storm\n\n\\-The Bounty\n\nWhat else can I add to this list?\n\nNote: I\u2019ve left off some choices others may seem as obvious such as Life of Pi, Voyage of the Demeter, Captain Phillips etc, due to them not quite having the nautical focus quite as much or having too many other things going on. I like it when the ocean is the heart of the story.\n\nAlso, there are many films that have a sequence or a section that takes place at sea or on a boat, (The New World, certain seasons of Outlander etc,) but is not the main focus.\n\nSimilarly, I do enjoy films that take place on islands or beaches or tropical settings, but I\u2019ve left these off this list as they lack the nautical focus.",

        "content": "Yesterday i rewatched Phantom Thread years and years after the first time i did.\n\nI hated it the first time, because i was excited, and i expected something more similar to There Will Be Blood and The Master, my two favorite PTA films ever, in fact i imagined Anderson would almost close a trilogy of solemn Kubrickian character studies with this one.\n\nOnce i understood what it was aiming for the second time, i loved it.\n\nIt's a delicious and tender portrait of a twisted relationship between two flawed, complicated, toxic, and vulnerable people, a psychological romantic drama in the vein of Hitchcock and Ophuls films.\n\nI don't know maybe i was younger and wanted just more craziness like in Magnolia, Boogie Nights, and Punch-Drunk Love, and more twisted, intense, and entrancing characters like Freddie Quell, Daniel Plainview, and Lancaster Dodd. \n\nBut now at a different phase of my life, i understood the story and the characters, the dynamics between them, the motives and intentions behind their actions, the meanings of certain scenes, etc... \nIt just hit me, i got it.\n\nThe film isn\u2019t about the external drama, it\u2019s about the internal, slow-burn mechanics of obsession and control.\n\nThe second time i've seen the film it hits differently because you\u2019re in a different headspace, more receptive to the nuance, power dynamics, and the quiet cruelty and tenderness of their relationship. \n\nThe way Reynolds and Alma manipulate, hurt, and love each other is so intricately choreographed that it\u2019s basically a psychological pas de deux. \nThat\u2019s what makes the film feel delicious once you understand it.\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis should have won his fourth Oscar, he was believable at every nuance of Reynolds Woodcock, brilliant artist, perfectionist, but also petty, childish, egotistical, manipulative, narcissist, and vulnerable almost like a kid.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t just play Reynolds, he inhabits the contradictions of someone so brilliant and fragile at the same time. \nEvery gesture, every look, every tiny adjustment of posture communicates his internal thoughts and torments.\n\nAnd Vicky Krieps as Alma should have had at least an Oscar nomination, Reynolds's worthy counterpart in this twisted, almost toxic, relationship.\nShe's smart and strong in her subtlety. \n\nTheir chemistry makes the story work, it\u2019s about negotiation, submission, control, and intimacy, not spectacle, big fights, or dramatic twists.\n\n\nHow everyone in the film industry during the Oscar season at the time was fixated on The Shape Of Water and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, but this one didn't sweep all the major categories at the time will always be insane to me.\n\n",
