        "content": "It could be an inclusion done by a director, writer or producer, doesn't matter that much, as long as the pettiness is on full display in the film.\n\nTwo famous examples:\n\nRoland Emmerich had characters mocking critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel added in Godzilla (1998) after the two had criticized some of his earlier films. The characters on-screen are the useless mayor Ebert and his assistant Gene, the latter giving mayor Ebert two thumbs down at the end of the movie. The real life Ebert and Siskel were not impressed, neither by the movie nor their parodies.\n\nBob Fosse's semi-autobiographical All That Jazz (1979) starring Roy Scheider as Bob Fosse stand-in Joe Gideon features a rival Broadway/film director played by John Lithgow. While it was never confirmed who this character was based on, rumours suggest Fosse's Broadway rivals Harold Prince or Michael Bennett, or some amalgamation of the two. Regardless, in a non-pivotal scene Lithgow's character Lucas Sergeant is approached by a fan (much to his ego's excitement), when the fan says:\n\n'Could I have your autograph? I'm an actress, too. You're my favorite director after Joe Gideon. I'm so sorry your show was a flop.'",

        "content": "Video games are a relatively new medium in the grand scheme of things, as such for decades movies were made by people who had never played a video game before, and like many people of their generation they held quite negative attitudes about those darn Nintendos those kids are wasting their time with, and this could be seen in the movies they made. Games would be depicted as childish wastes of time and/or money at best, and violent things that could lead kids to become violent at worst.\n\nAs time went on people that actually grew up playing games starting getting involved in movie production so things became less negative. But these people often didn't play games anymore and thus their understanding of games was quite outdated (think of how many portrayals of \"modern\" games would still use old concepts like levels and lives, as well as 8-bit sound effects, or how many just reference old games and not much else). Things have gotten better in recent years though, since many adults involved in movie production now still play games, and collaborations between Hollywood and video game companies (which are often owned by the same parent company) require games to be portrayed in a more faithful/flattering light.\n\nSo with that in mind, what were the worst portrayals of video games in movies and which were the best/most accurate? What fictional movie game would you actually want to play?\n\nEDIT: Just so we're clear, I am not talking about movies based on video games, but the way video games are depicted in movies.",

And this line plays over the first time we see the guy on screen.\n\nIn that ballistics lecture Colin attends (Matt Damon's first scene), the subject matter being discussed/diagrams being used are that of JFK's head wounds when he was assassinated.\n\nDunno if it can be seen as foreshadowing that Colin will end up killing Costello, but if it is, nice touch.",

I love the feeling of being constantly stressed and locked TF into a movie, where every so often I need to pause to catch my breath. Another one that comes to mind (although it's not a movie) was Chernobyl. Anyways any suggestions?",

        "title": "Phantasm",
        "content": "There's a fair amount of Horror fans here on r/Movies and there must be more than a few who are familiar with this series. One of my very favorite Horror series if not my outright favorite, mainly purely based off of the first two although I also think the third and fourth ones were pretty good as well (and also quite impressive despite their small budgets). The first two always see regular rotation from me every October as part of my Halloween playlist. The Tall Man is definitely among the more unique of the Horror icons and he was played to perfection by the late, great Angus Scrimm throughout all five. The series is such a great blend of surrealism and mind-bending Horror with some fun Action elements sprinkled throughout. And who doesn't love the iconic flying death spheres.\n\nMay as well rank them while I'm at it. For other fans here, how would you rank them? Mine goes:\n\n* Phantasm II\n* Phantasm\n* Phantasm IV: Oblivion\n* Phantasm III: Lord Of The Dead\n* Phantasm V: Ravager\n\n2 has always very easily been my favorite of the series. It's literally not only my favorite Horror film, but one of my favorite movies in general. With the bigger budget you can tell so much more was able to be accomplished. It's like a vintage Survival Horror video game from the 90s as a movie. Just a riot of a movie. I have a lot of love and respect for the original as well, but it's always hard not to look at 2 as being the definitive entry.\n\n3 and 4 are also very good, but the fifth was sadly held back by the clear lack of a budget, but you can tell they tried their damndest. I will say as a lifelong fan the ending of 5 certainly hits hard and brings full-circle the themes of death and loss, which have been prevalent since the first film. It also certainly hits much harder in light of the health issues series star Reggie Bannister has sadly recently suffered. I'm just glad a fifth and final film was finally made after so many years of waiting.",

        "title": "Barry Levinson's 'The Alto Knights' - Review Thread",
        "content": "*The film follows two of New York's most notorious organized crime bosses, Frank Costello (Robert De Niro) and Vito Genovese (De Niro), as they vie for control of the city's streets. Once the best of friends, petty jealousies and a series of betrayals place them on a deadly collision course that will reshape the Mafia (and America) forever.*\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [35%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_alto_knights)\n\n**Metacritic:** [47/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-alto-knights/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/213) \\- [Frank Scheck](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/frank-scheck)\n\n&gt;He\u2019s more than capable of handling the daunting assignment \u2014 he\u2019s De Niro, after all \u2014 but the net effect is ultimately so gimmicky that it saps the movie of its intended seriousness. It\u2019s a fatal miscalculation that consigns *The Alto Knights*, Levinson\u2019s first theatrical film since 2015\u2019s *Rock the Kasbah*, to being a footnote in the distinguished careers of both its director and star.\n\n[Chicago Sun-Times](https://www.metacritic.com/publication/chicago-sun-times/) \\- [Richard Roeper](https://www.metacritic.com/critic/richard-roeper/)\n\n&gt;De Niro infuses Costello with a kind of avuncular charm, while Genovese has the fiery temper and paranoid fury to match Jake La Motta in \u201cRaging Bull.\u201d It\u2019s a privilege to witness one of the best actors of all time, still at the top of his game.\n\n[AwardsWatch](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/3094) \\- [Karen M. Peterson](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/karen-m-peterson)\n\n&gt;With its central gimmick and insistence on telling about events rather than showing them,*The Alto Knights* might have made a moderately entertaining television movie. If expanded and brimming with more detail, development of other characters, and a deeper examination of the similarities and differences between its two leads, this could be a fascinating limited series. Instead, we are left with a lethargic acting exercise that ties together a few good scenes with a string of uninspired exposition.\n\n[Next Best Picture](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/3046) \\- [Cody Dericks](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/cody-dericks)\n\n&gt;Apart from some decent performances, \u201cThe Alto Knights\u201d is unexciting and fails to make a case for its existence. The story is dutifully told via exhausting narration from Frank in a way that makes it seem like not even he is fully invested in telling it.\n\n[Guardian](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/205) \\- [Peter Bradshaw](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/peter-bradshaw)\n\n&gt;There is a kind of solidity and force to the film in its opening act, but its interest dwindles and we get little in the way of either ambition or moment-by-moment humour. There is, however, a sweet, autumnal touch when the melancholy, ageing Frank is forced by his wife to take their dogs for a walk in Central Park in mink coats to keep out the cold.\n\n[Empire](https://www.metacritic.com/publication/empire/) \\- [Laura Venning](https://www.metacritic.com/critic/laura-venning/)\n\n&gt;*The Alto Knights* seems to be aiming for an elegiac tone similar to that of *The Irishman*, nostalgically mourning both a lost time and a neglected film genre. But it finds its groove in its sillier moments, most memorably a farcical sequence of ageing mobsters trying to flee an al fresco meet up in upstate New York where they\u2019ve been cornered by the cops. It\u2019s hardly a return to the golden age of gangsters, but it\u2019s always a pleasure to see De Niro toast his rivals\u2019 downfall.\n\n[Slashfilm](https://www.metacritic.com/publication/slashfilm/) \\- [Chris Evangelista](https://www.metacritic.com/critic/chris-evangelista/)\n\n&gt;I suppose there's something comfy and cozy about \"The Alto Knights\" \u2014 it's the type of sleepy dad movie that can easily be watched from a worn-in armchair through half-closed eyelids on a rainy afternoon. The type of movie your father naps through and then says \"It was okay\" after you ask him how it was. In other words, there's nothing offensively bad about \"The Alto Knights\" ... but you kind of wish there was, because at least that might've made the movie more interesting.\n\n[The Daily Beast](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2345) \\- [Nick Schager](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/nick-schager)\n\n&gt;Not wanting to proceed with Frank and Vito is a relatable feeling throughout *The Alto Knights*, whose dawdling pace is almost as extreme as its over-the-top acting. Everyone involved is doing fourth-rate mobster schtick, led by De Niro in lead performances that allow him to squint (and double squint) in virtually every frame.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/226) \\- [David Ehrlich](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/david-ehrlich)\n\n&gt;Levinson\u2019s film is too busy laying the past to rest to bring it back to life, and \u201cThe Alto Knights\u201d is never flatter or more overfamiliar than when it\u2019s doing the things that should feel like gimmies to a well-heeled gangster film. It\u2019s almost as if Frank can\u2019t fathom why anyone today should care about the incredible true story of how some enterprising immigrants without a nickel to their names formed a multi-billion-dollar racket that shaped a huge part of 20th century America. The tragedy of \u201cThe Alto Knights\u201d is that Levinson can\u2019t either.\n\n[Collider](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/1982) \\- [Aidan Kelley](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/aidan-kelley)\n\n&gt;It's a real shame that *The Alto Knights* doesn't explore its real-life story as thoroughly as it should have, as there is a genuinely interesting story to tell here. The film details historical events that didn't just dramatically impact the shadowy world of organized crime, it changed the public perception of the Mafia forever. *The Alto Knights* perhaps would have been better served if it had been a documentary narrated by one Robert De Niro instead of a meandering feature film that stars two.\n\n[Independent (UK)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/691) \\- [Clarisse Loughrey](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/clarisse-loughrey)\n\n&gt;Pileggi\u2019s screenplay and Levinson\u2019s scattershot direction, like De Niro, make little out of the clash of ideologies at the film\u2019s centre. What could be biblical, feels passionless. We spend almost no time with the men in their younger, fonder years. Sure, *The Alto Knights* might provide double the De Niro, but you could easily achieve the same effect by playing *Goodfellas* and *Casino* on two screens side by side. It would be about as cohesive an experience.\n\n[Variety](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/466) \\- [Peter Debruge](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/peter-debruge)\n\n&gt;If there was any doubt as to De Niro\u2019s greatness, it\u2019s laid to rest in these face-to-face confrontations. No star could\u2019ve held his own quite so effectively against De Niro. These surreal staring matches reach beyond the two characters, encompassing the full range of a filmography from which there seems to be no retirement, just bold late-career risks from a professional gambler.",
