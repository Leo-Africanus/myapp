It felt empty, incoherent, jumping from event to event without being embedded in a proper story arc that connected everything. It was a huge disappointment for me. Now I just noticed that a Director's Cut exists, which leaves me twisted: I'm kinda interested to see whether that cut makes up for the weaknesses of the original... But then again I wouldn't wanna waste yet another 3,5 hours. Has anyone been able to compare the two versions yet? ",

And after seeing this movie 6 times, try as I might, I cannot figure out how the *Last* part of the title references the plot of the actual movie. So it feels like the ending and the title itself all tell the audience that this is Indiana Jones' happy ending. \n\nWith such a symbolically conclusive ending, a philosophical line has to be drawn. Barring a truly amazing legacy sequel ala Top Gun: Maverick, should they have left well enough alone at The Last Crusade?",

        "content": "I can't count the number of times when I go into a movie expecting one thing and ending up getting something very different. The trailer can be deceiving, so can be comments from fans and critical reviewers. \n\nBut there been situations I've been pleasantly surprised, where I initially read the premise and thought  I'll skip it because the premise sounded bad (boring, stupid, extreme, absurd) but ended up seeing it years later on TV and I was like Wow, can't believe that premise worked!\n\nCase in point the movie Lobster. I won't say it's my favorite but it was definitely worth watching. And the premise is so weird. It's about a bunch of people forced to pick a romantic partner in a short time because the alternative is they will turn into animals. Of course you can laugh at it but it's played serious, which creates a situation that is absurd and yet you can't look away from it. \n\nIt's almost like you decide to pretend you're a cloud or something, but then you do it so well that people being to wonder what it would mean IF you were a cloud. It's almost the opposite of the situation where someone takes a serious theme, like child abuse, and does such a bad job (bad script, editing, casting choices) that it doesn't connect with people at all. \n\nThat's why I like movies with a seemingly bad or weak premise that turns out well. I think that's art, to be able to make me see something or think about it or care about it, when I would not have otherwise.",

        "content": "The general sentiment around the Craig era is that Casino Royale and Skyfall are masterpieces and the other films are either just \"okay\" or downright stupid/boring, definitely not must-rewatch material like the first and third.\n\nI couldn't help but notice that after Skyfall there seemed to be a misguided tonal shift. The first three movies definitely were trying to go for a more grounded-in-reality approach with real life stakes that felt relatable to our modern world (Terrorists/African warlords/Foreign coups). They definitely wanted to ditch the mustache-twirling evil-lair campiness of the earlier bond films in favor of making them as realistic as possible. They even hang a lampshade on this in Skyfall when Q says \"A gun and a radio. What were you expecting an exploding pen? We don't really go for that anymore.\"\n\nHowever in the last two films, they seem to ditch this attempt at over-realism and lean back into the campiness of the old era with notable silly/campy plot points such as the sinister shadowy men sitting around a giant golden table, or a killer nano-robot virus that targets DNA, or machines that can wipe your memories/mind-control you. The gadgets themselves also seem to have taken a 180. Despite them poking fun at the campiness of the older bond films with their high tech gadgets, they end up going back on it and added silly gadgets like the magical magnet balls that allow you float like in zero-gravity.\n\nKeep in mind there is nothing wrong with this approach if you wanted the whole franchise to be like this but the over-the-top campiness of the last two (and arguably bits of the third) definitely clash with the tone that was initially established in the first movie.\n\nThe later bond movies also seem to have an obsession with bond as a character with a sort of \"he's key to all of this\" approach whereas in the first couple movies Bond was just a normal expendable but highly-competent agent. They also pull the \"everything is connected\" card, and claim all the villains from the first movies were all secretly working together instead of just letting them stand on their own and have their own motivations.\n\nFor me personally, I got so attached to the way the first movie was presented that I just couldn't get on board with the last couple. I don't know how we went from targeting financial operations of terrorists to trying to stop killer micro robot infection missiles, and the jarring shift in tone is just too much for me to overlook as someone who prefers the more grounded movies.\n\nI still watch Casino Royale and Skyfall to this day, but I never had any desire to rewatch any of the others. Am I alone in this?",

Needless to say the entire train robbery sequence is brilliantly shot, you feel the edge of seat excitement, as the 5 men, attempt to pull it off, stumbling at places, but do manage it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m3mvo9iq4zae1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46800889caf3c302d78a0a2552da26f39550462a\n\nThe train sequence apart, there are a lot of good action scenes too, especially the cat and mouse game between the Mexican military and the 5 guys, the near misses.\n\nThe movie has some pretty poignant scenes too, one being where the residents of a village, migrate en masse, to escape the wrath of the military for sheltering the 5 guys.  As also some scenes showing the atrocities inflicted by the military on the prisoners and peasants.\n\nThe sequences and bonding between the 5 guys, is well depicted too, as you keep rooting for them to pull off the mission.\n\nEnnio Morricone's music is perfect for the movie, especially the opening credits with montages of the Mexican revolution shown.\n\nThis is the kind of fun movie, perfect for the weekend, to relax with, as you get drawn into a crazy ride of adventure and action.",

Couldn\u2019t really recall anything that happened. \n\nThen, I just rewatched it the other night, and I\u2019ve since had 2 kids. And it\u2019s such a beautiful story about family and value of time. Full on convulse cried. It hits different. \n\nHad a similar reaction to Interstellar. ",

The movie is well reviewed, had an immensely popular lead (Gosling) along with a familiar Hollywood legend (Crowe) yet it doesn\u2019t seem to have reached the fame or icon status of a Superbad or The Hangover. In fact, it sold so poorly that they didn\u2019t even make a sequel. I guess my question is why? And is the transcendent, blockbuster comedy movie dead?",

But I was completely hypnotized from 15 minutes in all the way until the end. I would actually say the movie only got better and better as it went on. I can\u2019t stop thinking about it and I know it\u2019s a movie I\u2019ll watch again and again and again \n\nBut it is true, nothing really happens. If you\u2019re a fan of beautiful cinematography though, I would check it out anyway because it\u2019s hilarious and entertaining enough to not really not all these intricate relationships and drama and romance. Easily an all time favorite ",

        "content": "I just want to take a moment and appreciate Harrison Ford. In my opinion, he is the best every man action hero that I can recall in cinema. His most iconic characters aren\u2019t the best of the best at every single thing. Even when he wins the fight, he usually has taken a beating throughout and barely manages to make it out alive. The fight choreography is really clumsy, just like how an everyman character should be. I personally love when he throws a haymaker and almost falls over.\n\nIndiana Jones is an academic first and foremost. Deckard is a cop. Han is a smuggler. Jack Ryan is an analyst. His characters find themselves in extraordinary circumstances but you never find their involvement unbelievable. His character is just lucky to make it to see another day. They show confidence in the skills they should and he perfectly portrays when he\u2019s out of his depth. His character finds themselves grit to go on because it\u2019s the right thing to do, but he hopes for the best without knowing he\u2019ll win in the end.\n\nI love watching the over the top action spectacles from time to time where the main hero breezes through waves of bad guys and has the best one liners. But if the goal is to see yourself in a character, I think Harrison Ford is the best action hero of his generation.",
