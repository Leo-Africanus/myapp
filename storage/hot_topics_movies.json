        "title": "I rewatched all of Tom Cruise\u2019s films from Endless Love (1981) to Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning (2023) and ranked the 295 running moments in his filmography.",
        "content": "Earlier this year, in anticipation of the release of [*Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning*](https://youtu.be/fsQgc9pCyDU), I decided to rank all of Tom Cruise\u2019s running scenes in the *M:I* franchise. I\u2019d worked on several *M:*I data pieces for various companies and figured it would be easy to rank the 100ish running moments. When the list was completed - it felt incomplete, so I decided to rank all of the running scenes in his filmography. Starting with 1981\u2019s *Endless Love*, and finishing with 2023's *Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning*. Cruise had gone to extreme lengths for his films, so I decided to honor his hard work by putting together this absurd list.\n\n**Quick note** \\- His X handle always makes me laugh\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nipy05v8czwe1.png?width=762&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98ad8d85fd8050287ab4770953933c0844f559f1\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the list:\n\n* I found and ranked 295 moments\u00a0\n* I counted running, sprinting and jogging. The amount of time doesn\u2019t matter either. In *Top Gun* there\u2019s a one-second shot of [him running to hit a volleyball](https://youtu.be/okyLAKclleo). It was included.\u00a0\n* A short blurb was included for list items 295 - 26\n* Timestamps have been included for the top 25. Some of the timestamps may be a little off for you. It depends on where/how you watch the movies. For me, it was a mixture of DVDs, Blu-rays, Vudu and streaming channels.\u00a0\n* I researched the top 10 scenes and wrote more about them (and included YouTube links)\n* This list is obviously subjective, but after going through Cruise\u2019s filmography for the fourth time since 2018, I am very happy with the top 10\n* There is zero chance that our lists will match up, so don\u2019t be surprised if the 295 moments don\u2019t line up with your list.\u00a0\n* For some of the scenes, I split them up into moments. I just went with the flow of the scene and if he stops for a moment or the scene cuts to someone else - I split up the running moment into parts.\u00a0\n* If you\u2019re interested in learning more about the top 10 and this list, I recorded a podcast episode about the  data collection and ranking process. It\u2019s fun. You should listen to it. The podcast is called [*Movies, Films and Flix*](https://www.spreaker.com/episode/bonus-episode-the-tom-cruise-running-special--65723787) \\- you can find it wherever you listen to podcasts. I also have a show called *Deep Blue Sea - The Podcast* that you should listen to as well.\n\n\n\n**Here\u2019s the list!**\n\n295.

Mission: Impossible 2 - Runs in slow motion (through some doves) and lands a sweet kick. - Fun Woo stuff.\n\n35. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning - Venice running to get to Ilsa.\n\n34.

The Firm - Chases after Abbey - This is the first time we ever get to see Tom\u2019s super running form.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\n**Top 25!**\n\n\n\n25. *Collateral* \\- Subway running followed by a beautiful jump - Dude is pissed. - 01:46:10\n\n24. *The Mummy* \\- \u201cSlip in, slip out. Just like we always do.\u201d Then it cuts to them being shot at whilst running away. - 00:10:15\n\n23. *Mission: Impossible - Fallout* \\- Keep going straight? - He runs into an office building and smashes a window. 01:34:53\n\n22. *Mission: Impossible - Fallout* \\- Why is he running in a circle? Great overhead shot of cruise sprinting up stairs, losing the goons, and running around the upper floors of the cathedral. - 01:32:59\n\n21. *Mission: Impossible - Fallout* \\- Roof running and two amazing jumps. - 01:33:48\n\n20. *Mission: Impossible - Fallout* \\- During the bathroom fight Hunt runs at a guy and slams him through a wall. Great stuff. I love how he really doesn\u2019t want to do it. - 00:32:38\n\n19. *Minority Repor*t - Runs up to the house and has to stop a potential murder. - 00:15:28:00\n\n18. *Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol* \\- Runs away from the Burj Khalifa - Looks awesome. Brad Bird shoots it from every angle. I love how the camera looks up at him.\n\n17. *Mission: Impossible - Fallout* \\- \u201cEthan he\u2019s getting away from you, you\u2019re going to have to go faster! - Cruise absolutely books it during a roof run that ends with the jump that broke his foot. Epic. - 01:34:20\n\n16. *Jerry Maguire* \\- Airport running. - 02:06:05\n\n15. *Mission: Impossible II* \\- He runs in slow motion so he can jump out of a building - Wonderful - 01:25:58 - He also runs while holding two guns (and shooting them at the same time). Awesome hair work\n\n14. *Risky Business* \\- He takes a drunk guy out of a train and runs back into it. - 01:20:45\u00a0\n\n13. *Days of Thunder* \\- He races Robert Duvall - It\u2019s a good time. 01:42:54\n\n12. *War of the Worlds* \\- Cruise runs away from the aliens. Amazing scene. - The aliens are silly for thinking they can blow Cruise up. Dude has ash all over his face. - 00:26:29\n\n11. *Collateral* \\- Runs out of a hospital and across an overpass. When he starts running I don\u2019t think he'll ever look faster on screen. - 00:52:25\n\n  \n\n\n**10.** ***Edge of Tomorrow*** \\- \u201cArrest this man.\u201d - In an all-timer Cruise moment, he tries to escape arrest and It ends badly - 00:07:58 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/EO4Mt9DDV-Q)\u00a0\n\nMoments before Brendan Gleeson\u2019s character yells \u201cArrest this man,\u201d Tom Cruise delivers an all-timer Cruise moment in which this dialogue is delivered:\n\n\u201cI just inspired millions of people to join your army. And when the body bags come home and they\u2019re looking for someone to blame, how hard do you think it would be for me to convince people to blame you? I\u2019d imagine the general would prefer to avoid that.\u201d\n\nCruise enters Gleeson\u2019s office with total confidence and he quickly becomes a slimy rat whose escape attempt ends quickly. It\u2019s perfect and it makes his heroic transformation more interesting. Director Doug Liman did a great job weaponizing Cruise\u2019s charm in this scene, and It\u2019s fun watching a guy who can\u2019t escape an office building becoming a world-saving soldier.\n\n\n\n**9.** ***The Firm*** \\- The final chase scene. He runs, jumps, goes up steps and this is when we get to see his true breakaway speed AND he\u2019s holding a briefcase. 02:12:23 - [YouTube Clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0vCzkK_AJ0&amp;pp=ygUUVGhlIGZpcm0gY2hhc2Ugc2NlbmU%3D)\u00a0\n\n*The Firm* is Cruise\u2019s first film to fully showcase his soon-to-be-famous running form (elbows and knees). We get a glimpse of it at the 68-minute mark when he\u2019s chasing down Jeannie Tripplehorn. But, it\u2019s not until the climactic chase that we see his breakaway speed for several minutes as he\u2019s running away from Tobin \u201cJigsaw\u201d Bell.\u00a0\n\n\n\n**8.** ***Far and Away*** \\- In a neat transition,\u00a0 Cruise starts running so fast that the next shot is of an explosion. Talk about explosive running.\u00a0 01:40:13 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/NajSnF9AspA)\u00a0\n\nI love how Ron Howard cuts from a sprinting Tom Cruise to an explosion. It\u2019s silly and it always puts a smile on my face. I also love that the movie ends with the Land Run of 1893.\u00a0\n\n\n\n**7.** ***Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation*** \\- Cruise wipes out while trying to jump over a car. It is very funny and the MI score helps make it better - 01:12:58 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/WK8X6m_wEbg)\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis is *Mission: Impossible*, I can\u2019t just cross a street and get in a car.\u201d - McQuarrie talking about a conversation he had with Cruise on the *Rogue Nation* commentary.\u00a0\n\nWhen putting together the top 10 I always knew that this three-second moment would be included. It\u2019s a silly moment punctuated by cheeky musical accompaniment and it proves that Cruise doesn\u2019t take himself seriously. It\u2019s made even better by the knowledge that Cruise came up with this bit on the day and he surprised the crew with his ill-fated car jump. Also, the ensuing dialogue (What are you talking about?) is delightful. At this point in his career, Cruise was on a hot streak and it\u2019s fun knowing that he was still totally down to make himself look like a dork.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n**6.** ***Mission: Impossible - Fallout*** \\- Iconic run across the building punctuated by a beautiful tracking shot - Dude looks amazing and he almost catches Cavill - 01:36:25 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/Sjn3ELLcy2U)\n\n\u201cI loved doing this, but it hurt.\u201d - Tom Cruise - *Fallout* Blu-ray commentary.\u00a0\n\nWatching Cruise run across The Blackfriars Railway bridge is an all-timer Cruise moment for multiple reasons.\u00a0\n\n* It looks great and is a perfect trailer moment\n* \u201cI\u2019m jumping out of a window.\u201d - Great line - I love the reaction he gets from the people in the office. They\u00a0\n* Tom was still recovering from the ankle break he suffered during a jump gone awry\n* Director Christopher McQuarrie said - \u201cHe was going for it.\u201d\n* The score rules\n* It\u2019s a bit gratuitous but the running makes sense in regards to the story.\n\n\n\n**5**. ***Mission: Impossible*** \\- Cruise runs from an exploding restaurant and does his first \u201cI look awesome while running in an action film\u201d work. - 31:59 - Lots of fish die\u2026.. [YouTube Clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8HHeT4Eo6A&amp;pp=ygUiTWlzc2lvbiBpbXBvc3NpYmxlIGZpc2ggcmVzdGF1cmFudNIHCQl-CQGHKiGM7w%3D%3D)\n\nThat one was particularly very crazy - Talking about the scene on The Graham Norton Show\n\nTom Cruise was already a big star in 1996, but this moment made him a gigantic \u201caction movie\u201d star. He had been in *Top Gun* (sitting in a plane), *Legend* (lots of rolling and crouch running), Days of Thunder (*more sitting*), Far and Away (*boxing*), and *The Outsiders* (fisticuffs), but *Mission: Impossible* saw him entering a new phase of his career. This moment was everywhere in 1996 and it\u2019s one of the most iconic images of the *Mission: Impossible* franchise. It gets added points because the stunt looks legitimately dangerous and features some solid arm work from Tom.\u00a0\n\n\n\n**4.** ***Risky Business*** \\- A cigarette-smoking Cruise (wearing sunglasses at night) runs up to some teenagers while the song \u201cMannish Boy\u201d plays on the soundtrack This is the moment when Cruise became Tom Cruise - 01:07:26 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/adZvM19Qnb0) (starts at 53 seconds)\n\nWearing a suit coat, black shirt, black sunglasses and puffing on a cigarette, Cruise is strutting down the street and runs up to a group of classmates. The moment lasts only seven seconds,\u00a0 but it\u2019s a turning point for Cruise. Also, the song selection is perfect.\u00a0\n\n\n\n**3.** ***Vanilla Sky*** \\- Cruise runs through an empty Times Square - 00:03:37 - [YouTube Clip](https://youtu.be/-kNdNC-2wPU)\n\nThe groundwork for the Times Square running in *Vanilla Sky* was set up in the 1996 film *Jerry Maguire*. In the Cameron Crowe-directed movie, Cruise dramatically runs through an airport -\u00a0 and it looks great. Years later, while filming *Vanilla Sky*, Crowe and Cruise pulled some strings with the city of New York and were able to close down Times Square for three hours on a Sunday morning in November. The idea was that Cruise\u2019s character hates being alone, and he dreams that he\u2019s alone in one of the busiest places in the world. It\u2019s total vanity, but I love that Cruise has a running scene in an empty Times Square.\u00a0\n\n\n\n**2.** ***Collateral*** \\- He throws a chair through a glass window, then WIPES out on the chair and just keeps running. It\u2019s his most aggressive running ever. - 01:44:50 -[ YouTube Clip (starts at 2:37)](https://youtu.be/_pTzb4rl5Y8)\n\n*Collatera*l not only features the best sitting performance of Tom Cruise\u2019s career, it also features his most aggressive running. Tom\u2019s character Vincent is a straight-up killer and it\u2019s fun watching Cruise as he fully commits to being a coyote who chases down his prey with lightning-fast footwork. There\u2019s a moment towards the end when Vincent is chasing down Max and Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith - running in heels), and he takes a chair to smash a window so he can run through it. However, Cruise mistimed/misjudged the chair\u2019s trajectory and he WIPED out on the chair and fell to the ground. The neat thing is that he springs up immediately and keeps running. It\u2019s a perfect showcase for Cruise\u2019s tenacity and toughness and I love that the unplanned moment made its way into the film - and so does Mann who felt like it added to the realism of *Collateral*. It\u2019s a seconds-long moment, but I love that nothing can stop Cruise from running.\u00a0\n\n\n\n**1.** ***Mission: Impossible III*** \\- Cruise runs across some rooftops and then he SPRINTS through a Shanghai fishing village - 01:44:10 - [YouTube Clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOqV-jDl0h8&amp;pp=ygUhbWlzc2lvbiBpbXBvc3NpYmxlIDMgc2hhbmdoYWkgcnVu0gcJCX4JAYcqIYzv)\n\nIn 2006, Cruise had been running in movies for 20+ years and had some memorable sprints in *War of the Worlds, The Firm, Minority Report, Collatera*l, and *Far and Away*. However, his sprinting in *M:I 3* (which took 6-7 takes to get perfect) made people sit up and realize they were witnessing cinematic running history. It\u2019s the fastest Cruise has ever looked, and the spidercam rig that was built for the scene works perfectly as it tracks alongside Cruise as he damn near goes plaid on the Shanghai sidewalks. During the Blu-ray commentary, director J.J. Abrams says \u201cI loved watching you run\u201d to Cruise, and I totally agree. It\u2019s apex Tom Cruise running.\n\n  \n**Make sure to check out my other** [**Reddit data posts**](https://www.reddit.com/user/LundgrensFrontKick/) **if you like this one!

Then with the robot and that slow realization that 9000 series computer is a fucking killer to his slow mercy pleading death. No jumpscares or anything, just empty shots and crazy good cinema. Didn\u2019t think it was possible to convey such fear, eeriness, nothingness in such shots. Incredible and creepy. Then it just started getting even worse. Hallucination like extraterrestrial shots with colors and sound that make you feel like you\u2019ve gone insane. The occasional look of horror from the crew member as he is experiencing this is also DEEPLY unsettling. Then finally, the room. Was expecting a jumpscare but nothing. Just weird play with time and age. Extremely unsettling. \n\nWas expecting something like Interstellar. Mind bending storyline that makes you go \u201cwow the universe is a crazy place.\u201d Odessey makes you go \u201cWow the universe is scary, empty, nothing. torture. Evil. Cinical. Relative. Unending. Lonely.\u201d\n\ncrazy shit man crazy shit\u2026",

        "content": "I.. cannot believe this turned out bad, but somehow, the feat was managed. I've been looking forward to this for three or four years now, ever since it was first announced, so I'm really feeling the sting on this disappointment.\n\nAs for what's wrong with it, uh... basically everything. Literally the entire thing, from stem to stern; the plot feels completely perfunctory, the characters are thinner than wafer, and it has a surprisingly light amount of action in it.. To make matters worse, nearly every single frame of that action is tainted by an ocean of CGI blood, CGI glass, shoddy lighting and jittery camera-work. Oh, and a few dashes of excessive slow-mo to tie it all together.\n\nIt's bad by even standard action-flick standards, but especially considering the level of talent involved (the director of The Raid movies, famous machismo machines Tom Hardy and Timothy Olyphant) it's absolutely wild how lifeless and unoriginal this feels.\n\nI've heard several people mention that a lot of straight-to-streaming films these days feel like fake movies, because of the made-by-committee look and overall sense of laziness involved in the worst of the bunch, and this really comes off like kin to that particular strain of movie... during it's 97 minute sprint from start to finish, it just feels so... unmemorable, and that was the last vibe that I would've expected to get from something that only had to check a few easy boxes (look cool, blast some crooks, and give Tom Hardy a few interesting lines) to register as a success.\n\nWhat a bummer, dude.\n\n(And as always, if you liked it, that's totally cool. I have no desire to yuck anyone's yum; I just wanna offer my feelings on it.)",

        "content": "I don't have the knowledge for a real review but, to me, **this film is a truly jewel**\n\nIronically, in my country, Rambo may be used as meme. It's a joking for those person who throw themself headlong into a problem, thinking he can solve all by themself\n\nWhat Rambo represents, however, is the exact opposite: he is a symbol of **humanity fragility**\n\nProbably Rambo is not a committed movie... but how many other action movies deal with such important themes?\n\nThe amazing thing is how these themes are not exploited for political propaganda by those who, perhaps, are sharply aligned; they are told for what they are in themselves and the impact they have on people, how we are all victims\n\nBecause, let's be honest, whatever your opinion of Vietnam War, the pain, the loneliness... the contradictions suffered by veterans were tremendous. And it's something that can flood into broader contexts, precious to show the damage of war... **not just during, even after**\n\nThen we have even more: how health is not only physical, but also mental. Denunciation of police abuses. The weak picking on the even weaker. Hatred of the unknown in favor of maintaining an illusory status quo\n\nOne of the very few action films that does not overdo with... exaggerations. A film that, within limits, tries to keep itself realistic, plausible. The action is there, but it's secondary to the telling of the story, of the protagonist and his message we talked about above\n\nYou're not watching explosions, jumps, missiles, fast vehicles... you're watching the vicissitudes of a **man**; you're feeling his emotions. You can empathise\n\nLast but not least, I try to delve a little bit into the more technical part. The **shots, the cinematography**... I love them. They manage to make you feel the vibes of those places; the cloudy, muggy Northwest, the thick coniferous forests, mountains, the smell of rain and wet earth\n\nFor me, a hiking lover, it's simply something magical. It feels like being there, walking through the trees, vibing and living a new adventure\n\nAnd finally, this time for real, how an ending is important to hold this boring wall of text together... there is one thing that holds all these points of the film together: the **music**. There is little to say, except that takes me back in time. Sweet nostalgia. Thanks, Rambo\n\nThanks to you all for reading",

The film should stand out in some distinct way from the rest of their work, which makes the question even more interesting and more difficult when applied to someone with a long and varied career.\n\nSome examples might include Arnold Schwarzenegger in Junior, Francis Ford Coppola's Jack, Kevin Smith's Red State, or Judi Dench in The Chronicles of Riddick.",
