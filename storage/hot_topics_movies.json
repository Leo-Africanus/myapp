DeNiro and a young DiCaprio on the same film antagonizing each other in phenomenal performances in a incredible story. \n\nThe movie is the real story of writer Tobias Wolff during his teenage years when his mother was married to his abusive stepfather. Based on the synopsis I thought that would be a great moment of revelation when we find Dwight (played by DeNiro) is abusive but it starts simple, we see a positive side of the character consistently while we still realize how awful he is. It's also the most realistic portrayal I've seem of bullying from an authority figure. When I finished the movie, I knew there would still be some people who think Dwight was a good guy who was just parenting simply because the movie doesn't exaggerate his abuse.\n\nI'm amazed by the fact I never heard of this film considering the big names attached to it.",

        "content": "In celebration of thirty years from their release dates, I was curious about which of these two movies people think is better. Both movies came out in 1995. Both involve a son trying to take over their father\u2019s company. Both starred SNL alum who were fired that year. Which was the better movie when it came out? Which has held up better?\n\nEdit: Fun fact - Tommy Boy was originally called Billy the Third but was changed when they found out Sandler had a movie coming out named Billy Madison. ",

        "content": "I\u2019m currently watching all the best picture winners in chronological order, at about the end of the 1940s right now (Hamlet is next up). And while it is cool to see the year by year winners, it is also pretty easy to get burned out. As I\u2019m not only watching them but reviewing and rating every single one as well. Plus the B&amp;W and outdated filmmaking over and over isn\u2019t necessarily ideal for a marathon, not for me at least. So throwing a \u201cfun\u201d movie in there between every few films helps with the burn out. \n\nThe only one I\u2019ve watched so far has been Game Night (2018) and that one fits what I\u2019m looking for perfectly. A fun, interesting, but not too serious movie. What other ones are there?",
