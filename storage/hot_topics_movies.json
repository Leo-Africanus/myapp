The weird thing is I have a VIVID memory of a particular shot from when I first saw it that I did not see when I just watched it on streaming (spoiler tag for spoilers and gore):\n\n&gt;!I swear to god in the original theater release there was a shocking and very gory shot of a picture of Treadwell's head as the bear left it, with the bit of spine still attached as the airplane pilot describes. The shot only lasts for a second or two and kinda comes out of nowhere, the head is sitting upright on the neck and not laying on its side.!&lt;\n\nI spent the whole rewatch bracing myself for this shot and then was really confused when the movie ended without it. Am I making this up? Was it edited out after the initial release?? Someone please help restore my sanity! ",

        "content": "I mean is this guy crazy or what? I really enjoyed it as a deep dive into American suburbia hell but it was one of the weirdest experiences of my life. I laughed at times where i felt i should be not laughing\u2026 it was funny but in a depressing and sad way. Truly one of the ballsiest scripts of all time. PSH is one of the best actors of all time and he is great in this but Dylan Baker just outshines everyone including PSH in this. What a performance, i mean, it is genuinely one of the most undervalued performances of all time. This was my first Todd Solondz movie and it took me by surprise. What do you guys think about it? If you have seen it.",

        "title": "Erin Brokovich is a great movie, but Erin herself is kind of awful",
        "content": "I\u2019m not commenting on the \\*real\\* Erin Brokovich, but on the character in the film.\n\nObviously, the character cares deeply about the evils being perpetrated by PG&amp;E and she wants justice for those affected. That\u2019s an admirable trait and it makes her easy to root for, because of course we want her to succeed and we want this major corporation to be held accountable.\n\nBut throughout the entire movie, Erin is awful to just about everyone else in her life except the plaintiffs.\n\n\u2022 She shows no appreciation toward the lady next door who had apparently been taking care of her kids for free.\n\n\u2022 She blames Ed Masry for losing her car accident case despite the fact that she\u2019s the one who blew up in court, and then she basically guilts/bullies him into giving her a job. Even after he does so (which he\u2019s under no obligation to do) and even gives her an advance on her paycheck on what seems like her first day, she continues to insult, disrespect, and degrade him throughout the entire film.\n\n\u2022 She\u2019s awful to all of her coworkers. Granted, some of them are very mean to her as well, but frankly I don\u2019t blame them. She makes fun of their weight, yells at them, and calls them bitches to their faces.\n\n\u2022 She\u2019s awful to George, who she basically treats as a free live-in nanny. When he confronts her about the way she treats him, she doesn\u2019t apologize or even acknowledge that she\u2019s done anything wrong. She also seemingly doesn\u2019t give a second thought to how her kids feel, since they spend most of their time with George at that point and would obviously be devastated by him leaving.\n\n\u2022 She\u2019s awful to the other legal team that Masry brings in to assist with the case, despite the fact that they\u2019re just doing their jobs and even bankrolled the whole thing. Theresa is definitely condescending toward her, but it\u2019s not in an intentional way. Erin never shows them even the slightest modicum of respect and acts from the beginning like they\u2019re incompetent and don\u2019t care about the plaintiffs.\n\nDoes this aspect of the movie bother anyone else? I kind of expected there to be a scene at some point where Erin apologized to\u2026 well, anyone. But in the film, she\u2019s always treated like she\u2019s in the right and like her behavior toward everyone is justified because of how much she cares about the case. I find this to be a really off-putting element in an otherwise great film.",
