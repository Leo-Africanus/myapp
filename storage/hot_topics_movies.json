We're Steve Hudson (director/writer) and Guy Bass (author of the bestselling children's book) of STITCH HEAD, an animated feature about a forgotten creature living in a long-abandoned castle.

Terrified the suspicious townsfolk of the village below will form an Angry Mob and burn the Professor's Castle to the ground, Stitch Head desperately indoctrinates his fellow creations to NOT be monstrous.

I'm an award-winning author whose children's books series include Stitch Head, SCRAP, Skeleton Keys, Spynosaur and lots of books that don't begin with 'S' like Dinkin Dings, Anna Gain, Laura Norder and Noah Scape. In 2010 Dinkin Dings and the Frightening Things won the Blue Peter Award for Most Fun Book with Pictures.\n\nI have also written plays for both adults and children. I've previously been a theatre producer, illustrator, temp, gerbil whisperer and have acted my way out of several paper bags. I spent my childhood reading comics and hoping one day to become a superhero. I spend my adulthood in more or less the same way. I live in London with my wife and imaginary friends.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------\n\nAsk us anything! We'll be back at 3 PM ET today (Tuesday 11/4) to answer your questions",

        "content": "So I just recently watched The Long Walk. And among many other things one thing I really appreciated about the movie was how average everyone looked.\nOutside of McVries and Stebbins most characters were super jacked or ripped with 6% Body fat. They were just average looking guys.\n\nAnd this raised a question in my mind. When exactly did it become a norm for leading men to be super jacked or ripped in films.\n\nI remember watching older films where the Leading Men were just average looking guys. Even in movies that had action in them.\n\nSean Connery's Bond had a fairly average build. Gene Hackman's Detective character in The French Connection looked like an average Middle Aged Guy.\nHarrison Ford's Deckard had an average man build too.\n\nBut today. If you see a horror movie the main Male character is going to be ripped.\n\nYou see a Sci Fi film the main Male character is going to be ripped.\n\nYou make a Detective movie, the main 40 year old Family man detective is going to be ripped as fuck.\n\nIf it's a teen he's going to be ripped. \n\nIf it's a doctor he's going to be ripped. \n\nIf it's a lawyer he's going to be ripped.\n\nSo when did this become a norm and why?\n\nI initially thought it might have started with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester stallone who brought the jacked look to the American Hero.\n\nBut even in the era of of Schwarzenegger and Stallone you had average guy Action heroes like Bruce Willis in Die Hard, Michael Beihn in Terminator and Ford in Witness and The Fugitive.\nLet alone in non action leading roles.\n\nSo I really am confounded as to when this trend properly started where any lead character regardless of the genre or role has to be ripped.

Tragically gone before his time, there is no denying PSH was trying way harder than the material needed in this movie. \u201cRAIN DANCE\u201d will never escape my vernacular and I am totally fine with that",

The inevitable steering towards a more franchise-heavy focus is all but worrisome.\n\n[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/04/predator-badlands-review-elle-fanning) \\- 2 / 5\n\n&gt;The sheer pointlessness of everything that happens subtracts the oxygen and even Fanning\u2019s imperishable star quality can\u2019t save it.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - Richard Lawson](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/predator-badlands-review-elle-fanning-dan-trachtenberg-1236417477/)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s a perspective shift that mostly works, so thoughtful is the film\u2019s construction. Trachtenberg is generous but also careful with detail; his film remembers what it has previously introduced us to, satisfyingly referencing back to plants and animals passingly encountered an hour prior. *Badlands* is a decidedly B-movie that thoroughly utilizes and enjoys the freedoms allowed when any prestige ambition is eschewed. The film simply wants to be the best version of a zillionth *Predator* installment that it can be. If it has to complicate \u2014 and, yes, soften \u2014 the branding to do that, so be it.\u00a0\n\n[David Ehrlich - IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/predator-badlands-movie-review-1235158691/) \\- 'B+'\n\n&gt;The least \u201cPredator\u201d-like moments in this standalone sequel are rooted in Trachtenberg\u2019s love for the property, and all help \u201cBadlands\u201d to make a uniquely compelling argument that \u201cPredator\u201d deserves to be higher on the Hollywood food chain than anyone thought to place it over the last 40 years. By reckoning with the series\u2019 fundamental weakness rather than continuing to pretend that it\u2019s the series\u2019 greatest strength, Trachtenberg has made the brand richer than ever before. No, this isn\u2019t your daddy\u2019s \u201cPredator,\u201d and it *definitely* isn\u2019t *Dek\u2019s* daddy\u2019s \u201cPredator,\u201d but as a wise synthetic once said, \u201cWe can be more than what they ask of us.\u201d How rare \u2014 and extremely refreshing \u2014\u00a0to see a big studio movie recognize that the same can be true of itself.\u00a0\n\n[IGN - Clint Gage](https://www.ign.com/articles/predator-badlands-review) \\- 8 / 10\n\n&gt;Dan Trachtenberg is heading in an interesting direction with this franchise and he gets bonus points for that. The Predator as a mysterious murder monster is getting some of his backstory filled in, and that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. Badlands, in shifting the perspective to a Yautja main character, actually highlights what\u2019s been great about this franchise in its better moments. Dek and Thia are an unexpectedly fun pairing that bring a new energy to the franchise and an altogether different kind of hunt. It might not be pulling the skull and spine out of us and screaming in bloody victory, but it gets close.\n\n[DEADLINE - Damon Wise](https://deadline.com/2025/11/predator-badlands-review-elle-fanning-dimitrius-schuster-koloamatangi-1236606321/)\n\n&gt;Returning director Dan Trachtenberg is clearly in a groove here, and his enthusiasm helps, notably in the film\u2019s impeccable world-building. But the action scenes never seem to galvanize, and somewhere along the line the predator, once a ruthless, unstoppable killing machine, has simply lost its menacing mojo. It all seems a bit, well, *silly* \u2014 like a long episode of *Succession* starring John Travolta\u2019s character in *Battlefield Earth*, or the adventures of Eric Trump in space \u2014 and that surely can\u2019t bode well for the inevitable next instalment.\n\n[Slash Film - Jeremy Mathai](https://www.slashfilm.com/2016872/predator-badlands-movie-review/) \\- 8 / 10\n\n&gt;If there are any negatives to point out, they're mostly a byproduct of blockbuster issues as a whole. The brisk pacing that keeps things moving at a breezy clip also means any semblance of character depth and nuance is either left as subtext or outright explained in exposition, though Trachtenberg still manages to find quiet grace notes for both Dek and Thia (and perhaps others too spoilery to give away here) amid all the carnage. And even as the action rivals anything in the franchise, the much larger sense of scale might have some yearning for the contained, stripped-down joys of \"Prey.\" All of those nitpicks pale in comparison to what the filmmakers accomplish here, however. By far the funniest, most heartfelt, and boldest \"Predator\" movie of them all, \"Badlands\" etches its place in franchise history \u2014 right alongside the classic that started it all and the three worthy follow-ups that\u00a0Trachtenberg has delivered so far. Let's hope there are many more to come.\n\n",

        "content": "I started noticing a couple of years ago what looked like a grid of black dots displayed over movies in some movie theaters. It ranges from \\*very\\* visible and distracting to only slightly so. The issue is that these are 'micro-perf' screens: screens with tiny holes built into them to allow a sound from a speaker placed behind the screen to carry through. In theory, these holes are supposed to be so tiny that they're impossible to see. Unfortunately, that is not the case at a bunch of movie theaters, at least in NYC.\n\nIt looks something like this: [https://share.google/images/3lf5WK8fQr9iQsA4z](https://share.google/images/3lf5WK8fQr9iQsA4z)\n\nHas anyone else been noticing this? I'm kind of shocked at how distracting it is and at the fact that I haven't found it being discussed anywhere.\n\nThe places I've most noticed it (in NYC) are Film Forum, Nitehawk, and Angelika East (downstairs, not the big screen). These are all small/indie movie theaters, so I guess it wouldn't surprise me if it isn't a problem at big multiplexes.\n\nEDIT: A bunch of people are pointing out that this tech is very old and standard. So I was wrong to imply that the issue is micro-perf'd screens in general! Still, something about how this tech is being used recently, at least in some indie chains in NYC, is having some very bad results.",

        "content": "So tonight I watched \"Heat\" for the first time (I know, I know) as I'm on a bit of a Michael Mann kick. As usual as soon as I finished it I headed over to the IMDB trivia section.\n\nThe trivia contains several references to John Rhys-Davies, who is...not in the film. Although some comments reference that he may have originally been cast to play the role that John Voight went on to play? I haven't found other sources for this being the case. (I'm aware that IMDB trivia isn't ironclad as anyone can add it, this is just a funny example of it)\n\nBut like...read these.\n\n&gt;John Rhys Davies pushed director Michael Mann to make the Neil McCauley and Vincent Hanna characters \"little people\" using forced perspective camera techniques, but this was shot down as being too costly. He would later revisit this concept with Peter Jackson on Lord of the Rings.\n\nLike...what? He wanted them to look...little? And AFAIK the forced perspective concept used in LOTR was not the idea of John Rhys-Davies.\n\nAnd then:\n\n&gt;Michael Mann and actor John Rhys Davies have not spoken in 30 years but occasionally share funny YouTube videos through an intermediary.\n\nUm...ok. How would anyone know this, if this were in fact true.\n\nAnd then:\n\n&gt;The character of Nate was originally cast with John Rhys Davies, but during shooting Davies kept referring to DeNiro's Neil McCauley as \"Indy\". Despite attempts to work around this, the character was eventually recast with Jones Voight.\n\nWHAT.\n\nAnd finally:\n\n&gt;John Rhys Davies and director Michael Mann frequently clashed over the use of the word \"kadam\" rather than the conventional imperial foot as a unit of measurement in the script. And also whether the Nate character would have a pet monkey.\n\nOkay. Someone's definitely trolling...in the Trivia section of the movie \"Heat\" on IMDB. That is some specific-ass internet trolling.",

        "content": "I even enjoyed Matthew Broderick's bumbling Phillippe Gaston with the American accent because Broderick always had that appealing boy next door aura that made him easy to root in everything he's in. We know his character doesn't stand a chance with the otherworldy Isabeau, enchantingly played by Michelle Pfeiffer, but I don't know, I think every dorky kid saw themselves in Phillipe as he and Isabeau playfully flirted. \n\nI love this movie to bits. The concept of two soulmates separated by a curse which prevented them to see each other as humans is quite lovey-dovey in the right way and while Rutger Hauer mostly played complex bad guys, I think that actually enhanced his turn as Navarre, who's a heroic while still tough and almost unapproachable figure. He can be stern and rough because he's unhappy that his loyal hawk is actually the love of his life, a woman cursed to live as a hawk during the day, but when he warms up to Phillippe and he gives us a monologue, Hauer shines and reminds us of the brilliance of his big scene in Blade Runner. Such an incredibly underrated actor. \n\nThe movie didn't do well in the 80s, cuz people have no taste, and I don't get the constant bitching about the Alan Parsons Project score. I actually like the use of the synthethizers mixed with that romantic, conventional melody. It's unique and fantastic. \n\nI wish more people knew about it.",
