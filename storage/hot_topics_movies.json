        "content": "So, there is this 1991 romcom \"Defending your Life\" starring Meryl Streep and Albert Brooks, whose premise is two people meeting each other in some sort of purgatory after dying and falling in love.\n\nAnd i gotta tell you, this movie is neat af. Interesting concept of the afterlife and solid world building and it also has a bit of suspense, considering that they don't know what will happen to them because they are in purgatory.\n\nWell, this movie has obviously met the typical 1990s romcom fate and disappeared into oblivion, but for me personally, since i watched  \"Defending your Life\" in the early 2000s, to quote Citizen Kane's Mr. Bernstein, not a month has gone by, that i haven't thought about that movie.\n\n\nDo you have a movie that isn't very popular or maybe considered a generic mass product in the general popculture conscious, that stuck with you?",

        "title": "Why did no one tell me Crank (2006) was such a crazy balls to wall movie? Jason Statham's greatest performance. Seriously under-hyped action-comedy.",
        "content": "Obviously, the title is slightly tongue in cheek, and Crank is a popular, well-known movie. I think it deserves to be seen as an action comedy classic and an archetype of how to make a great fast paced 90 min movie, however. The budget seems fairly mid-range with the various action sequences.\n\nThe movie is so frenetic from the very start.  Jason Statham is just goddamn marvelous in it. His greatest performance I have ever seen. \n\nI'd always thought Statham's best performance was in Snatch. That may be the best movie he's starred in - but Crank has to be the best performance for me. It seems like he's up for anything. It's a satirical self-deprecating Statham performance, like in Spy with Melissa McCarthy. Just really fun.\n\nThis movie starts with the foot on the accelerator and doesn't stop, getting more and more crazy as Chev (Statham) fights against the poison in his body - he has to keep his heart rate high to stop it from killing him. \n\nThe action is fun and the movie is very funny. It sort of feels like I am watching a movie version of GTA at times as Chev is just like one of their protagonists and causes utter carnage - I honestly think it must have been inspired by those games (with Sanandreas out a couple years prior). Statham bears a striking resemblance to the look and feel of characters from the later GTA games - so it may have worked both ways.\n\nAmy Smart is so utterly sexy as the girlfriend Eve. A scene stealing role. There's some funny scenes and hijinks where she's getting on with her normal life, lolling about in bed high, trying to fix the microwave clock, while all this crazy pandemonium is kicking off all around her. I love how this film doesn't take itself seriously but is also extremely unrelenting.\n \nThere's one uncomfortable scene with Chev and Eve which shows the film's age. &gt;!The public sex scene!&lt;. This scene kind of has a &gt;!rapey!&lt; moment that will have you squirming but then it relents and makes up for it with a very funny crazy sequence.\n\nI feel like this film doesn't get the recognition it deserves. I never knew it was so damn good and I'm a huge film fan. I always got the impression it was just a run of the mill noughties action movie.\n\nEdit: &gt;!Just got to the part where Chev and the bad guy fall out the helicopter and through the sky, and continue to argue and fight eachother. Then, after winning, Chev proceeds to make a phonecall while peacefully falling to his death. Again, so so funny.!&lt;",

It's still making me cry 18 years later, so mission accomplished. Extra credit, as a matter of fact. \n\nThere's not much Bridge To Terabithia and Uncut Gems have in common, but they both make me question my willpower prior to watching them. And I'm never adequately prepared for either of them.",

With no prior knowledge\u2014no trailers, no synopsis, not even having heard the titles before\u2014I randomly picked a movie playing at the cinema just to pass the time. Both times, I walked in completely blind and ended up having an absolute blast!\n\n*Law Abiding Citizen*\n\n*John Wick*\n\n\n\nAnother time, a friend recommended *The Man from Earth*. I knew nothing about it going in, but the storytelling was so gripping that it became one of my most memorable movie experiences.\n\nHave you ever gone into a movie knowing absolutely nothing and walked out amazed?

New York City or Los Angeles are best bets.\n\nThe scene: \u00a0&gt;!A tall, muscular man is walking alone at night. A pretty, young woman with curly, red-hair and a sparkling green dress walks up to him and asks \"Want a date?\" The next scene, the very next scene is the guy wiping his sweaty brow with her bloodied dress. It's heavily implied that he killed her off screen.!&lt;\n\nI'm assuming this is the introductory scene to the villain of the movie.",

I want someone to recommend me an underrated comedy movie because it will probably be new to me, as long as it isn't in a \"can you recommend me a underrated comedy movie\" article or reddit post, I've probably never seen it before.  \n  \nI'm feeling down right now because my pet kitten (his name was link) recently died in a preventable death due to hypothermia, he was my first ever pet too. I've honestly been skipping school a bit so watching movies will be a nice way to pass time. \n\nI'll probably reply to the comments and just rate the movies you guys suggested me if anyone is even interested in that. Anyways thank you to anyone who reads this and gives me an recommendation, literally means the world to me right now.",
