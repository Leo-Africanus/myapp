        "content": "This might be obvious to some people, but I haven\u2019t really seen it framed this way before.\n\nLots of analyses say Phil breaks out of the loop when he becomes selfless / grows morally. I buy that. But I realized the Groundhog Day myth itself lines up almost too perfectly:\n\nThe groundhog \u201cseeing its shadow\u201d is literally seeing itself \u2014 and when that happens, winter continues. Spring only comes when it doesn\u2019t see itself.\n\nThat feels like exactly Phil\u2019s problem. As long as he only sees Phil \u2014 his ego, his desires, his boredom, even his despair \u2014 the loop keeps going. Time only moves forward when he stops being self-referential and actually looks outward.\n\nSo, it\u2019s not just \u201cbe nice and you\u2019re free,\u201d but \u201cstop seeing yourself as the center of meaning.\u201d The holiday myth ends up mirroring the character arc.\n\nCurious if anyone\u2019s seen this connection made explicitly before, or if I\u2019m just late to the party.",

There\u2019s so much I wasn\u2019t able to appreciate in my first viewings. Every frame is so carefully curated and layered, the attention to detail in this movie is astounding. Every shot is so meticulously crafted, and expertly captured, there isn\u2019t a single shot in this movie that doesn\u2019t look like a painting. The cinematography and directing are absolutely top notch. As far as directing goes, it doesn\u2019t get better than this. George Miller is a master of the craft and such a brilliant artist. He really created such a monumental film. Watching the action sequences I have no idea how he did most of that, especially knowing the vast majority of the action in the film was done with practical effects. I love everything about this movie, every time I watch it I appreciate new things about it. George Miller really caught lightning in a bottle with this. So grateful for this movie.",

I honestly did not expect this.\n\nI remember being so salty back in the day that Casey Affleck won the Oscar over Ryan Gosling for La La Land. La La Land was my favorite movie that year and I was fully in the \u201chow did Gosling lose??\u201d camp. I was shocked then, and I stayed convinced I was right.\n\nTen years later, watching Manchester by the Sea for the first time\u2026 yeah. I was wrong. Completely.\n\nCasey Affleck gives one of the most devastating, restrained, soul-crushing performances I\u2019ve ever seen. No big speeches, no flashy moments, just grief sitting quietly in every look, every pause, every line. It sneaks up on you and refuses to let go.\n\nAnd that scene with Michelle Williams, the one where she asks if they can get lunch sometime absolutely destroyed me. It\u2019s unbearably sad, painfully real, and acted with such raw honesty that it feels almost intrusive to watch. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget it.\n\nThis movie lingers. It sits with you. It hurts in a way that feels earned. I genuinely can\u2019t stop thinking about it.\n\nWhat a film. What a performance. This is one of those movies that stays with you forever.",

        "content": "The MPAA\u2019s most severe rating, while pretty much not as damning as the ESRB\u2019s AO, is still pretty stigmatized. \n\nBut as with every MPAA rating, there are films where really, the rating doesn\u2019t reflect the content all that well.\n\nBasically, NC-17 (or X rated, before 1990) films where there was no need for the stigma. A normal R rating would have sufficed. Or maybe this would have been NC-17 when it came out, but would score an R or even a PG-13 if it was released today.\n\nFilms like that?\n\nWhen I think of films like this, the first one I think of is A Clockwork Orange. It is a bit intense and isn\u2019t non controversial, but even the uncut version is pretty much just a Hard R today.",

The torture is relentless and I\u2019m a pretty seasoned horror fan. I think it being a franchise gives it a few more allowances than new IP, but god damn does that movie not let up. ",

        "content": "I remember I initially wasn\u2019t even going to see it. I wasn\u2019t super against cartoons but at a time where live action marvel was dominating I had no interest in seeing a cartoon Spider-Man film.\n\nHappened to see it on a whim when me and the family were out of town, trying to figure out which movie we wanted to see that weekend. I see ITSV just came out and I\u2019m astonished by the 90%\u2019s and praise it\u2019s getting. I say fuck it, why not?\n\nBest decision ever. The visuals, the humor, the music, I loved everything about this movie. It went from a film I was a little reluctant to see to one of my favorite animated movies of all time. I\u2019ll even go as far as to say it was revolutionary for it\u2019s style. These days you see a lot of animated films taking inspiration from that 2D/3D hybrid style the Spiderverse films were known for.\n\nAlso I can\u2019t lie, hearing Hypnotize by the notorious B.I.G. In the theater almost made me lose my shit.\n\nI may sound like a walking ad for this movie but I don\u2019t care. Anyone else have a similar experience seeing that movie in theaters?",

Maybe forgettable is a better word. A movie that didn't do anything special, but didn't do anything wrong either. Bonus points if it's not a sequel.\n\nSo one that comes to mind is _The Man from U.N.C.L.E_. I didn't think it was a bad movie, but it definitely wasn't good either. The action scenes were okay, the acting was fine. I didn't dislike the film, or regret watching it, but after it was over, I just thought... meh, it was a movie.",

        "content": "So I just went to a screening of the camp classic and I have to admit it was a lot better than I remembered.\n\nYes, the negatives are still there.\n\n* It\u2019s not very well directed, especially the musical numbers, which are extremely static. The final song with Olivia singing in the netherworld is a great track, but the camera literally does a slow zoom for three straight minutes.\n* Michael Beck whiplash. This guy is so good in\u00a0*The Warriors*\u00a0and so wooden here it\u2019s kind of wild. Especially for a movie that is this heightened and fantasy driven, he\u2019s just stiff.\n\nBut all of that gets drowned out by many things...  number one is...\n\n* Olivia Newton John\u2019s magnetism on screen. She\u2019s just so lovely. The opening number I'm alive by ELO hits harder now that she's gone.\n* Plus the wild story actually works in this musical, especially when it moves into full sci fi level insanity.\n* The animated sequence by Don Bluth looks fantastic. Lush and beautiful.\n* And the music. Even with the static directing, it\u2019s an amazing soundtrack. I forgot how much of the movie is music. It\u2019s practically half the runtime.\n* The ELO stuff is a blast and pairs perfectly with Olivia Newton John.\n* The scene with Gene Kelly dancing with his muse Olivia from the forties is genuinely beautiful and moving. The dancing is terrific.\n* The number where all the different musical eras collide in the rundown club is electric. Flatly directed, yes, but the dancers and the music work so well together that it doesn\u2019t matter.\n* And Xanadu at the end. They throw absolutely everything against the wall to see what sticks and somehow it does, thanks entirely to ONJ.\n\nIt was just a blast to watch.\n\nI understand why it got the reputation it did.  \nI understand why it became a cult classic.\n\nHighly recommend it if it ever plays in your city in a theater.\n\nOh and they blasted it so loud, very intentional. My eardrums were vibrating.\n\nLoved it.",

        "content": "I grew up in the 80's and 90's watching all the big action movies. Introducing my sons (8 &amp; 10) to some of my own childhood favorites can be hit or miss. I even find myself groaning at times and feeling like they haven't aged so well. I am aware some parts of action movies are not appropriate for younger viewers, and I do monitor what my kids watch. I also realize I cannot shelter them from everything and try to use questionable content as teaching opportunities, which is much more than adults cared to do for me when I was a child watching these movies. That said, they recently came across JCVD movies and really enjoyed them. They even liked them over more populare movies by more popular action stars. My kids are very observant and we noticed some aspects of his *on screen* persona in contrast with other characters portrayed by other actors. \n\nIn his roles, generally:\n\n- He usually plays an everyman type of character that is relatable to a wider audience.\n\n- He doesn't typically want to fight or go looking for trouble, but fights back to defend himself when attacked, driven by honor, or protecting those less capable. \n\n- He is usually fighting or crusading on behalf of a family member or loved one that he feels morally obliged to stand up for.\n\n- He doesn't immediately resort to using guns or other weapons and more often than not fights hand to hand, rather than killing. \n\n- He prefers a fair fight or being the underdog against a bigger and stronger opponent over dominating others. \n\n- He places a large amount of emphasis on the training, mental focus, and traditional aspects of being a martial artist instead simply an agent of destruction. \n\n- He is respectful and protective toward female characters and doesn't go out of his way to be overtly misogynistic or objectifying.\n\n- He is playful, warm, and caring toward children when he encounters them, often speaking softly at eye level or engaging in fun with them. \n\n- He is rarely boastful or conceited, and shows a righteous indignation toward authority figures he feels have wronged him or held him back from his pursuit of an honorable cause. \n\nThese are some things we discussed about his movies and why my sons have chosen him as their favorite action star of the \"old school\" movies. Is there anything missing here, or are we totally off base? \n",
