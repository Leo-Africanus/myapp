        "content": "My wife is currently watching a TV show and the episode is about a group of people who are kidnapping people and selling them. One of the women who is imprisoned is revealed to be the mastermind of the entire operation at the end of the episode. At one point, other members of the group come and take her away from an actual captive, but they still continue to act like she's a captive as well long after they're away from the person. There is absolutely no reason for them to do this except to continue to dupe the audience into thinking this woman is a captive as well.\n\nSo, this got me thinking about other things like this. Another one I can recall is in a horror movie where the character on screen is facing to the left and the creature pops out from behind him in a jump scare that is SOLELY for the camera. The character would never have seen her or even knew she was there.\n\nWhat are some other examples of this?\n\n  \nEDIT: Yes, it's an episode of Criminal Minds, for those asking.",

        "content": "All I\u2019ve ever heard about this film is bad things since it first came out. People still will tell me it\u2019s terrible and that Routh is a terrible Superman etc. I finally decided to watch it tonight, and disagree. I\u2019m actually upset I never watched it sooner.\n\nIs it perfect? Far from it. But even the Reeve films weren\u2019t perfect. I\u2019ve seen people say it\u2019s all too \u201cconvenient\u201d, but so were the Reeve films? I mean Reeve literally rewound time in the first one to fix everything.\n\nThis film feels like a love letter to the Reeve films and I loved that. Routh gives an honorable and respectful performance as Reeve\u2019s Superman. He plays Superman with this gentleness and warmth I liked. His Superman feels warm. I found him lovely. It\u2019s a shame he got most of the hate when the film came out. Had Reeve lived to see this film made I think he would be proud of Routh\u2019s work. He was honorable and respectful in his portrayal.\n\nKate Bosworth is miscast as Lois Lane, as she is too young and dare i say\u2026 too pretty? Bosworth was only 23 when cast. They definitely needed someone who looked a bit more mature, but she did best with what she was given. Her Lois is a bit whiny though?\n\nKevin Spacey actually looks like he\u2019s having a blast playing Luther and he plays it up just like Gene Hackman.\n\nParker Posey is perfection here.\n\nI don't think people REALLY understand that \u2018Superman Returns\u2019 (2006) was a direct sequel to \u2018Superman 2.\u2019 That's why Luthor knows where the Fortress of Solitude is and how Superman knocked up Lois.\n\nMost people I hear say that they just didn\u2019t really like how Brandon Routh portrayed Superman, but Brandon Routh captured the spirit of Chris Reeves perfectly. He looks just like him at that age (Reeves was also in his late 20s during the filming of the first 2 movies) and totally sold me on this being the same boy scout/awkward dork character from those films.\n\nI agree Kate Bosworth was miscast being too young to play Lois (she was 23, while Margot Kidder was older than Reeves during the earlier movies), but as far as acting goes she, much like Routh, captured old Lois very well.\n\nLuthor seducing a rich old lady to get him out of jail and inherit her money sounds like something he'd do in the past movies. It's absurd comedy! A staple of the old films.\n\nAnd most people complain that the ending was quick and convenient when that was the case with the earlier films as well (time reversal, anyone?).\n\nOverall, I love this movie and it gets more shit than it deserves.",

        "content": "I just rewatched *Due Date* (2010)*,* and this is what I think and want some more suggestions on movies like these:\n\n&gt;!Peter (RDJ) has his life on autopilot, super organized, always in control. Then Ethan shows up: unpredictable, wild, and goes with the flow. He throws Peter off balance, and Peter starts thinking, \"Maybe life doesn\u2019t have to be so planned? Maybe I can loosen up?\"!&lt;\n\nDoes that sound like the core of *Due Date*? If so, what other movies show a straight-laced character getting shaken up by someone opposite, leading to personal growth or just hilarious chaos?\n\nIt's like a \"someone flips your world upside-down\" vibe. Thank you so much to everyone who suggested can't reply personally, but thanks.",

They would bring in ten more before ending their mission on account of darkness, but at 7:40PM, according to the ship\u2019s record, they hauled up Body 19.\n\nThat was my grandfather.\u201d",

        "title": "Who has the best directorial streak when it comes to maintaining quality?",
        "content": "I think a streak is at least 4 films in a row.\n\nI was reading about Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s AFI Lifetime Achievement Award and some were quick to talk about his output in the 70s and how the following came out in succession and are now considered classics. \n\n* 1972 - The Godfather\n* 1974 - The Conversation\n* 1974 - The Godfather Part II\n* 1975 - Apocalypse Now\n\nHitchcock has an almost unparalleled filmography, but there were some stretches where all films are legendary:\n\n* 1958 - Vertigo\n* 1959 - North by Northwest\n* 1960 - Psycho\n* 1963 - The Birds \n* (1964 - Marnie)\n\nAfter \u201cFollowing\u201d, Nolan started strong with \u201cMemento\u201d but \u201cInsomnia\u201d was less well received. I didn\u2019t include TDKR since opinions are more divided.\n\n* 2005 - Batman Begins \n* 2006 - The Prestige \n* 2008 - The Dark Knight \n* 2010 - Inception \n\nWes Anderson\u2019s films have grown in their appraisal where Darjleeing or Life Aquatic are more appreciated than when originally released. I don\u2019t know if their inclusion is fair but his streak would be: \n\n* 1998 - Rushmore\n* 2001 - Royal Tenenbaums\n* (2004 - Life Aquatic)\n* (2007 - Darjeeling Limited)\n* 2009 - Fantastic Mr. Fox\n* 2012 - Moonrise Kingdom\n* 2014 - Grand Budapest Hotel \n\nJames Cameron\u2019s filmography has been pretty unassailable as far as impact goes:\n\n* 1984 - The Terminator \n* 1986 - Aliens \n* 1989 - The Abyss\n* 1991 - T2 Judgment Day\n* (1994 - True Lies)\n* 1997 - Titanic \n* (2009 - Avatar)\n* (2022 - Avatar: The Way of Water)\n\nMartin Scorsese has probably the best modern filmography of any director, but I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a 4 film streak in there. \u201cColor of Money\u201d isn\u2019t considered a masterpiece but - \n\n* 1980 - Raging Bull\n* 1982 - King of Comedy\n* 1985 - After Hours\n* (1986 - Color of Money)\n* (1988 - Last Temptation of Christ)\n* 1990 - Goodfellas \n* (1991 - Cape Fear)\n\nSpielberg like Scorsese above has one of the most respected filmographies overall - don\u2019t know if he has a streak per se. \n\n* 1981 - Raiders of the Lost Ark\n* 1982 - ET the Extra Terrestrial \n* 1984 - Indy and Temple of Doom\n* 1985 - Color Purple\n* (1987 - Empire of the Sun)\n* 1989 - Indy and Last Crusade \n\nAlfonso Cuaron probably qualifies as well. I don\u2019t like Y Tu Mama, but it\u2019s a modern classic at this point. I feel similarly about Roma, but it is acclaimed.\n\n* 2001 - Y tu mama tambien\n* 2004 - HP Prisoner of Azkaban \n* 2006 - Children of Men\n* 2013 - Gravity\n* 2018 - Roma\n\nLegends like Billy Wilder or John Huston or Agnes Varda have amazing work, but don\u2019t know if they have a streak. \n\nThe parentheses in the lists above are meant to indicate that their inclusion in that streak is up for debate.",
