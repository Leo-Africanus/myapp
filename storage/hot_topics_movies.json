        "content": "Just rewatched Whiplash and that ending hit different this time. Everyone talks about how epic the final scene is and it is but TBH it kind of cemented how much Andrew completely lost the plot by then.\n\nThe whole movie builds up this toxic cycle between him and Fletcher, and yeah, it looks like Fletcher is the manipulative villain while Andrew is just this ambitious underdog. But by the end, it\u2019s not that simple. Andrew needs Fletcher\u2019s validation. He\u2019s been so brainwashed that he\u2019ll go to any length for that one moment of acknowledgment.\n\nAnd Fletcher.. well he\u2019s a wreck too. He loses his job, his respect, everything but still clings to this idea that greatness only comes from suffering. In that final scene, he basically traps Andrew, tries to humiliate him and Andrew still gives him what he wants. It\u2019s messed up. They\u2019re not enemies, they\u2019re enablers.\n\nThere\u2019s no real \u201cwinner\u201d here. They both pushed each other past the edge. And while it ends with that incredible solo, it\u2019s not triumphant. It\u2019s tragic. Andrew isn\u2019t free..he\u2019s all in, and there\u2019s no coming back. He\u2019s chasing this impossible standard that\u2019ll probably destroy him.",

        "title": "'Havoc' - Review Thread",
        "content": "Director: Gareth Evans\n\nCast: Tom Hardy,  Jessie Mei Li, Timothy Olyphant, Forest Whitaker, Justin Cornwell\n\nLogline: *After a drug deal gone wrong, a bruised detective must fight his way through the criminal underworld to rescue a politician's estranged son, unravelling a deep web of corruption and conspiracy that ensnares his entire city.*\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [67/100](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/havoc_2025)\n\n**Metacritic:** [59/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/havoc/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - David Rooney](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/havoc-review-tom-hardy-gareth-evans-netflix-1236198216/)\n\n&gt;With Hardy in fine form at the wheel, *Havoc* knows what its audience wants. It also looks great, with regular Evans DP Matt Flannery\u2019s dynamic cameras zipping in and out of the bloody fray and textured visuals slashed with throbbing colors. The setting is a city so grim and seedy it seems to exist only at night. The fact that the environments were mostly constructed at a studio in Cardiff suggests there\u2019s lots of ace craftspeople hiding out in Wales.\n\n[SlashFilm - Chris Evangelista](https://www.slashfilm.com/1842207/havoc-movie-review-tom-hardy-gareth-evans/)\n\n&gt;To be clear: I love a good, violent action movie as much as the next dude, but you have to give me something more than just one extreme shootout followed by another. Perhaps if the hyperviolence was a little more stylized it would play better. Instead, it's just ugly stuff repeated in numbing fashion. By the time \"Havoc\" ended, I felt as exhausted as Hardy's beaten and bruised character. I suppose Evans and company deserve some credit for making an action movie that really leans into the brutality, but there's only so much of that you can put up with before it starts to grow tedious.\n\n[Variety - Peter Debruge](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/havoc-review-tom-hardy-gareth-evans-1236375320/)\n\n&gt;There\u2019s a reason big-studio producers looked to Sundance darlings like Colin Trevorrow, Rian Johnson and Jon Watts to handle their tentpoles: not because those guys are great at action, but because they keep the interpersonal dynamics interesting. That\u2019s precisely where Evans wreaks the most havoc, ignoring (or simply not understanding) what connects us to such characters in the first place \u2014 and therefore ensuring that his unwieldy Netflix vehicle is dead on arrival.\n\n[NextBestPicture - Giovanni Lago](https://nextbestpicture.com/havoc/) \\- 6/10\n\n&gt;After years of waiting, it feels like \u201cHavoc\u201d was never going to reach the pre-conceived levels of hype that it was supposed to live up to. It\u2019s clear that whenever certain moments were filmed years later than the original period of principal photography (mainly due to Hardy\u2019s more than apparent changes in beard thickness), there\u2019s doubt it made any real difference in the final cut that Evans envisioned. Still, when \u201cHavoc\u201d hits, it only reminds us how awesome it feels when Evans gets to do his own thing. Even a flawed Gareth Evans film satisfies more than most action flicks today.\n\n[Empire - Beth Webb](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/havoc/) \\- 4/5\n\n&gt;There\u2019s also something refreshingly egoless to it; Hardy may have top billing but takes not only many sucker punches to the face but an entire roof to the head. Around him Evans utilities his full cast, throwing greener actors like Quelin Sepulveda, who plays Charlie\u2019s partner Mia, into the eye of the storm, armed with a meat cleaver and a mission to survive. The result is a throbbing, bone-crunching diorama of violence with the occasional horrifying, glorious flourish (you\u2019ll never want to see a fishing harpoon again).\n\n[Slant Magazine - Jake Cole](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/havoc-review-tom-hardy-gareth-evans/)\n\n&gt;Instead of elaborate exchanges of close-quarters strikes and counters, the characters here tend to get the upper hand based on who has the quickest reflexes in tackling an assailant or getting a block up at the last possible second. Despite the advanced choreography that Evans and Flannery capture with a generally superior sense of visual fluidity than they displayed in the *Raid* movies, there\u2019s an overwhelming sense of chaos here that feels realistic.\n\n[Nick Schager - The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/tom-hardys-havoc-review-the-action-extravaganza-of-the-year/)\n\n&gt;*Havoc* is such relentless, hardhearted business that the squeamish need not enlist. Nonetheless, those with a hankering for escalating insanity will be well satiated by this saga, whose narrative convolutions are untangled in a second half that puts a premium on combat. Disappointingly, Evans (who wrote the script) shortchanges Olyphant in a role that\u2019s barely one-dimensional and receives no stand-out moments\u2014to a large extent because he shares only scant screen time with Hardy. The director makes up for it, however, with a barrage of broken bones and mutilated corpses\u2014and set pieces drenched in slow motion and decorated with flying glass, splinter, and bodily debris\u2014that tips the material into sensory-overload territory.\n\n[Collider - Tania Hussain](https://collider.com/havoc-movie-review-netflix-tom-hardy/)\n\n&gt;*Havoc* might deliver on its promise of blood, guts, and glory, but it\u2019s these committed performances that keep it from completely collapsing under its self-induced chaos. While the vision by Evans swings hard as a stylishly savage brawler, it rarely lands with meaning, which also feels like an injustice to the filmmaker\u2019s incredible past work. Despite a top-tier cast and bone-rattling action to keep you engaged, the Netflix flick buckles under a cluttered story with chaotic execution. It\u2019s watchable, even entertaining in bursts \u2014 but beneath all the bruises and broken bones, there\u2019s not much else to hold onto.\n\n[IndieWire - David Ehrlich](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/havoc-review-netflix-tom-hardy-1235117850/?utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter) \\- B-\n\n&gt;Rote as Evans\u2019 plot might be, and wasteful as its treatment of certain characters *definitely* is (pour one out for Jessie Mei Li, whose screen time as Walker\u2019s new partner greatly outweighs her purpose to the story), he has a well-developed ear for ice-cold gangster speak, and he isn\u2019t afraid to make people pay a steep price for their penance. It\u2019s enough to forgive him \u2014 and/or the movie gods \u2014 for making us wait so long to see him do it again.\u00a0",

Sandberg, based on the 2015 video game of the same name. The story follows Clover and her friends as they venture into a remote valley to investigate the mysterious disappearance of Clover's sister, Melanie. They find themselves trapped in a time loop, reliving the same night where they are hunted by a masked killer.

This isn't necessarily about their worst or least successful film, but rather about a movie that serves as the wrong starting place to their career. Their first film is off-limits, choosing that would be too easy and feel like a cop-out. The film should stand out in some distinct way from the rest of their work, which makes the question even more interesting and more difficult when applied to someone with a long and varied career.\n\nSome examples might include Arnold Schwarzenegger in Junior, Francis Ford Coppola's Jack, Kevin Smith's Red State, or Judi Dench in The Chronicles of Riddick.",

You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours. Otherwise, what's the point? And for a while, that's the kind of love I believed I had\". \n\nHow did Ace ever trust Ginger as much as he did? He's a smart guy, and suspicious of everyone. He knew she was a hustler/grifter. And there are moments pretty early on where she blatantly lies to him or cheats him--when she takes money for a drink and doesn't give him change and says she spent it on some tables on the way back; when she calls Lester after their wedding. \n\nI don't get why he was so blind to her being untrustworthy to the point he gives her the only key to the money that might need to be used to get him out of trouble. (And I'm surprised she didn't take any of it before the end of things.)\n\nAm I missing something--why did Ace think he had the kind of love where he could trust her with everything when she never showed herself to be worthy of that trust in the first place?
