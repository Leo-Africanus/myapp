Vincent is relaxed, joking, eating junk food, while on his way to commit \"a hit\". Through this conversation we learn he has a casual, almost careless personality. Jules is a listener. He's more contemplative, but also more of an authority figure. This scene humanizes them both and makes the following sequence that much more shocking.",

        "content": "I just watched Scarface (1932) for the first time, and in a few years time this movie will be 100 years old by 2032. It just blows my mind because we've now gotten to the point where movies as we know them have been around for 100 years, right around the end of the silent movies of the 1920's.\n\nBut what's surreal to me like in the movie above, it really does feel like stepping 100 years in the past. I purposely listen to the dialogue to see how things have changed from then till now, and one line in the movie has a police officer say, \"If you play ball, we'll play ball,\" which is still a phrase you hear people say today. Of course I know I'm watching a gangster film so I know some lines will be embellished a bit, but it really feels like a history lesson. Some of the lines of dialogue are still spoken normally today despite this being nearly 100 years ago.\n\nLike just watching a dinner scene seeing the characters talk and pour themselves wine and discuss their day, doesn't seem much different than modern times Then you realize this movie came out before World War II even during the prohibition era and right after the stock market crash of 1929, and it's surreal.",

        "content": "A whirlwind of a Sci-Fi Action Comedy that grabs the viewer\u2019s attention and never lets go, \"Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die\" is possibly the most original, eccentric film of the year. Chasing a team of A List actors, the film follows extreme exaggerations on relevant topics causing the universe being observed to feel bizarrely alien yet simultaneously close to home. The comedic absurdity that infects the screen while holding a solid foundation in storytelling and continuity clearly showcase the artists full sail dive into trusting their instincts while being given the complete freedom to do so. Overall, this phenomenal film comedically highlights on the concern over Al and humanity\u2019s growing transfixion for technology while providing a journey that is truly a trip worth taking.",
