Arguably the best character (and in general) writing I\u2019ve seen from a horror movie, they did everything right that they could, they were a group of scientists and they all acted like it. All came up with perfect plans to survive and figure out the monster. The movie didn\u2019t have to rely on dumb characters to move the plot forward, they instead gave us incredibly smart characters that ended up having no choice but to fail in the end. Plus that ending, so masterfully done, cliffhangers suck until it\u2019s something like that. Keeps you thinking about the movie long, long after you\u2019re done watching it. Absolute 10/10 in my book.",

        "title": "How would The Lord of the Rings films be if they had stuck to Miramax's vision?",
        "content": "So basically, back in 1997 after Peter Jackson's original version of King Kong got cancelled, Jackson moved onto Lord of the Rings when it was already set up at Miramax. It was basically envisioned as this: one Hobbit film, then two Lord of the Rings films under Miramax but UA actually owned the film rights to The Hobbit so they basically just decided to do two Lord of the Rings films and do The Hobbit down the road as a prequel.\n\nWell, Peter Jackson tried to talk Miramax into doing three films but there were intent on only doing two Lord of the Rings films, the first film covering Fellowship of the Ring and Two Towers and the second film covering Return of the King. And Jackson agreed to it for a while. Then somehow during pre-production, Disney CEO Michael Eisner looked at the budget which was $75M a piece for these two films. So basically, after that: Miramax wanted to tell the whole story all in one film. Here's what changes that Jackson made for Miramax's version.\n\n&gt;Between the synopsis and the treatment, Jackson decided to cut Gildor, Crickhollow, the Old Forest, Tom Bombadil, the Barrow-wight, Bill Ferney, Radagast, Lothlorien and Ghan-Buri-Ghan. The final treatment divides the story into two parts: The Fellowship of the Ring (which covered the novel of that name, and The Two Towers) and The War of the Ring. The first opens immediately with the Battle of the Last Alliance (in what Jackson called a \"James Bond\" opening) and ends with Saruman's death, and Gandalf and Pippin (the latter having looked into the Palantir) going to Minas Tirith\n\n&gt;In this treatment, Farmer Maggot and Glorfindel are present; Gwaihir and Gandalf visit Edoras after escaping Saruman, and Eowyn and Eomer help him find Shadowfax against the wishes of a possessed Theoden. Gollum attacks Frodo when the Fellowship is still united, a struggle during which the Ring falls into the mud and is picked up by Boromir. Bilbo attends the Council of Elrond and Sam looks into Galadriel's mirror. At the end of the film, Saruman is shot by an overhead Nazg\u00fbl and, before his death, is redeemed through issuing the Palantir for Gandalf to look into. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are sent south to espy Sauron's forces, and Frodo and Sam are en route to the Black Gate.\n\n&gt;The second film opens in the thick of battle, and ends with Frodo sailing to the West. It features a more pronounced romantic triangle with Arwen and Eowyn, including a scene of Aragorn and Eowyn \"asleep in each other's arms\"; and has Elladan, Elrohir and Erkenbrand join Aragorn on the Paths of the Dead (the latter dying in the process), which are described as though made of flesh. The Nazgul just make it into Mount Doom before they fall.\n\n&gt;In this version, Farmer Maggot and Fatty Bolger appear. Gandalf is more frail and has given up pipe-smoking, and Gimli's dialogue contains several vulgarities. Sam, Merry and Pippin are all caught eavesdropping behind the door and forced to go along with Frodo. The Nazgul skewer Barliman Butterbur and Wargs attack the Hobbits near Weathertop. Gandalf's account of his time at Orthanc was pulled out of flashback and Lothl\u00f3rien was cut, with Galadriel doing what she does in the story at Rivendell. Denethor attends the Council of Elrond with his son. The Watcher in the Water, absent from the treatment, is reinstated. Arwen now rescues Frodo instead of Glorfindel, and later joins the battle of Helm's Deep, where a Nazgul sweeps in, only for its fell beast slain by Gimli. Indeed, Theoden's palace is placed in Helm's Deep itself. While on the Seat of Seeing, Frodo sees the Nazgul, having killed Saruman, attack Gandalf. He puts on the Ring to draw him away and is attacked by a fell-beast, which Sam lassos to the structure. The Nazgul attacks Sam before Frodo kills it.\n\n&gt;The second script included a sex scene between Aragorn and Arwen in the Glittering Pools, interrupted by Legolas and Gimli's sight-seeing the caves. Arwen later fends off a Nazgul that menaces Pippin and joins the Rohirrim. The writers considered having Arwen absorb \u00c9owyn's role entirely by having her kill the Witch-king, with the resulting wound becoming the source of her illness. Faramir finds Frodo after Denethor sends him to do so, having learned the secret of the quest from Pippin. Imrahil and Forlong appear in the script, and Aragorn fights Sauron in front of the Black Gates\n\n&gt;Bob Weinstein commissioned Jack Lechner to sketch a one-film version of the story. Lechner saw the story as too \"dense\" and that any two-film version would have left audiences unfulfilled since the story was only \"half-told\". He thought Frodo was a weak character. On 17 June 1998, he sent a memo in which he suggested cutting Bree and the Battle of Helm's Deep, \"losing or using\" Saruman, merging Rohan and Gondor, and making \u00c9owyn Boromir's sister, shortening Rivendell and Moria (losing the Balrog and the fight in Balin's Tomb in the process) as well as having Ents prevent the Uruk-hai from kidnapping Merry and Pippin.\n\nEven Peter Jackson admitted that cutting out half of the good stuff was not a good idea at all despite Miramax trying to force him to do at first, one four-hour film, then one two-hour film. In fact, Harvey Weinstein told Peter Jackson that Weinstein wanted Quentin Tarantino to direct it but the idea was shut down. Eventually, Miramax let Peter Jackson shop around the film but limiting the turnaround window to four weeks so that they could force Peter Jackson to do the one-film version. Before the four-week period was over, Jackson found a buyer with New Line to distribute, finance and produce these movies and not only that, Bob Shaye convinced Peter Jackson to do three Lord of the Rings movies, not two of them and the rest is history.\n\n",

        "content": "**Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread**\n\n* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/captain_america_brave_new_world): 54% (41 Reviews)\n* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/captain-america-brave-new-world/): 47 (13 Reviews)\n\nReviews:\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/02/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-marvel-reboot-1236286418/):\n\n&gt;Director Julius Onah (*Luce)*\u00a0and a boatload of writers provide plenty of oppotunity for Mackie to show his strengths although Evans\u2019 Steve Rogers is a tough act to follow. That fact is even alluded to at one point, but watching Mackie taking Sam Wilson into the big leagues is a game effort with room to grow.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-1236303617/):\n\n&gt;Wilson\u2019s Captain America lacks the serum-enhanced invincibility that defined Rogers. He\u2019s a hand-to-hand combat badass, but far more dependent on his shield and wingsuit, both of which are made of vibranium. You could say that that makes him a hero more comparable to, say, Iron Man (though Tony Stark\u2019s principal weapon was Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s motormouth), and Wilson\u2019s all-too-mortal quality comes through in the sly doggedness of Mackie\u2019s when-you\u2019re-number-two-you-try-harder performance. But on a gut level we\u2019re thinking, \u201cWasn\u2019t the earlier Captain America more\u2026super?\u201d\n\n[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-marvel-1236133439/):\n\n&gt;At 118 minutes,\u00a0*Captain America: Brave New World*\u00a0thankfully runs on the short side for a Marvel movie, but under the uninspired direction of Julius Onah (*Luce*,\u00a0*The Cloverfield Paradox*) it feels much longer. Even the CGI special effects prove underwhelming, and sometimes worse than that. It is a kick, though, to recognize Ford\u2019s facial features in the Red Hulk, even if the character is only slightly more visually convincing than his de-aged Indiana Jones in\u00a0that franchise\u2019s final installment.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/captain-america-brave-new-world-review/):\n\n&gt;\u201cCaptain America: Brave New World\u201d was directed by Julius Onah (\u201cLuce\u201d), but like lots of Marvel movies lately, it plays like it was made by a focus group. Everything looks clean, so clean it looks completely fake, and every time a daring choice could be made, the movie backs away from the daring implications. This is a film where the President of the United States literally turns red and tries to publicly murder a Black man, and yet according to \u201cBrave New World,\u201d the real problem is that we weren\u2019t sympathetic enough to the dangerously corrupt rage monster. This film\u2019s steadfast refusal to engage with its own ideas, either by artistic design or corporate mandate, reeks of timidity.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/captain-america-brave-new-world-movie-review-1235094677/) (C-):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s fitting enough that \u201cBrave New World\u201d is a film about (and malformed by) the pressures of restoring a diminished brand. It\u2019s even more fitting that it\u2019s also a film about the futility of trying to embody an ideal that the world has outgrown. Sam Wilson might find a way to step out of Steve Rogers\u2019 shadow, but there\u2019s still no indication that the MCU ever will.\n\n[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-red-hulk) (5/10):\n\n&gt;Captain America: Brave New World feels neither brave, nor all that new, falling short of strong performances from Anthony Mackie, Harrison Ford, and Carl Lumbly.\n\n[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/marvel-movies/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-mcu-marvel/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;Anthony Mackie's Captain America earns his Stars and Stripes in this uneven, un-MCU thriller. Sam Wilson and an always-excellent Harrison Ford drag Brave New World into unfamiliar narrative territory before it eventually succumbs to familiar Marvel failings\n\n[Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-mcu-anthony-mackie-1235251815/):\n\n&gt;While\u00a0*Brave New World*\u00a0is nowhere near as bad as the various MCU low points of the past few years, this attempt at both reestablishing the iconic character and resetting the board is still weak tea. The end credits\u2019 teaser \u2014 you knew there would be one \u2014 feels purposefully generic and vague, as if the powers that be became gun-shy in regards to committing to a storyline that might\u00a0[once again be forced to pivot](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/jonathan-majors-kang-marvel-fired-mcu-future-domestic-violence-loki-avengers-1234931990/). Something\u2019s coming, we\u2019re told. Please let it be a renewal of faith in this endlessly serialized experiment.\n\n[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;Pacy and punchy, this is a promising first official outing for the new Captain America, even if some awkward and inconsistent moments hold it back from greatness.\n\n\\-------------------\n\nDirected by Julius Onah:\n\n&gt;Following the election of\u00a0Thaddeus Ross\u00a0as the\u00a0president of the United States,\u00a0Sam Wilson\u00a0finds himself at the center of an international incident and must work to stop the true masterminds behind it.\n\nCast:\n\n* Anthony Mackie\u00a0as\u00a0Sam Wilson / Captain America\n* Danny Ramirez\u00a0as\u00a0Joaquin Torres / Falcon\n* Shira Haas\u00a0as\u00a0Ruth Bat-Seraph\n* Carl Lumbly\u00a0as\u00a0Isaiah Bradley\n* Xosha Roquemore\u00a0as Leila Taylor\n* J\u00f3hannes Haukur J\u00f3hannesson\u00a0as\u00a0Copperhead\n* Giancarlo Esposito\u00a0as\u00a0Seth Voelker / Sidewinder\n* Tim Blake Nelson\u00a0as\u00a0Samuel Sterns / Leader\n* Harrison Ford\u00a0as\u00a0Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross / Red Hulk",

They don't move along the front of the top row then along the back, etc.  They always move around the mouth in some disorganized haphazard way.  Is this some sort of movie trope like hanging up phone calls without saying goodbye?  Why is this?  Does it seem to be more \"action oriented\" than using a normal brushing motion?  Do any of you actually brush your teeth this way?",

        "content": "Basically, I have watched VERY few movies in the last 15-20 years. When I was younger, I loved movies, watched many, and generally kept up with them and watched many of the classics and most notable movies. Now, however, I've seen maybe a dozen (at most) new and relevant movies in the last 15-20 years. I am looking to change that and catch up on lost time and good movies that have flown by me. What are your absolute must-watch movies that came out in the last 2 decades? Whether it be beautifully shot, a fantastic and engaging story, emotional or impactful, the reasoning behind it is up to you. Please keep your list to ideally around 5 movies, and please no MCU or other superhero movies (no hate whatsoever! just not my thing). This doesn't have to be your \\*personal\\* top 5 of the last 20 years, just movies you think are particularly important and should be watched. If I may sway your limited choices/recommendations in a particular direction, I am a huge fan of horror (paranormal to the front of the line), mind-fuck/psychological topics, general uniqueness, and just dark/spooky vibes. \n\nTL;DR Please list 5 or so of your most recommended movies from the last 2 decades. Respectfully, no MCU or superhero movies. ",

Whether they are from popular artisit or artist that have flown under the radar, they make me want to move to the beat. In my opinion, songs from film soundtracks are what define 80s music rather than the hits that play on the radio. Even if some radio hits were written for movies. For me, the movies from the 80s that had the best songs are *Night of the Comet, Transformers: The Movie, and The Wraith*. ",

        "content": "I had this movie on the back burner for literal years. Heard a little about why people weren\u2019t so hot on it when it released, understood why. I had zero expectations really besides the trailer and knew it wasn\u2019t some space faring action movie. \n\nTo be honest I don\u2019t even love the plot but I think it was the world really. It\u2019s one of the few movies that made you really feel how exhausting and long space travel could be. It really felt like I went on a journey with the protagonist. It felt absolutely grande from the opening on the space antenna, to the launches and vistas arriving on different planets. \n\nI loved how we watch Roy take his journey starting on a commercial flight, to the more treacherous journey to Mars and eventually beyond. By the time we got to Neptune I really felt like we were billions of miles away from where we started on Earth. It felt mysterious every step of the way. \n\nBy no means was this movie perfect but it left me wanting more. Despite plot holes or characters not having enough dialogue it felt so realistic. It really felt like this could be what a future in space looked like. I loved all the little details and things that just made me think like how the one character he met on mars was born there! How insane is that?! The whole time I kept thinking of the logistics of getting everything to these planets as well, it must have been a huge effort. \n\nThe action and suspense I thought was sprinkled in very well. The strange space pistols, pirates, the way how there was minimal sound when explosions and bullets are flying on the moon. The incident on the Cepheus too, so brutal how that one woman died during take off. \n\nSo much of it was so raw and intense. I think the minimal and somewhat flat dialogue actually made it feel more real. The research baboon was such a shock to me too. I loved that idea and it was horrifying. I feel like you could tell a million stories in this universe without things getting too alien or paranormal. I was honestly expecting aliens in the end, but I think not getting them was the right choice but I still would have loved to see how this movie portrayed it. \n\nI don\u2019t know what it is that makes me love this movie so much, it\u2019s only grown on me since I\u2019ve seen it. I think it\u2019s an amazing example of how a movies world building and aesthetics can truly draw you in and give you something besides the story to lean on. \n\nFor me this movie was the definition of \u201cit\u2019s about the journey not the destination\u201d there\u2019s been recently. I\u2019d loved to hear others thoughts, I know this movie was mildly received but it\u2019s not often we get something unique like this imo. ",

        "content": "My take is probably more humanized. The question is, why did Henry (Michael Rooker) kill Becky (Tracy Arnold)? \n\nA scene which is telling is when Becky tells Henry how she loves him and his response was \"I Think I love you\", not \"I Love you\", which means he didn't love her, though I still think he had some fondness for her. Henry didn't know what love was, he never had it, but Becky was someone who treated him kindly. \n\nIf Henry was planning to kill Becky all along, he would have done it so in the apartment with Otis (Tom Towle). We've seen how he's not shy of killing his victims at the same time.\n\nI think from Otis' murder to them in the Motel, he was conflicted and trying to know what he should do next, and I believe, in the end, he decided Becky was excess baggage. He said earlier how he's a loner and he moves from city to city by himself. He could never do what he did with Becky in tow, especially since she had a child, and unlike Otis whom he saw a fellow psychopath, Becky would end up causing him problems. So he kills her. \n\nEven when he leaves the bloody suitcase, he has a moment where he stops and seems to show some sadness, some regret. Because he did like Becky. She was probably the only person who showed him kindness and cared about him. But in the end, Henry is a psychopath who thrives in murder and that was his first instinct. \n\nWhat is your take? Do you see it differently?",

I mean movies that take a light and humorous approach to dealing with issues like anxiety, depression, loss, and other similar issues. I recently saw a film about loss but the movie was way too depressing and I did not finish watching it, so got me thinking that it's best to try to find films that while they let you face the reality the approach is not all serious and humorless.\n\nLittle Miss Sunshine does it so well. I mean it deals with &gt;!suicide attempt!&lt;for God's sakes, that's how it begins! Not exactly funny. Serious stuff. And the family all got their neuroses and ticks and mistaken assumptions about the world. They can't relate to each other, have their own dreams that are bound to fail, yet share a common humanity that links them in a very deep level. Not just to each other but to us. So while we laugh at them, we also laugh with them because there is a little of bit of that in all of us.",
