The pair's view turns deadly after a police confrontation, setting off a tragic chain of events that forces a reckoning with power, principle, and the limits of freedom.\\]\n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_T4JHPowGbg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T4JHPowGbg)\n\nAsk me anything, reddit.

But few of them show society actually breaking down, the panic, the looting, the chaos. That's where the real terror comes in for me. That turns it from Hollywood spectacle, to real life apocalypse.\n\nSo far, the movie that's come the closest was Greenland. World War Z was also pretty good. Zombies aren't real, but if they were, that's how it would go down. I haven't seen The Day After Tomorrow in about 40 years, but I seem to remember they did a pretty good job with society breaking down, too.\n\nWhat are your picks?\n\nEdit: I forgot about Don't Look Up. That movie was amazing.",

        "content": "My wife is currently watching a TV show and the episode is about a group of people who are kidnapping people and selling them. One of the women who is imprisoned is revealed to be the mastermind of the entire operation at the end of the episode. At one point, other members of the group come and take her away from an actual captive, but they still continue to act like she's a captive as well long after they're away from the person. There is absolutely no reason for them to do this except to continue to dupe the audience into thinking this woman is a captive as well.\n\nSo, this got me thinking about other things like this. Another one I can recall is in a horror movie where the character on screen is facing to the left and the creature pops out from behind him in a jump scare that is SOLELY for the camera. The character would never have seen her or even knew she was there.\n\nWhat are some other examples of this?\n\n  \nEDIT: Yes, it's an episode of Criminal Minds, for those asking.",

I tend to find horror enjoyable (sounds weird to some I\u2019m sure) but the movie that has horrified me and truly made me feel destroyed mentally was Jennifer Kent\u2019s: The Nightingale. It\u2019s interesting this film isn\u2019t a \u201ctrue horror\u201d film\u2026I just have never been haunted by a movie until I watched this.\n\nIf you feel the need for a movie to truly move you and change you please watch it, but if you have triggers definitely look up the themes of the movie. By no means does the Nightingale glorify the messed up themes\u2026I want to know what movies have scarred you for life; if you\u2019ve watched The Nightingale I would like to know your opinion (protect spoilers). I haven\u2019t met anyone, or had any friends who\u2019ve seen this movie without my recommendation.",
