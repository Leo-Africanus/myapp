        "content": "I enjoy Liam Neeson action movies because he doesn't just phone it in like other older action stars making action movies. They have a decent plot, well shot, and his acting is always good. The action is mostly well done, but some have a lot of cuts and bad editing. I will rate them in order of: 1: Action. 2: Story. 3: Everything else.\n\nI'm only ranking pure action movies, and he has to be the **main protagonist**.\n\n\n\n1. **Taken** - The one that started it all and still the best one. Great story and action.\n\n2. **Run All Night** - One of his best when it comes to pure action, and the plot is interesting with some twists.\n\n3. **Non-Stop** - Pure adrenaline, set on an Airplane, intriguing plot and twists.\n\n4. **Unknown** - Another one with great plot and twists. Action movie with mystery.\n\n5. **Darkman** - This is an underrated movie, it's a comic book adaptation, but I'll count it as an action movie.\n\n6.  **A Walk Among the Tombstones** - Detective movie with action and good story.\n\n7. **The Commuter** - Similar to Non-Stop but set on a train and just a fun movie.\n\n8. **Honest Thief** - Liam Neeson doing what he does best. Not bad.\n\n9. **Cold Pursuit** - Different from his other action movies, but a funny action movie with dark humor. \n\n10. **The Marksman** - Liam Neeson against the cartel, say no more.\n\n11. **Memory** - Generic action movie, not much to say.\n\n12. **Taken 2** - Disappointing sequel compared to original.\n\n13. **The Ice Road** - Not a bad movie, but it's more of a disaster movie with some action.\n\n14. **Retribution** - Below average. The whole movie takes place in a car, with some twists, and can be boring.\n\n15. **Absolution** - Yea this is one of his worst action movie, bad plot, bad acting, only little action scenes.\n\n16. **Blacklight** - Literally unwatchable trash with boring plot, avoid it. How did this cost 40m??\n\n17. **Taken 3** - Just for the fence scene, this deserves last place.",

It has had quite a lot of criticism from the drivers and fans for deceptive editing, exaggerated rivalries (like portraying drivers who are in reality friends as enemies), and in general misrepresenting the actual sitution.\n\nThe makers justify this by saying..\n\n&gt;A spokesperson for the producers of\u00a0*Drive to Survive*\u00a0said: \u201cThe stories we tell across a series of\u00a0*Drive to Survive*\u00a0are not fabricated, the narratives clearly follow real events. In order to help make Formula One appeal to a wider audience, we tell these stories in an entertaining and compelling way.\n\nBut I'm sure there's way worse examples?",

        "content": "Gotta say, when I first saw Groundhog Day, I thought it was just this dumb, funny movie. Bill Murray stuck in some miserable town, surrounded by annoying people and his coworkers like Chris Elliott and random locals who just wouldn\u2019t leave him alone. I mean, even I was annoyed by Stephen Tobolowsky. But that was the joke, right? You watched it for Bill's facial expressions as he gets tortured by the same day over and over again. That was the whole appeal, it was funny.\n\nBut then you get older, and suddenly you're like, Whoa. That\u2019s life, man. Yeah it's funny but it's also absurd and kind of sad.\n\nThe movie\u2019s actually...kind of deep when you watch it when you're older. Cause you realize real life is surprisingly repetitive. There are days you wake up and feel exactly like Bill Murray\u2014trapped in the same job, having the same small talk with the same people you secretly can\u2019t stand. And you just want out. Suddenly, those suicide scenes? Not so funny anymore.\n\nBill isn\u2019t just this smug, narcissistic jerk getting what he deserves. Well... he kind of is. But then you start to realize so are you. You think you're better than everyone around you. That you're destined for more. That this isn't the life you were meant to live.\n\nOkay, maybe that\u2019s just me.\n\nMaybe you guys all got your lives together and you\u2019re mature and selfless. Not me though and honestly, I kind of hate how relatable the movie has become.\n\nHave you ever had that experience with a movie?\n\nNot just discovering it\u2019s deeper than you remembered, but realizing it hits totally differently now? LIke you finally caught all the dirty jokes you missed as a kid. Or you rewatched something you loved and thought, Wow, this is way weirder than I remember. Or like a friend of mine once said that a movie her cherished and thought was profound turns out it was really dumb.\n\nWhatever the case, any movie that felt totally different when you watched it after a long time, feel free to share. Wonder if I should go back and watch some old movies I like btw, after a long time has passed now. Who know how it'll hit me now....",

The final act really enhances the eerie and nightmarish feel, especially the fluctuations in time and perception, and pinbacker's apparent superhuman durability and determination from his mania. Real freaky stuff, makes you question our understanding of our universe, and whether something supernatural is at work or not.",

        "content": "As the question asks, I wanted to know if anyone else has a story like mine. For me, the choice was a toss-up between Daredevil starring Ben Affleck and Atlantis: The Lost Empire. After thinking it over, I have to give it to Atlantis. I loved that film for everything it was and what it represented to me.\n\nI saw it in theaters with someone very important to me, someone who has since passed away. To this day, I can't watch it without tearing up a little. I remember that person, of course, but I also find myself marveling at how much I still love the characters, the world, and the experience. I often wonder when the last time was that I felt so deeply immersed in a Disney animated film.\n\nI can\u2019t speak for anyone else, but that theater experience was unforgettable. As a kid, I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around how they pulled off the animation, the angles, the sense of movement, the way it felt like we were surfacing through water. It was stunning.\n\nAnd to add another layer, the person I saw it with was a big fan of Jim Varney, who voiced a character in the film. Atlantis was his final role, which made it all the more meaningful.\n\nSo, what about you? What film holds a special place in your heart, and why? I\u2019d love to hear your stories. Hopefully, this discussion helps us all reconnect with the love of film and those unusual gems that manage to capture our hearts.",

        "title": "Possession (1981) is an absolutely batshit insane movie - I'm still not sure how I really feel about it",
        "content": "Just finished this 1980s horror cult classic and holy shit bruh...this movie is the definition of \"wtf did I just watch?\". Just an absolutely bonkers, over-the-top story that's equal parts genius and ridiculous. \n\nIt took me a little bit of time to really latch on to the narrative, because it's so purposefully heightened and melodramatic. The dizzying camerawork, the unhinged, overacted performances and the gradually escalating luridness creates a truly demented and nightmarish atmosphere. Honestly, it's worth watching for pure vibes alone. \n\nIsabelle Adjani is what everyone talks about when mentioning Possession, and I think her performance mostly lives up to the hype. It's just complete commitment to the role, no holds barred. The infamous subway scene is as wild and jaw-dropping as advertised. Sam Neill deserves a lot of credit too, for playing a character almost as fucking nutty as his wife. His portrayal of a man seeing his marriage fall apart and realizing he has no control over it is pretty damn impressive.\n\nIn fact, the first thing that I thought of when I finished it is that Andrzej Zulawski was definitely fuckin' going through it. The entire narrative felt like a representation of a man experiencing the end of his marriage, not being able to come to terms with it and desperately doing whatever he can to hold on to a relationship that's already over and beyond repair. To that end, the ending, &gt;!with the creature turning into a \"better\" version of Mark, seems to indicate that he's been well and truly replaced!&lt;\n\nReally, the horror element is surprisingly almost a sidenote - I was expecting the movie to have much more straight-up horror-esque elements than it actually did. This isn't bad really, just unexpected. The squid monster thing seems almost symbolic a lot of the time. \n\nIn terms of why I'm conflicted about the movie...even though I found it fun, well-made and something I'll probably remember for a while, the extremely heightened nature of the story and the atmosphere is a *lot* to take. The entire movie is one giant crash-out, everybody speaks like they're in a mental institution, there's sooo much screaming and yelling, and unless you remind yourself that it's purposefully designed to be absurd, the campy overacting can be grating and unintentionally hilarious.\n\nWith that being said - this is a truly unique cinematic experience. It really feels like a waking nightmare and it never stops making you feel uncomfortable - which is really what the best horror movies manage to achieve.\n\nApparently there's a remake in the works, which to me seems like an awful idea. The untethered, no-limit insanity of this movie is what makes it work and I really can't see a modern remake capturing the tone - or a modern actress embodying what Isabelle Adjani pulled off. \n\n",

        "content": "I was watching Independence Day again on the 4th of July as one does, and decided after a decade maybe I was too hard on Resurgence and maybe I should try again.\n\nThe first bit of the movie before the aliens arrive I was like wow, this is a good movie, maybe I was just overly critical when I was younger; however, what the actual fuck is the second half of that movie?\n\nI have no problem with sci-fi world building, in fact it's one of my favorite things in fiction, but by god, none of it made sense in it's own continuity, when compared with the original film, or with just a basic understanding of science.\n\nFirst of all, why in the everloving fuck would they care about our molten core?  There is a near infinite amount of planets with a molten core and I'm gonna venture based on our current discovery of alien races most of them don't have sapient races.  Does that mean they specifically go after other races just to be dicks?  Makes no sense.\n\nBeyond that, I just have no words for the entire end and the queen fight.  Just what the fuck.  Also, the accountant who learns to fight aliens can go to hell too.  I just, can't even.",

        "content": "Sexy Beast is an iconic English Gangster movie, beautifully filmed and has an excellent pace. At 84 minutes, it packs a nice concise punch, and leaves you wanting more. Starring Ray Winstone (Gal) and Ben Kingsley (Don Logan). \n\nIf you've not seen this film, then please do, it is incredible. The performance Ben Kingsley gives as Don Logan will leave you genuinely chilled to the bone. I sincerely do find Don more scary than Anton because Don Logan is the sort of psychotic you might have even experienced in life - he wears violence on his sleeve, he is unhinged, and needs to be in absolute control, but under the surface, you have this tormented soul who is anything but in control. When Gal tries to leave his life of crime behind him and just relax in Spain, Don is tasked with offering him a job to do, when Gal refuses, things get tense. \n\nThis film does not have masses of physical violence.. the violence is psychological, and it comes in spades in this film. I promise you that you will love this film - you might want sub titles because the cockney accents are strong with this one. Please watch it, and please enjoy.",

I dunno. I just don't want it to be about anything serious or depressing. Stuff I have found interesting is for example people trying to make movies that either turn out to be awful or just the production is extremely troubled. Or when something goes wrong and it causes a huge chaotic fallout that a lot of people have to deal with. (without anyone's life getting actually, completely ruined)\n\nHopefully im not rambling too much. If anyone does have recs, thank you so much. And have a great day!\n\nEdit: Just came to say, I wasn't expecting this many replies, and again thanks so much. I have a wide selection to choose from and I really appreciate it!",
