The movie isn\u2019t perfect by any means, but something about the atmosphere. The perfectionist killer going over all the details making sure everything is right. (Even though he is not really as perfect as he thinks) \n\nAs the title implies, I\u2019m looking for suggestions for movies similar to this. They don\u2019t all have to be Hitman movies. Any movie that has the same type of feel, with super perfectionist detail orientated characters. ",

It is just mind-boggling for me how she switches so effortlessly between roles in thoughtful \"arthous-y\" films on the one end (stuff like Notes on a Scandal, Babel, I'm Not There, Blue Jasmine, Carol and T\u00e1r), and Blockbusters and genre films on the other end (Lord of the Rings &amp; Hobbit, Indiana Jones 4, Robin Hood, Cinderella, Thor: Ragnarok, Ocean's 8, Borderlands). She also did many films that I would put in between these two categories (Elizabeth films, The Aviator, Nightmare Alley, Don't Look Up etc.).\n\nIt just seems to me like she isn't snobby at all and very open to try very different types of roles, as long as it is either interesting or fun.\n\nWho are other actors that you think have a similar career?",

I've heard it's one of the worst to ever win and gets worse as it ages, but it's also the only one I've missed in the 21st Century, so I feel like I have to watch it. \n\nWell... I'm really glad I rented the\u00a0David Cronenberg\u00a0film by accident, not the atrocious BP winner movie. May just go ahead and skip the 2004 movie...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4e4rayuxjw7e1.png?width=184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=304a677cd3cb4ec789ebc750f1568b5d17a789af\n\n  \n\n\n",

        "content": "Background, skip if ya want to: I'm a teacher, and thus year I have a section of G8 English, where I have a lot of flexibility to take the curriculum where I want to/ where the students are responding. During a unit on horror literature, I often started class with a clip from (age appropriate) horror movies, and it was a fantastic way to get them very engaged and thinking actively about genre and technique. That unit is coming to a close now, and I'd love to be able to continue using film analysis here and there. Our next unit has the theme of home, and I'm having to think harder of good examples to show\n\nSo, any suggestion for movies that would help a group of 8th graders thinking about different depictions of the home? My first thoughts are the Shire/ Bilbo's house from LOTR, and Studio Ghibli (especially when Ponyo first comes to the boys house and mom makes them ramen), but I need more!",

There's a lot of actual reviews that are weirdly negative (including a lovely quote of \"If you love Jesus and His story of redemption, do NOT watch this\") so I don't know if it's an attempt to balance them or just a campaign to try to boost it's rating. Has anyone noticed this on other films?",
