        "title": "The wife in Pursuit of Happiness is as almost completely justifiable",
        "content": "I grew up thinking the wife in Pursuit of Happiness was a bitch but as an adult, I completely understand her. \n\nThe movie tells us at the very beginning they were doing decently enough as a middle class/working class family *until* Chris invested their entire life savings into a portable bone-density scanner. A medical device whose concept and price tag would have been immediately bullshit to any sensible person. A man as intelligent as the movie sells Chris to be, would have to be extremely arrogant in order to pursue it. \n\nImagine you have a small child and your husband throws everything away on a delusional business idea. That alone alone would be justifiable enough for a divorce but to make matters worse, he refused to count his losses and get a real job to help support their family. She worked countless hours and seemed to do the brunt of the child care while he wasted all day and night trying to sell those machines. When he gives her last minute calls to tell her she\u2019ll have to pick up their son, he is almost sociopathic in his annoyance when she complains about how it effects her job or that she won\u2019t have any break. When she is finally at her wits end from the stress and desperation of their situation, he tells her that he wants to take a low paying internship to be a stockbroker. His wife and child were a breath away from starving on the streets while he jumps from one outlandish dream to the next. She was right to cut her losses at the moment. \n\nHer only failure was not fighting harder to keep custody of their son since she seemed to have slightly better financial stability and job security. She should not have let Christ guilt and bully her into believing their son was better off with him. Chris loved his son but a person who would selfishly allow their child to be homeless on the street so he could keep a low paying internship instead of getting a decent paying job has no right to keep custody of that child. Chris could have still been an active parent by visiting him instead of forcing his son to live that way. \n\nThe only reason why it\u2019s heartwarming is because he got the job in the end instead of he and his son being shanked one random night while living in public bathrooms. The reward doesn\u2019t justify the risk he took with his son\u2019s safety just so he could be a father. ",

        "title": "Which disaster movie gives the best feeling of \"calm before the storm\"(yes this can include horror like Zombies, it just has to be large scale)?",
        "content": " One of my favorite aspects of these movies is the moments before the disasters. We, the audience, know what is coming. The characters don't. It's this feeling that something big is unfolding and none of these characters has any clue that the world around them is about to end. \n\n We are often times treated to snippets of news reports in the background, often ignored by the main characters. They're either too busy with work, or they just flip the channel as soon as the news anchor describes a big event or breaking news comes on.   \n   \n If it's more horror-oriented, you think about which one of these characters is gonna die a horrible death. You fear for the family, you fear for the world in the movie.\n\nThe other aspect of these moments is that you attribute them to your own reality and wonder \"What if this was our situation, our moment before disaster?\"\n\n  \n For me, It would be like War of The Worlds and the Dawn of The Dead remake. \n\n  \nWar of The Worlds because the whole calm feels foreboding. You're with this family and you're seeing signs on the news about what is unfolding. Everything seems mundane but the vibe is just knowing shit is gonna go down and this family has no clue.\n\nDawn of The Dead because it gives a feeling of impending doom. Considering the type of movie it is. Because the whole scenario is horrifying so you're watching a glimpse of life before it turns into a nightmare..\n\n  \nBonus mention would be Threads, because the scenario can be a potential reality for us all, and we all relate to watching the news about wars and escalation. Especially since the Russian invasion. So it's more horrifying because it is a more relatable sense of dread and uncertainty.",

For me, it\u2019s the Layla piano exit by Derek and the dominos in GoodFellas, the montage of everyone in the crew getting whacked and the beautiful melody of Layla playing is absolutely iconic, that song is forever tied to GoodFellas in pop culture because of that scene!

        "content": "I'm not sure if this is the right sub, but I don't know where else to go sooo.\n\nI hear often that budgets are out of control for movie studios these days, and to be honest, I can see why. The numbers get bigger and bigger, yet for some reason (rushed employees in poor working conditions), they look worse and worse every year.\n\nBut I don't think the budgets are too high. Disney alone is worth almost 200 billion dollars, and to be honest, I don't understand that else they'd spend the money on. With that much money, their movies should cost that much, but should also be stellar in addition. What would be the point of massing all that money if not to put it back into the product. I think of it like content creators, who can afford to step up their game once their practice becomes sustainable.\n\nThough it goes without saying, what they should be doing isn't spending less money, but spending more time as well, instead of rushing to deadlines to please shareholders. I say all of this, but will admit that I'm young and not very familiar with this industry as a whole, and could easily be missing something, so I'd like to hear additional thoughts.",

        "content": "David Lynch has died. I am very young so I don't know a lot of his projects. But recently, just two days ago, I have seen The Straight Story.\n\nThe Straight Story is a movie about an old man who wants to visit his brother. Therefor, he travels 300 miles on a lawn mower. Can you believe it? You should, because it's based on facts.\n\nThe movie looks and sounds good. Beautiful landscapes mix with calm and melancholic music that feels like a soft summer breeze.\n\nOf course, the old man faces some challenges on his way. In Road Movie tradition, there are some stations he crosses, where he gets to know different kind of people.\n\nBut none of them are evil. Everyone is ready to help the man and the man is ready to help everyone. Humanity rules. The word \"Thank You\" means something. Characters inspire each other. Every new situation feels unique and valuable.\n\nThis makes \"The Straight Story\" a wonderful departure from darkness, be it natural, in our all lives, or fictional, before we press play on the next thriller.\n\nI enjoyed this little experience very much. \nEven though I come from germany, which is why my english may not be the very best, I want to say one thing....\n\nThank you, David Lynch.",
