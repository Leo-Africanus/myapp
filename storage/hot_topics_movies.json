        "content": "The general sentiment around the Craig era is that Casino Royale and Skyfall are masterpieces and the other films are either just \"okay\" or downright stupid/boring, definitely not must-rewatch material like the first and third.\n\nI couldn't help but notice that after Skyfall there seemed to be a misguided tonal shift. The first three movies definitely were trying to go for a more grounded-in-reality approach with real life stakes that felt relatable to our modern world (Terrorists/African warlords/Foreign coups). They definitely wanted to ditch the mustache-twirling evil-lair campiness of the earlier bond films in favor of making them as realistic as possible. They even hang a lampshade on this in Skyfall when Q says \"A gun and a radio. What were you expecting an exploding pen? We don't really go for that anymore.\"\n\nHowever in the last two films, they seem to ditch this attempt at over-realism and lean back into the campiness of the old era with notable silly/campy plot points such as the sinister shadowy men sitting around a giant golden table, or a killer nano-robot virus that targets DNA, or machines that can wipe your memories/mind-control you. The gadgets themselves also seem to have taken a 180. Despite them poking fun at the campiness of the older bond films with their high tech gadgets, they end up going back on it and added silly gadgets like the magical magnet balls that allow you float like in zero-gravity.\n\nKeep in mind there is nothing wrong with this approach if you wanted the whole franchise to be like this but the over-the-top campiness of the last two (and arguably bits of the third) definitely clash with the tone that was initially established in the first movie.\n\nThe later bond movies also seem to have an obsession with bond as a character with a sort of \"he's key to all of this\" approach whereas in the first couple movies Bond was just a normal expendable but highly-competent agent. They also pull the \"everything is connected\" card, and claim all the villains from the first movies were all secretly working together instead of just letting them stand on their own and have their own motivations.\n\nFor me personally, I got so attached to the way the first movie was presented that I just couldn't get on board with the last couple. I don't know how we went from targeting financial operations of terrorists to trying to stop killer micro robot infection missiles, and the jarring shift in tone is just too much for me to overlook as someone who prefers the more grounded movies.\n\nI still watch Casino Royale and Skyfall to this day, but I never had any desire to rewatch any of the others. Am I alone in this?",

The disease was progressive and by his teens he was wheelchair bound, his condition just got worse from there. In his adult life he became engrossed in the online RPG World of Warcraft, which saddened his family as he withdrew from them. However, Mats left them his login info for the game when he died...\n\nHis parents decided to log in and post a message on his account about his passing... they were immediately flooded with Mats' online friends reaching out with their condolences and stories of online friendship. The family digs into his account and discovers that Mats was not simply gaming, but living a very rich and fulfilling life in the game where he was not limited by his condition. He made many friends, genuinely affected those he cared about and even found love. His online community mostly had no knowledge of his real life condition.\n\nI cried multiple times, but absolutely bawled at the end at his funeral when some of his guildmates attended his funeral and the woman that he had a genuine, loving and complicated relationship with was one of his pall barers.\n\n15/10 - cannot reccomend it enough.",

Even though I feel bad for him, the way the scene plays out is still hilarious in a macabre sort of way. The two hitmen are so hilariously incompetant with how they're out to kill Tony but clearly kill the wrong person.",

Did they assume his violent tendencies from childhood would prevent him being successful as a cop, and then sought to use that weakness to their own advantage by having him go in with Costello? It is a noticeably violent environment, and surely a welcome challenge for someone as intelligent as Billy. Were they just setting him up for success in an unconventional way, while also making sure they benefitted from the arrangement? ",

The MPAA is pretty strict about showing gore in a PG-13 movie and this one's got brutal gunshots, severed fingers, graphic hangings, and a guy biting his tongue in half. I don't even think it deserves an R, it's just that movies this violent usually get one. ",

Think of the infamous \"he gets on base\" scene. All these scouts and execs are flabbergasted that Beane wants to bring on players on his team with what they believe have major deficiencies, but Beane is simply going by analytics when it comes to his decision making. It ends up revolutionizing how players are evaluated in baseball. Analytics in general end up taking over in other sports as well. \n\nAre there other movies like this? In any industry or line of work?, where traditional methods of thinking and decision making get challenged by new tactics, and those new tactics end up changing the industry moving forward?",
