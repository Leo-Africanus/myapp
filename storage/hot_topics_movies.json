        "content": "Hi r/movies! I'm Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, writer/director of I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, which is out in theaters nationwide starting today, Friday, July 18th.  I've also written and directed Netflix's DO REVENGE (starring Maya Hawke &amp; Camila Mendes), and written and directed Netflix\u2019s SOMEONE GREAT. Ask me anything!\n\nWhen five friends inadvertently cause a deadly car accident, they cover up their involvement and make a pact to keep it a secret rather than face the consequences. A year later, their past comes back to haunt them and they're forced to confront a horrifying truth: someone knows what they did last summer... and is hell-bent on revenge. As one by one the friends are stalked by a killer, they discover this has happened before, and they turn to two survivors of the legendary Southport Massacre of 1997 for help.\n\n**Here's our trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QABNfDhSxs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QABNfDhSxs)\n\nI KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is out in theaters nationwide starting today.\n\n**Bio:**\n\nJennifer Kaytin Robinson is making her theatrical debut in 2025 with the new installment of the cult classic I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, which she also co-wrote. The film features returning fan-favorites Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. reprising their roles from the original films, alongside a new generation of talent including Madelyn Cline, Chase Sui Wonders, Jonah Hauer-King, Tyriq Withers, Sarah Pidgeon, and Gabbriette.\n\nRobinson is also known for her sophomore directorial feature DO REVENGE for Netflix, which she also produced and wrote. The film is a darkly comedic high school reimagining of Hitchcock\u2019s \u2018Strangers on a Train\u2019. Its ensemble cast features Camila Mendes, Maya Hawke, Rish Shah, Austin Abrams, Talia Ryder, Alisha Boe, Sophie Turner and Sarah Michelle Gellar, and debuted at #1 globally on Netflix.\n\nHer feature directorial debut, SOMEONE GREAT, which she also wrote, premiered globally on Netflix in 2019. The cast includes Gina Rodriguez, Brittany Snow, DeWanda Wise, LaKeith Stanfield, and RuPaul, among others.\n\nHer additional credits include co-writing the screenplay for Marvel\u2019s THOR: LOVE &amp; THUNDER together with Oscar-winning filmmaker Taika Waititi, which grossed over $760 million worldwide; and co-writing the screenplay for the Max Original feature UNPREGNANT.  \n\n*Ask me anything! I'll be answering questions starting at 3 PM ET.*\n\n",

        "content": "We\u2019ve seen the repeated nostalgia pulls that feel narratively unnecessary - Space Jam Legacy, Jurassic World, Beverly Hills Cop Axel F, Exorcist Believer, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Jason Bourne, Karate Kid Legends, Dumb and Dumber To, Matrix Resurrection, Coming 2 America etc. Many of these are beat for beat remakes of the original. Hell Star Wars 7 is so similar to the plot of 4. \n\nBut then there\u2019s the okay to good to great ones Top Gun: Maverick, Finding Dory, Creed, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, Blade Runner 2049, Mad Max: Fury Road, Doctor Sleep, Best Man Holiday, T2 Trainspotting, Split and Glass, etc. \n\nAre there films you are eager for a sequel to even if it\u2019s been 5-10-25 years since the original where it makes sense to revisit these characters after time passed?

Amazing performances, a ridiculously great script, and for its time that had to have been a  bold ending to do it in that manner. I'm glad with movies like Game Night, the Kenneth Bragnah Nile adaptations and the Knives Out series we're seeing a resurgence of the genre, but I don't believe this movie will ever be topped. ",
