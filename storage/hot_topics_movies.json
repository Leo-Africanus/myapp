Who are some people like this? It doesn't have to be an actor or actress, it can be a writer, cinematographer, etc. I'm curious on what the outlier cases look like.",

There\u2019s the seedy motels. The downtown courthouse. The posh private school. The jalousie windows. The incessant cricketing of crickets. The music does a good deal of the heavy lifting. That base line alone is both tongue in cheek and moody. Just like the movie. The script is full of twists and turns. None need to make sense when you\u2019re having this much fun. The cast is more than game. If Bill Murray graces your set you must be doing something right. You also get a vintage Denise Richards on full display. I saw this in the theater and couldn\u2019t believe these mainstream actors were going all out exploitation on us. Find this flick and make it your next movie night.

        "content": "I was listening to a podcast today about the movie Evan Almighty and how many things went wrong with the movie. One part that went right was that the movie was the first to be completely carbon neutral, which I thought was really cool. Here is how they did it.\n\n\t\u2022\tCarbon footprint calculation: The production team first measured the estimated carbon emissions the film would generate (including transportation, energy use, construction, etc.).\n\tTree Planting Initiatives: Director Tom Shadyac required crew members to plant 2,050 trees at the Rappahannock River Valley National Wildlife Refuge in Virginia and the San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge in California.  \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tRecycling and Sustainable Practices: The production emphasized recycling, provided bicycles for crew members to reduce vehicle use, and used double-sided scripts to minimize paper waste.  \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tSet Material Donations: the ark in the movie was a real fully built ark! When production was over the are was deconstructed and materials from the ark set were donated to Habitat for Humanity instead of being discarded. \n\t\u2022\tUse of hybrid vehicles: The production used hybrid cars for transportation during filming to reduce fuel consumption and emissions.\n\t\u2022\tEco-friendly power: Efforts were made to reduce on-set energy use, including turning off equipment when not in use and optimizing energy efficiency.\n\t\u2022\tRecycling and waste reduction: On set, recycling programs and waste reduction initiatives were implemented, including composting and limiting single-use plastics.\n\nAll in all, I feel like these practices could be adopted more often. Thought it was a really cool story and wanted to share!\n",

        "content": "I almost missed out on Sinners in 70mm, so if this post comes off as a little petty, I admittedly am.\n\nI work in film myself, I love and live for the artform. Unfortunately, my unpredictable work schedule means I actually miss out on watching some good movies in theatres. My girlfriend and I have to coordinate our work schedules, and sometimes we're able to go on the third week. We both only got to see Sinners on the week of its return engagement in 70mm because IMAX agreed to it.\n\nLately, IMAX has been screening a lot of new releases for only a week or two, and rereleases for maybe 1-3 days. Michael B Jordan himself complained about the small 3 day window which he couldn't attend the screening of the 4K Princess Mononoke restoration. This is occuring quite often because IMAX has been adamant about signing contracts for as many films and experiences as possible. Sinners was not only kicked out of theatres to make way for Thunderbolts*, but also to make way for Fortnite Championship Series (which I can't understand how the audience would benefit from the extra pixels compared to a standard screen). Interstellar's infamously limited rerelease had advance tickets offered on eBay for hundreds.\n\nFurthermore, tickets are so hard to buy for the first week and sometimes even the second week. IMAX has unintentionally curated a toxic collecting culture around collecting different film strips every week (the artificial scarcity of those same strips selling for hundreds online). It has contributed to a toxic rewatch culture that takes away seats from potential first-time viewers. And IMAX only has so many screens available, which makes rewatch culture even more unfair when a second viewing could be on a standard screen instead.\n\nIMAX's greed is why a lot of cinemagoers who usually show up the second or third week have become jaded with movie theatres and just wait for the home release. Who can blame them when they're being marketed the best cinema experience only to be blocked out of attending because it's so hard to find good tickets for the entire IMAX run? IMAX has close to a monopoly on Premium Large Format where I live here in Canada (if they don't have one already). Again, I love cinema, but this is the reason I'm falling out of love with watching films in a theatre.\n\nWhat can IMAX do to fix this? Sign less contracts, IMAX should only screen 11 or 12 new releases each year, in 3-4 week runs. The extra weeks left over can be filled with rereleases that stay for 1-2 weeks. Make only one type of film strip  so that viewers aren't coming back to collect them all, and increase the supply so that everyone who wants to get one can get one.\n\nWhere will the other films go if they can't screen in IMAX? They can go to competing Premium Large Formats or standard screens (romcoms aren't made for IMAX, to be quite fair). There aren't enough IMAX screens to properly meet demand for the biggest films out there, so some films have to be pushed out to make way for longer engagements for other films.\n\nIf IMAX cannot change their ways and allow their screenings to stay an extra week or two so they can be more accessible, I think it's time to bet on another horse in the race. Maybe Dolby Cinema once they can open up enough screens worldwide. But preferably a format that can keep a film in theatres for roughly a month, as it used to be back in the old days. I'm speaking as someone who didn't have to worry about choosing between Spider-Man 2 or Shrek 2, because I could see them both in theatres on different days.",

When a new friend needs his help, Li enters a karate competition -- but his skills alone aren't enough. With help from Mr. Han and Daniel LaRusso, he soon learns to merge two styles into one for the ultimate martial arts showdown.*\n\nCast: Jackie Chan, Ben Wang, Ralph Macchio\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [58%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/karate_kid_legends/reviews)\n\n**Metacritic:** [53/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/karate-kid-legends/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Variety - Owen Glieberman](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/karate-kid-legends-review-jackie-chan-1236410862/)\n\n&gt;The original \u201cKarate Kid\u201d film remains the best one, because the novelty of subjecting Macchio\u2019s Daniel LaRusso to the \u201cWax on, wax off\u201d Buddhist training of Mr. Miyagi has never been duplicated. \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d is likable retro corn, but by the end you may just think: Ain\u2019t that a kick in the head.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - Frank Scheck](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/karate-kid-legends-review-1236230996/)\n\n&gt;True to its title, *Karate Kid: Legends* dutifully pays homage to its predecessors, even starting off with a clip from 1986\u2019s *The Karate Kid Part II* featuring a young Macchio and Pat Morita. There are numerous callbacks to past installments, and the end credits feature a cameo by one more franchise veteran. At one point, Daniel comments of his late mentor, \u201cEvery time I have a chance to pass on a piece of his legacy, it\u2019s never the wrong choice.\u201d The studio executives who greenlit this project would certainly agree.\n\n[The Wrap - Matt Goldberg](https://www.thewrap.com/karate-kid-legends-review-jackie-chan-ralph-macchio-ben-wang/)\n\n&gt;\u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d feels like two movies set against each other. One is standard issue \u201cKarate Kid\u201d fare that would have done fine as its own story, and the other is leaning hard on nostalgia despite not giving Mr. Han or Daniel anything to do other than train Li. It still manages to arrive at a fairly charming albeit unsteady picture that should win over a new generation of younger viewers. But for older members of the audience, the second half of \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d feels like an insecure fighter changing his approach halfway through a match.",
