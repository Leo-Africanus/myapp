        "content": "I watched the 2025 Frankenstein a day before watching Children of Men. I was about to joke how Frankenstein shows how badly men want to give birth and this film was definitely inspired by that but I can't.\n\nIt's too beautiful for that. The dystopian world in the film might seem hopeless but characters portray otherwise. There is this slick contrast between the world and the characters. They reek of courage and hope unlike the world.\n\nThe famous scene shot in one take when the fishes and army ceasfires after hearing a baby's cry is such a powerful one. For a moment the world seems full of hope and peace; all because of a baby. Only for the firing to begin right after. This as per me is a contrast between the world we can have and the world we have made into our reality. We keep getting glimpse of this hopeful world through different characters be it Theo, Julian, Jasper, Miriam, Marichka, the family that helped them and finally everyone; from the people in the building to the army when there was ceasefire.\n\nPersonally speaking I feel like this film portrays today's situation really well. We might not be infertile(yet) but the hatred people seem to have for one of their own knows no bound. Looking at it; everything may seems like the end of the world but then you meet someone like Theo, Julian, Jasper or Marichka and the world starts glimmering with hope.\n\nAlright, that's it. Thank you for listening to my Ted talks and I hope everyone of you get pregnent quickly.",

        "content": "On HBO Max, there is the Watchmen live action movie, an episodic series of the motion comic book, and a two chapter movie series; all telling the same story. Most of the visuals, flashbacks, and plots are the same.\n\nThe main differences I\u2019ve seen so far have mostly been when the information was given to the audience, whether this is when the flashbacks are cut into the present day narrative or the conversation pacing. An example of the latter being Rorschach\u2019s \u201cYou quit.\u201d in reply to Dan\u2019s musing of what happened to the \u201cgreat times\u201d. In on version, Rorschach waits a beat, and another he sharply cuts off Dan\u2019s question. This former shows Rorschach longs for his friend to take up the mantle again, while the latter shows Dan\u2019s abandonment stills hurts. That being said, it feels like every version is sharing both sentiments.\n\nEdit: What I\u2019m getting at is like you get to watch a different cut of your favorite movie, or how the scene would have played out in a different setting. Like the chronological cut of Pulp Fiction someone posted on YouTube years ago.",

        "content": "I remember (doing the time warp) when I was 13 years old. I am the son of a very conservative southern Baptist pastor, and a very conservative southern Baptist pastor\u2019s wife. We couldn\u2019t say fart in my family. That\u2019s enough context for this story.\n\n\nI was 13 and I had heard of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, but I had never seen it. I had just received a tv for my birthday a month prior, a little 13 inch color tv, and I was so proud of it. It was October and I stumbled across TRHPS on VH1. I was entranced, the music was amazing and it was scandalous and dirty and I am just watching it with eyes as wide as saucers. I\u2019m in the middle of sweet Transvestite, and I hear my mom knock and begin opening the door. I fumble the remote and Jesus, knowing my shame\u2026makes the remote not work. My mom walk in and looks at the TV, and I know I\u2019m busted. She\u2019s going to have a heart attack and call my dad in and I\u2019m going to get a lecture and possibly my tv taken away. My mom looks at me and I know what\u2019s coming\u2026.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re watching Rocky Horror\u2026I saw it in the theater.\u201d\n\n\nWhaaaaaaaat?!?!?!\n\nIt was on that day, 31 years ago that I realized my mom was cooler than me. Over the next few years I realized how cool she was. She could play any hymn by ear\u2026but she also knew Beth by KISS, Come Sail Away by STYX. She knew Alice Cooper, Ozzy, Led Zeppelin. She had been in a band as a teen with my cousin who grew up to play lead guitar for the Osmond Brothers, and his band has opened for Alice, and The Beach Boys, and David Cassidy, and STYX, and the Bay City Rollers. And she was just as cool. \n\nShe still is. She\u2019s slowed down a lot, she fell over Thanksgiving and broke her hand so she\u2019s not playing piano for a while. We\u2019ve been doing end of life planning as she is approaching 80, and my dad has Parkinson\u2019s, and she is giving me her 1974 Rhodes stage piano which is in absolute mint condition. All this has been on my mind lately and tonight I saw Rocky Horror was on Disney+. I had my 13 year old daughter come into my room and watch it with me, and told her this story of my rocker preachers wife mom. I think it\u2019s a cool legacy to hand down, and I just thought I\u2019d share it here.\n\nEven today, Rocky Horror Picture Show is one of the best rock operas in existence; and it is special to me because it reminds me that people are very complex\u2026even moms.",

        "content": "Over the years I've watched Blade Runner a couple of times, but it never sat right with me. I kind of understood why it is considered a masterpiece, but I also kind of didn't.\n\nI watched it again yesterday, and it finally clicked and I also know why: I watched the theatrical version for the first time. The one with Deckard's voice-overs. I don't remember ever having voice-overs in this movie, so it must be that before I've always watched Ridley Scott's Director's Cut or the Final Cut.\n\nI now understand that what I was missing was context. Blade Runner has always been awing me with its imagery and music, but I also found the dialogues to be on the philosophical rather than the logical side and I didn't understand why certain things were happening as they were. This took me out of the movie pretty early, thus I couldn't really appreciate what I was seeing. Now, with Deckard's voice-overs, I do. And the film finally works for me. And it makes me happy, because I too can now fully appreciate a milestone of filmmaking as much as so many other people do.",

        "title": "Movies where the language barrier hid some bad acting?",
        "content": "There's this low budget Japanese cult movie called Versus from 2000 or so that I was obsessed with as a kid. It's basically about a bunch of Yakuza that guys go to meet up with some escaped convicts in a forest where all the people they've killed over the years start rising from the dead, and it turns out both the convicts and the boss they were waiting for are more than they seem.\n\nNow according to the filmmakers, especially the director, the lead actor Tak Sakaguchi delivers his dialogue terribly in a lot of scenes, which I guess is unsurprising for an early effort from an inexperienced director like Ryuhei Kitamura was. I don't know if he's wooden in his inflection, emotes incorrectly, or what because I can't speak a single sentence of Japanese.\n\nRobert Rodriguez also speculated about his breakout feature El Mariachi that he figured Americans took it more seriously and got more out of it because the fact it was in subtitled Spanish convinced them it must be more highbrow that the kind of silly, contrived B movie that it he felt it actually was. One of the lead villains was 19 years old and delivered his lines very woodenly in Spanish but looked old enough to still be intimidating to an English speaker. \n\nAre there any movies you've seen from your home country being watched by people in other countries where you think you'd enjoy them less if they were native speakers of your language?",

        "content": "When it first came out, it only made 13 million. It had Macaulay Culkin in his last major film role, voicing an animated character who goes on an adventure with antromorphic books voiced by Whoopi Goldberg, Patrick Stewart and Frank Welker. Christopher lloyd as a wizard/librarian. A nice soundtrack with songs by Wendy Moten, Lisa Stansfield and Babyface. And a positive message about convincing kids to read, pretty much what The NeverEnding Story was supposed to be as well. But nobody saw it back then. \n\nNow, it's regarded as a cult classic, because many folks watched it on cable, home video. I discovered this movie thanks to a VHS tape that was lended to me and I loved it. Definitely my favorite 90s Hanna Barbera animated movie.",

        "title": "One of Jim Carey\u2019s finest performances is for a movie I don\u2019t see a lot of love for &amp; it\u2019s a real shame. Robert Zemeckis\u2019s 2009 \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d is a wonderful adaptation &amp; has become a holiday tradition for my family",
        "content": "So I\u2019ll admit when I first saw the 2009 version of A Christmas Carol starring Jim Carey, I was kind of unimpressed. Another Polar Express style film, this time costing 200 million dollars(!!!), of a movie we\u2019ve seen dozens of iconic adaptations for. \n\nBut then one year I caught it on TV and was just blown away by Jim Carey\u2019s Scrooge. And now it\u2019s become what I consider to be the best Christmas Carol adaptation. It\u2019s neck &amp; neck with Mickeys Christmas Carol(whose only weakness is that it\u2019s not long enough!). Yet it\u2019s Jim Carey who really impresses me. This is not phoned in, not just another role. The man gives it his all and gives what I think is one of his finest performances. \n\nI can\u2019t say it enough. Carey is a stunning here. He plays multiple roles(including 2 of the Ghosts) but his Scrooge is something else. I honestly believe that had this been live action instead of animated, he might\u2019ve received an Oscar nomination. \n\nHis performance in the \u201cGhost of Christmas Past\u201d sequence really gets to me. \u201cI could walk it blind folded\u201d. This is a Scrooge who seems generally amazed &amp; awed by the things he\u2019s seeing. \n\nI think a lot of people get turned off on the movie because it\u2019s done in that Polar Express motion capture style. There\u2019s one or two moments when the technology keeps us at an arms length but generally I find the visuals here to be terrific. Scrooge flying through the city, in the night sky? Great stuff. \n\nSo for those of you out there who maybe got turned off from the motion capture style, i really suggest giving this film another shot. I did and I\u2019m so thankful. It\u2019s just a wonderful Christmas film with a very underrated Jim Carey performance.",
