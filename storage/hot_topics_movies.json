We've worked on other docs like Jazz, The War, Prohibition, The Vietnam War, Hemingway, and more. Ask us anything!\n\nHere are the first 10 minutes of our new docuseries, The American Revolution:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1o8FTXQuzo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1o8FTXQuzo)\n\nAll episodes are now streaming!\n\n&gt;Thirteen American colonies unite in rebellion, win an eight-year war to secure their independence, and establish a new form of government that would inspire democratic movements at home and around the globe. What begins as a political clash between colonists and the British government grows into a bloody struggle that will engage more than two dozen nations and forever change the world.\n\n**Sarah's Bio:**\n\nSarah Botstein has produced some of the most popular and acclaimed documentaries on PBS. She is currently producing and co-directing The American Revolution along with Ken Burns and David Schmidt. Her previous work includes Jazz, The War, Prohibition, The Vietnam War, College Behind Bars, and Hemingway. The U.S. and the Holocaust marked Botstein's debut as a co-director. Botstein works closely with PBS LearningMedia to develop educational materials as part of the Ken Burns Classroom, and she was an original contributor to Ken Burns's UNUM. In addition to The American Revolution, Botstein is working on a three-part series about Lyndon B. Johnson and the Great Society.\n\n**David's Bio:**\n\nDavid Schmidt is the producer and co-director, along with Ken Burns and Sarah Botstein, of The American Revolution, a six-part, 12-hour series premiering on PBS in the fall of 2025. Schmidt began working with Florentine Films as a researcher and apprentice editor for The Roosevelts (2014), while also supervising the documentary\u2019s seven-episode script. His research on The Vietnam War (2017) won him the Jane Mercer Footage Researcher of the Year award, and he also worked closely on that project with writer Geoffrey C. Ward and helped coordinate postproduction. With Burns, Schmidt also produced the two-part biography Benjamin Franklin (2022) for PBS. A graduate of Dartmouth College with a degree in history, Schmidt grew up on the Virginia Peninsula within the Historic Triangle of Jamestown, Williamsburg, and Yorktown\u2014each site only minutes from his childhood home. He spent his summers working in the living history museum in Colonial Williamsburg and on the archaeological dig at Historic Jamestown. Those childhood experiences led him to pursue a career telling American history.\n\nAsk us anything! We'll be back today Wednesday at 3:00 PM ET to answer your questions :)",

I can't think of much that would warrant it. The drinking? The guns? The skeletons? The scene where Jack Sparrow rips off Elizabeth's corset? Like, I'm sure they'll understand it all and have seen much worse outside of school. If you guys agree with her, I could show another movie, it's just that my students would be disappointed.\n\nEdit: I'm half to blame since I asked in English but I should have said I'm from Brazil and this movie's age rating here is 12 and not PG-13 like in the USA. But that's besides the point, because I've been convinced that parents are the fucking worst and could potentially ruin my mental health again lol. Thanks, everyone!",

They felt like meta or parody movies played straight. I'm also surprised how many LGBT elements or jokes there were in the movie where they don't seem dated or insulting either. All the actors of the family were so perfectly cast.",

        "content": "People cheering, yelling, leaping out of chairs, throwing their popcorn into the air, etc.. What movie(s) did you all see in theaters that had the most alive audience?\n\nMy answer is probably Avengers: Endgame. I remember that I was called out of school early by my parents to watch the movie the day it came out in theaters, and we didn\u2019t want to get held up by crowds and get good seats. It was insane how reactive the audience was in my theater, it was fun. A good chunk of them simultaneously cried too.\n\nA close second is Deadpool and Wolverine; some simultaneous laughter and gasps, but mainly cheering and clapping at the surprise character entrances. The theater erupted with excited yelling and clapping when Blade and Gambit entered, my friend (who doesn\u2019t really watch Marvel movies) was so lost it was kinda funny lol.",
