Joe Hisaishi's score just soars, it truly is perfect. \n\nIf you have any opportunity to catch this limited showing this weekend - don't miss this. It's a true work of art.",

This one still holds up imo.\n\nIt's no Jaws or Jurassic Park (This and Congo were movies based on novels by Michael Crichton) but still entertaining in its own right notably it's camp factor and the brutality we see at times. Kinda surprised they got away with a PG rating tbh.",

        "content": "This movie is perfect, to me.\u00a0\n\nThe movie aged well. I love how the actual plot of the birds is very much happening in the background for half of the movie until it is thrust in the forefront. The movie allows you to get to know Melanie, so you understand and care about her. I know some people say the first half drags, but I love how it is its own fun romantic movie before the tragedy sets in. The plot is scary, and I appreciate the feeling of doom. And I like how all the relationships between all the characters have depth.\u00a0\n\nThe dinner scene where they are debating if birds can attack is perfect. The way everyone reacts and plays off everyone else is amazing. I love the contrast of the hysterical mother with the overly logical bird expert.\u00a0\n\nTo be honest I have a huge crush on both leads. Melanie is a strong, wild, and clever woman. Mitch is clever, strong, and a gentleman. Both are insanely attractive. They have serious chemistry and the way they match each other in wit is awesome. It is extremely charming.\u00a0\n\nOverall, 10/10. I watch it every time I get sick, and it always feels like a privilege. I have seen this movie 50+ times.\u00a0",

        "content": "I watched it in 2000. It was about a loser who wrote poetry no one cared about until he wrote an extremely long erotic story that spread around the internet. People had it printed out on dot matrix paper and couldn\u2019t stop reading it.\n\nThe main character liked a girl whose boyfriend made him kiss her ass which he threw up on inside a convenience store.\n\nEventually he had a kid that he\u2019d take to a bar and force to drink whisky.\n\nHonestly I don\u2019t think it was a good movie, but I watched it with a friend who was into watching independent film, and now I can\u2019t get it out of my head.",

        "content": "[Begin Again Headphone Splitter Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBbmdY6nXfw) &lt;- you may see the audio splitter in this video on YouTube\n\nHi! :) I love listening to music and I like the idea of entrepreneurship, and in this movie (Begin Again), they are seen using an audio splitter which has sentimental value to the characters in the movie. I feel an emotional connection to this audio splitter used in the movie, and I also noticed it's probably a high quality pro-audio splitter that was shown. I'd like to purchase one for myself, just for keepsake, and kinda also to use it one day with my wife.\n\nYour help in identifying this audio splitter for me is appreciated :) please have a nice week!",

        "title": "'The Assessment' was really good and it's a shame no one is seeing it",
        "content": "So this just came out last weekend, I had never even heard of it until the week before when I saw a trailer in the theater and thought it looked intriguing, come to find out it made all of $152K this weekend from less than 300 theaters. I'm kind of baffled as to why; this has a really strong visual presentation, three recognizable actors giving very good performances, and a really compelling hook. The only reason I could imagine it not clicking with a bigger audience is because it gets darker than I expected, but I'm shocked that this seemingly just slipped completely under the radar, especially because it seems like the kind of movie this sub will inevitably come across as a 'hidden gem' in the next few years.\n\nThere's definitely an obvious comparison to be made to *Ex Machina* just in the fact that they're both seven day sci-fi experiments set in a futuristic location starring Alicia Vikander, but these are very, very different films beneath the surface. There's a LOT more going on in this film than I expected, and one thing I really have to say is that it feels like the kind of premise that in the hands of another filmmaker could've very easily become one-note or repetitive, but I never felt as though this did. I was really surprised how much depth they managed to give to all three main characters, and how many themes they managed to explore in ways that actually felt meaningful.\n\nThere's definitely some visual elements and ideas that feel as though they were inspired by other films (namely one room in the house that feels very reminiscent of *Blade Runner 2049*), but there's still something really fresh about this that feels like it's coming from a new voice.\n\nIf you have a chance, I'd definitely recommend checking it out. I'm trying to avoid giving anything away because I do feel as though it's best experienced mostly cold, but I also expect it'll only be in theaters for another few days. ",

        "content": "And this is coming from someone who isn't even a Transformers fan. IMO one of the best recent animated films in years alongside The Wild Robot (Ironically both starring robots and releasing the same month).\n\nTrailer did this film such injustice that sadly I was amongst those that fell for its marketing costing me what would have been a great experience at the show.\n\nAfter having heard good things about this film. I decided to give it a shot watching it in the beginning of the new year and then decided on watching it again today and my opinion remains the same as it was first time viewing.\n\nSadly probably not gonna get a sequel since it underperformed but at the very least I hope this spawns a Paramount+ streaming series if not a series of sequels. \n\nOne way or another, assuming it never gets a continuation. One can always look at this as a prequel to any Transformers continuity. Still the post credits has me craving for more and where this could potentially go.\n\nBy no means a flawless movie imo. Bumblebee was amongst them, felt the movie had good enough levity as it was. Felt there was no need for a comic relief. \n\nBut overall I'd give the film 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nBy the way, this might sound harsh but whoever done the marketing and trailer deserves to be fired. Whoever you were, you ended up dooming this amazing movie to fail.\n\nP.S.: I didn't think Brian Tyrian Lee of all people could have pulled off a great Megatron.",
