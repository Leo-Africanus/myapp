I started writing at 18, completed it after years of filming at 22 (with 30 days on the Channel) and at 23 had one of the top indie films in the UK. AMA!\n\n*VINDICATION SWIM* tells the inspiring true story of Mercedes Gleitze, who in 1927 became the first British woman to swim the English Channel. Battling unforgiving seas, societal expectations, and relentless challenges, Mercedes becomes a symbol of resilience. However, her achievement is soon questioned by skeptics, forcing her into a fight for recognition. As Mercedes embarks on a grueling vindication swim, she faces both physical and psychological trials that test her determination. Highlighting the beauty and peril of open water swimming and the obstacles women continue to face in the pursuit of equality, VINDICATION SWIM vividly brings to life the pioneering spirit of Gleitze, who would go on to become a trailblazer for women\u2019s open water swimming around the world.\n\n**Trailer**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0L0g-DBpE8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0L0g-DBpE8)\n\n**Featurette**: [https://vimeo.com/1121810753/592c84c8be](https://vimeo.com/1121810753/592c84c8be)\n\n*VINDICATION SWIM* opens in US theaters (NYC, NJ, CT, LA, San Diego, Santa Barbara, Toronto) beginning October 17; the markets/dates/theaters are below.  On 11/18, it will be available on VOD, all leading digital platforms and DVD.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Bio:** \n\nElliott Hasler is a 24 year old award-winning British filmmaker, best known for his debut feature, Vindication Swim. The historic biopic underwent three years of production with filming taking place in the English Channel itself, followed by a year of post-production at Warner Bros. De Lane Lea Studios. Upon its UK theatrical release Vindication Swim broke into the top 10 at the UK Box Office and played in over 300 cinemas across the UK, Ireland and Malta for a whopping 18 weeks.\n\nHasler\u2019s passion for filmmaking began at a young age, with the production of WII: The Long Road Home. Made whilst at school and completed in 2017 when Hasler was just 16 years old, the film garnered praise from New York film critic Graham Fuller who described the film as \"a miracle achievement for a schoolboy Director.\u201d The film went on to receive a UK, US and European release, earning a spot in the top 50 UK DVD sales and a place on Sky Cinema\u2019s Top 25. In 2024 the film was acquired by Paramount+ for France, Italy and the UK. In 2017 Hasler also founded the UK based independent film company, Relsah Films.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAsk me anything! I'll be back at 4 PM ET today (Tuesday 10/21) to answer any questions.  \n",

        "content": "The entire production history of this movie is incredibly bizarre so it\u2019s forgivable if people have misconceptions but I can\u2019t find a reliable source that the movie had an \u201calternate ending\u201d or \u201coriginal ending\u201d of Derek shaving his head again in the mirror. The theatrical cut, workprint, and screenplay all follow the same beats. The screenplay by David McKenna ends with something I was surprised by: an incredibly melodramatic, overwritten scene where Sweeney (the principal played by Avery Brooks) talks Derek out of going after the killers before they join the mother and sister in mourning. It\u2019s ambiguous, but so is the actual ending only with no need for dialogue. The workprint version of the film is available online and has the same ending as the theatrical albeit with a couple gruesome shots of violence. I can\u2019t find anything about any version of the movie or the script with a \u201cDerek shaves his head\u201d scene nor can I find statements by the cast or crew verifying this. I suspect it\u2019s one of a few movie myths which originate from IMDB trivia submissions which have been sitting there for decades. (\u201cDarren Aronofsky owns the rights to Perfect Blue\u201d is laughably false and not even plausible but people keep repeating it)",

I can see my open bathroom door from where I\u2019m sitting, and that quickly had to close. \n\nI think my biggest fear is being the victim of a home invasion, and I think that was brought up very quickly from this film. \n\nCurious though, are the sequels worth it?

        "content": "The Movie itself is pretty good. Not without some issues, but I really appreciate this thing swinging for the fences. One of the most legitimately beautiful films I've seen in some time with some strange editing choices that can't all be easily explained away as stylistic.\n\nIt's divisive for a reason.\n\nThat said... the ending should be one of the least controversial aspects of the film and online criticisms in spaces like this have me wondering if my whole face should be wrapped in a strait jacket.\n\nVAGUE SPOILERS\n\nIf you didn't know that there's supposed to be a follow up film... *maybe* I could understand having pure tonal whiplash. But even then... it's clear the Power Rangers montage wasn't the ending. This was more of a post-credits/epilogue scene further expanding the world.\n\nBut even in the context of the film alone; it earns this supposedly hysterical idea. It's evident from the film itself that there are disperse communities in this post-apocalyptic UK and segregation would engender sociological differences in how they adapt to this hostile world.\n\nThis is Mad Max, post-apocalyptic, sci-fi world-building 101.\n\nThis particular band of roving, Sentai-simulating crazies isn't any more outlandish than an isolated doctor making a tower of babel out of human skulls.\n\nFinding the tone off-putting is one thing (it would likely have worked better as a post-credits scene overall) but I've seen many occasions of people stating that the scene put them off the film and the sequel entirely, which I find to be *completely* mental, personally.\n\nThere are other aspects of the film that I find to be *far* more outlandish than the ending (\"*the magic of the placenta*\"???).\n\nBut maybe it's just me.\n\nDownvote away.\n\n\\*edit\\*\n\nI honestly thought this would just be downvoted and forgotten about in minutes. Or even more likely - closed.\n\nReddit is so random.\n\nMight as well plug some shit, if that's okay?\n\n[If you care about health and fitness please sub to the Youtube channel!](https://youtu.be/aWERcKIhHow?si=uZaHmB0gI4ctTa4n)\n\nAlso, follow on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/theoriginalkye/?hl=en)!\n\nFinally, I do online training!

        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/nf8pix4l0cwf1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbbc0038d1a7fb761edb8eb4e9e0c089377a8f7c\n\nAfter a very poor year, Blumhouse bounced back with ***Black Phone 2***, which managed to open above the original title. And in the process, ***Tron: Ares*** had a very ugly second weekend drop. The other wide release, Lionsgate's ***Good Fortune***, had very poor luck with an underwhelming debut, while the wide expansion of Amazon MGM's ***After the Hunt*** flopped.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $60.3 million this weekend. That's slightly down from last year, when ***Smile 2*** topped the box office.\n\nDebuting at #1, Universal/Blumhouse's ***Black Phone 2*** earned a damn great $27.3 million in 3,411 theaters. That's above the original's $23.6 million, and marks Blumhouse's highest debut since ***Five Nights at Freddy's*** ($80 million). Yes, it's been some rough two years for the company. It's also above last year's ***Smile 2*** ($23 million), which opened on this exact same date.\n\nThe fact that it could open higher than the original is a very encouraging sign, considering sequels often tend to drop off from the original. While there were concerns over whether the film really warranted a sequel, props to director Scott Derrickson for pulling off a very interesting angle: the Grabber is back, and now he went the Freddy Krueger route of chasing his victims in his dreams. While that felt derivative from that franchise, it was solid enough to justify its existence. And solid reviews (72% on RT) definitely helped.\n\nAccording to Universal, 53% of the audience was male, and 53% was 25 and over. The film was very popular with Hispanic audiences, representing 39% of the weekend's gross. They gave it a \"B\" on CinemaScore; while this is below the original's \"B+\", it's still a solid score for a horror film. With very light horror competition, this is gonna be the main attraction for horror fans this month. It's unlikely it can match the original's gross ($90 million), as that film had stronger-than-usual legs for horror thanks to very strong word of mouth. But at the very least, ***Black Phone 2*** should have enough gas to hit $70 million domestically.\n\nIn second place, Disney's ***Tron: Ares*** earned $11.1 million. That's a very steep 67% drop, worse than ***Legacy***'s 56.5% drop. With such a soft debut, the film just failed to attract interest outside the most diehard fans of the franchise. Through 10 days, the film has earned a meager $54.5 million, and it will finish with just around $75 million domestically at this rate.\n\nIn third place, Lionsgate's ***Good Fortune*** opened with an underwhelming $6.1 million in 2,990 theaters. That's a very mediocre debut, especially considering that it had Keanu Reeves, Seth Rogen, and Aziz Ansari (its writer and director) attached.\n\nGiven its $30 million budget, this is a disappointing result. But it also shows the challenges of opening an original comedy in theaters; ***One of Them Days*** remains the only original comedy to hit $50 million domestically. It's a very complicated market, and unfortunately, comedies are often the most affected. Even with its intriguing combination (angels on Earth and body-swapping), perhaps the audience wasn't interested in seeing Keanu Reeves in a comedy role. Even with good reviews (78% on RT), it just wasn't enough.\n\nAccording to Lionsgate, 53% of the audience was male. It had almost no appeal for young audiences; a colossal 81% of the audience was 25 and over. They gave it an okay \"B+\" on CinemaScore, and it could hold well over the next few weeks. But right now, it'd be a surprise if it made it to $25 million domestically.\n\nWB's ***One Battle After Another*** eased 43%, adding $3.8 million this week. The film's domestic total stands at $61.7 million so far.\n\nIn fifth place, Paramount's ***Roofman*** added $3.7 million this weekend. That's a rough 54% drop, indicating that word of mouth might not be quite strong with this title. Through 10 days, the film has earned $15.5 million, and it will now finish with less than $25 million domestically.\n\nIn sixth place, Angel Studios' ***Truth &amp; Treason*** debuted with a weak $2.6 million in 2,106 theaters. Even with an \"A\" on CinemaScore, it's unlikely it will last long in theaters.\n\n***Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie*** dropped 49% for a $1.7 million weekend. The film has earned $30 million, and it should finish with around $35 million domestically.\n\n***The Conjuring: Last Rites*** dropped 49%, grossing $1.6 million. That takes its domestic total to $175.4 million.\n\nIn ninth place, Amazon MGM's release of Luca Guadagnino's ***After the Hunt*** flopped with just $1.5 million in 1,238 theaters. This is Julia Roberts' worst ever debut in wide release, and it wasn't even in Guadagnino's top 3 wide debuts.\n\nThis result is not surprising. The film was positioned as a big Oscar player, but all that buzz died when it premiered in Venice. Adult dramas require critical acclaim to stand a chance, and ***After the Hunt*** was a rare Guadagnino misfire: it's sitting at a very bad 39% on RT. As such, Amazon MGM slowed down its marketing tactic. Couple all that, along with a very delicate subject matter (sexual assault), and the audience was just very limited. And with an awful \"C\u2013\" on CinemaScore, this is going to fall quickly over the next weeks.\n\nRounding out the Top 10 was Sony's ***Soul on Fire***. Despite strong word of mouth, it dropped 53% for a $1.3 million weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $5.5 million.\n\nNeon released the Palme d'Or winner, Jafar Panahi's ***It Was Just an Accident***, in 3 theaters. It earned $68,294, which is a fine $22,765 per-theater average (although that's just the 18th best of the year). As a point of reference, last year's Palme d'Or winner ***Anora*** averaged $91,750 in its first weekend. It will continue expanding over the next few weeks.\n\nSony Pictures Classics also released Richard Linklater's ***Blue Moon*** in 5 theaters. It debuted with $66,000, which is an unremarkable $13,200 per-theater average. It will expand next week to 500 theaters.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Black Phone 2*** debuted with $15.5 million overseas, for a $42.8 million worldwide debut. Its biggest market was Mexico (the biggest OS market for the original), where it opened with a strong $4.3 million. The other markets were the UK ($1.5M), Brazil ($1.2M), Australia ($908K) and France ($569K). It still has some big markets left to open, so this should have a very strong run all the way through Halloween.\n\nFurther embarrassing itself was ***Tron: Ares***. Despite keeping all IMAX and PLF screens, the film dropped by 54% for $14.1 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to a very poor $103.1 million after just 2 weeks. It opened in China, where it flopped with just $2.8 million. Its biggest markets are Mexico ($4.9M), the UK ($4.3M), France ($3.3M), China ($2.8M) and Germany ($2.7M). With very few markets left, it's clear that the film will struggle to hit $170 million. Which means its worldwide total will be below ***Legacy***'s domestic total ($172 million). Deadline is already reporting that due to its high costs, the film will lose over $130 million. Maybe this is truly the end of the franchise?\n\n***One Battle After Another*** added $11.8 million, allowing it to cross the $100 million milestone overseas, and $162.3 million worldwide. The best markets are the UK ($13M), France ($10.1M), Germany ($7.7M), Italy ($5.2M) and Australia ($4.6M). \n\n***Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie*** added $6.8 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $58.7 million. It had very good debuts in the UK ($2.3M) and Spain ($1M). Only Japan is left, but that's until March.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*The Roses* | Aug/29 | Searchlight | $6,265,264 | $15,298,844 | $51,137,748 | $30M\n\n- Searchlight's ***The Roses*** has closed with a weak $15 million domestically and $51 million worldwide, failing to recoup its budget. For reference, the original ***War of the Roses*** made $86 million domestically and $160 million worldwide back in 1989. Turns out people just weren't interested in going back to the Roses.\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nWe've got a lot of wide releases, and it's up in the air if any will take the #1 spot away from ***Black Phone 2***.\n\nThe first is 20th Century Studios' ***Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere***, which stars Jeremy Allen White as the Boss during the making of his album *Nebraska*. Music biopics have been a gold mine at the box office (well, mostly), so it was inevitable that Bruce Springsteen would get his own biopic. Even if the reviews (66% on RT) do not exactly paint it as a great film itself.\n\nThe other is Paramount's ***Regretting You***, based on the novel by Colleen Hoover. The novel isn't as popular as ***It Ends with Us***, but it doesn't really need that to become a success. Without many romance options in the market, this could be a main attraction for women and couples.\n\nSony is also launching ***Chainsaw Man \u2013 The Movie: Reze Arc*** in many big markets. The film has already earned $68 million overseas, most of which came from Japan. We're coming off the massive success of ***Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba \u2013 The Movie: Infinity Castle***, but don't expect this to get anywhere close to those numbers. \n\nNeon is also releasing Chris Stuckmann's directorial debut ***Shelby Oaks*** in wide release. Announced back in 2021, the film became the most-funded horror film project on Kickstarter, allowing it to finally begin production. It has already premiered in festivals and getting some good reviews (83% on RT), and even got Mike Flanagan attached as executive producer. Even Neon is confident enough in the film, as they agreed to double the budget to increase the violence and gore and refine the film. So get ready to get Stuckmannized.\n\nAnd finally, Focus Features is releasing Yorgos Lanthimos' ***Bugonia*** in limited release, ahead of a wide expansion the following week. It stars Emma Stone, Jesse Plemons, Aidan Delbis, Stavros Halkias, and Alicia Silverstone, and follows two young men who kidnap a powerful CEO, suspecting that she is secretly an alien who wants to destroy Earth. It has premiered in so many festivals (just go look at the Wikipedia page, it's insane) and reviews are pretty great so far (91% on RT). With some Oscar buzz on the horizon, this should easily score one of the year's biggest per-theater averages.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",
