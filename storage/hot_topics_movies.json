        "content": "Frank is only an assoiciate in the mob, a trusted and clealry special associate, but that's all he'd ever be. This is a far more common position than the guys Scorsese has shown in prior mob movies, and Frank's life reflects that. He doesn't have a sugar bowl full of coke in his bedroom, he doesn't own a yacht, his quality of life only marginally improves once he's killing and enforcing for a living. \n\nInstead of Frank's 'protectiveness' for his family being deified in a heroic scene where he beats up the guy who attacked his girlfriend, instead he drags his daughter down to the store so she gets a good look at Frank breaking a guys hand just because he pushed a girl acting up. And of course he can hardly understand why his daughters want nothing to do with him as an old man, it's not just for killing Jimmy Hoffa as they suspect/knew he did, it's because as kids they could never tell him about a teacher who was being unfair or a bully because he'd probably just make them watch as he murdere them. The insane violence that's a part of his career doesn't make him seem strong to his kids, he looks scary and dangerous because he is.\n\nAnd in the end what does his loyalty get him? Does he get what Vito Corleone got, dying peacefully at a ripe age surrounded by family and friends? No, he dies alone and forgotten because he murdered his friend for his boss, and he won't even tell his friend's kids what he did with the body even though there's nobody left to know he snitched. Frank gets a long lonely death because he was too shortsighted and ignorant to stay away from organized crime for his family's sake.",

It's funny without being cringe. The violence, gore, and fighting it filmed expertly. The dialogue and acting is great. The score is SUPERB. Cinematography and editing is beautifully handled. Every character has something to do. I can't recommend it enough and it's now in the yearly Xmas rotation for sure.\n\nIf you like dark comedy action Xmas movies, do yourself a favour!",

        "title": "My Top Rated Picks from 1113 Movies Watched between 2019 and 2024.",
        "content": "I love movies and data, which is I started tracking every movie that I watched as a new years resolution on January 1st, 2019. \n\nI rated each movie based on how entertaining it was in context of the genre(s) it was in. Then, I recorded the IMDB scores of each film after I had given my own score, and calculate a difference between my score and the IMDB score.\n\nSome movies I watched in movie theaters, a lot I watched on Netflix, or Peacock, Hulu, Amazon, Paramount, YouTube (free with ads), and other streaming services. Before the pandemic, I used to go to the movie theater at least once a week. But now, I go about once a month, at most. \n\nIn total, I watched 1,113 movies. Looking at the number of movies per year, On average, I watched 185 movies per year. This comes out to about 15 movies per month, or about 1 movies every other day. There is an upward trend during the first two years of the pandemic.\n\n[This graph shows movies viewed per year](https://imgur.com/AOX7GKp).\n\n**The average rating rating** that I gave to the movies that I watched was **6.76 / 10** (with a standard deviation of 1.6). The median rating was 7/10, and the mode rating was 7.5. On average, my ratings were 0.26/10 higher rating than IMDB ratings.\n\nA frequency table of my movie ratings is provided below:\n\nMy Rating | Frequency| Percent\n---|---|----\n2 | 6 | 0.54\n2.5 | 6 | 0.54\n3 | 27 | 2.43\n3.5 | 15 | 1.35\n4 | 44 | 3.96\n4.5 | 34 | 3.06\n5 | 83 | 7.47\n5.5 | 36 | 3.24\n6 | 107 | 9.63\n6.5 | 119 | 10.71\n7 | 163 | 14.67\n7.5 | 167 | 15.03\n8 | 116 | 10.44\n8.5 | 93 | 8.37\n9 | 64 | 5.76\n9.5 | 20 | 1.8\n10 | 11 | 0.99\n\n[You can also view a histogram graph showing my ratings of movies over the past six years here:](https://imgur.com/NGmOtgg)\n\nBelow are **the movies that I have rated either a 10/10, or a 9.5 /10**. *Keep in mind that these are from movies that I have seen in the last six years*, and there are many great movies that I have watched before 2019 which I have not watched again, which is why they may not be in my top rated list. \n\nTitle | Release Year | Genre | My Rating\n-------|--|----|--\nChildren of Men | 2006 | drama / sci-fi | 10\nFight Club | 1999 | Action / Thriller | 10\nGone Girl | 2014 | Thriller / Mystery | 10\nInterstellar | 2014 | sci-fi / Adventure | 10\nOffice Space | 1999 | Comedy | 10\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring | 2001 | Fantasy / Adventure | 10\nThe Matrix | 1999 | Action / Sci-fi | 10\nThe Truman Show | 1998 | drama / comedy / sci-fi | 10\nA Night\u2019s Tale | 2001 | Adventure / comedy | 9.5\nA.I.

I have seen many more films made per year the closer the year is to the present. So, for most years before 1976, I only watched one film from that year, if not none at all. At first, I thought to only include years in which I have seen at least five films (anything from 1977 or more recent), but I also thought it might be informative to share my ratings for some great older movies that I had discovered for myself. Therefore, I have excluded any movies from earlier years which were rated less than 6/10.\n\nTitle | Release Year | Genre | My Rating\n-------|--|----|--\nThe Life of Emile Zola | 1937 | drama | 8.5\nBambi | 1942 | animated | 8.5\nThe Man From Planet X | 1951 | sci-fi | 7\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers | 1956 | Horror/Sci-fi | 8.5\nSpartacus | 1960 | epic / historical / war / romance / drama | 9\nCleopatra | 1963 | epic / historical / war / romance | 8.5\nFrom Russia with Love | 1964 | Action/Thriller | 5\nThe Good, The Bad And The Ugly | 1966 | Western | 8.5\nRosemary's Baby | 1968 | Horror/Mystery | 9\nCarry On Abroad | 1972 | comedy | 6.5\nThe Conversation | 1974 | spy / thriller / mystery | 7\nDog Day Afternoon | 1975 | drama / crime / thriller | 8.5\nThe Day of the Locust | 1975 | drama | 8.5\nTaxi Driver | 1976 | Crime Noir | 9\nThe Island of Dr. Moreau | 1977 | Horror / Sci-fi | 8\nGreece | 1978 | musical / animated | 8.5\nAlien | 1979 | sci-fi / horror | 9\nRaging Bull | 1980 | Sport Action | 8.5\nRaiders of the Lost Ark | 1981 | Adventure Action | 9\nE.T. the Extra Terrestrial | 1982 | Family/Sci-fi | 8.5\nVacation | 1983 | Comedy/Adventure | 9\nThe Terminator | 1984 | Action/Sci-fi | 9\nFandango | 1985 | comedy | 7.5\nAliens | 1986 | Horror/Action | 9\nFull Metal Jacket | 1987 | War/Action | 9\nDie Hard | 1988 | Action Thriller | 9\nBeetlejuice | 1988 | Horror / Comedy | 9\nHoney I Shrunk the Kids | 1989 | comedy | 8\nHome Alone | 1990 | comedy | 9.5\nLife Stinks | 1991 | Rom Com | 8.5\nHook | 1991 | family / comedy | 8.5\nHome Alone 2: Lost in New York | 1992 | Family/Comedy | 9.5\nAdams Family Values | 1993 | comedy | 9\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas | 1993 | musical / animated | 9\nDumb and Dumber | 1994 | comedy | 9\nThe Mask | 1994 | comedy / fantasy | 9\nCasino | 1995 | Crime/Drama | 9.5\nThe Cable Guy | 1996 | Comedy Thriller | 8.5\nMars Attacks! | 1996 | Comedy/Sci-fi | 8.5\nMission: Impossible | 1996 | action / spy | 8.5\nContact | 1997 | Sci-fi / drama | 9.5\nThe Fifth Element | 1997 | sci-fi | 9.5\nThe Truman Show | 1998 | Comedy/Sci-fi | 10\nThe Matrix | 1999 | Action / Sci-fi | 10\nOffice Space | 1999 | Comedy/Dark comedy | 10\nFight Club | 1999 | Action/Thriller | 10\nMe, Myself &amp; Irene | 2000 | Comedy Drama | 9\nAmerican Psycho | 2000 | Horror Comedy | 9\nRequiem for a Dream | 2000 | Horror/Drama | 9\nReturn to Me | 2000 | Romance | 9\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring | 2001 | Fantasy/Adventure | 10\nMinority Report | 2002 | Sci-fi/Action | 9.5\nThe Sum of All Fears | 2002 | Thriller | 9.5\nSpider Man | 2002 | super hero | 9.5\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King | 2003 | Adventure/Fantasy | 9\nThe Motorcycle Diaries | 2004 | drama | 9\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy | 2005 | Comedy/Sci-fi | 9\nChildren of Men | 2006 | Thriller / Action | 10\nI am Legend (Alt ending) | 2007 | Sci-fi / drama | 9\nWall-E | 2008 | Animation / sci-fi | 9\nThe Dark Knight | 2008 | Action/Crime | 9\nThe Hangover | 2009 | Comedy | 8.5\nThe Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus | 2009 | Fantasy | 8.5\nThe Ghost Writer | 2010 | Thriller/Mystery | 8.5\nMission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol | 2011 | action / spy | 8.5\nJack Reacher | 2012 | Action / Thriller | 9\nInequality for All | 2013 | Documentary | 9.5\nGone Girl | 2014 | Thriller / Mystery | 10\nInterstellar | 2014 | sci-fi | 10\nInside Out | 2015 | animated | 9\nCaptain Fantastic | 2016 | Comedy/Adventure | 9\nThe Dawn Wall | 2017 | Documentary / Sport | 9.5\nWill you be my neighbor | 2018 | Documentary | 9.5\nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood | 2019 | Comedy/Western | 9.5\nThe Empty Man | 2020 | horror | 9\nDune | 2021 | Sci-fi | 9.5\nSpider Man: No Way Home | 2021 | action / comic | 9.5\nTop Gun: Maverick | 2022 | action / drama | 9\nMission Impossible 7 | 2023 | Action | 9\nOppenheimer | 2023 | drama biopic | 9\nBuy Now: The Shopping Conspiracy | 2024 | documentary | 8.5\n\nSince my ratings are based on a scale from 1 to 10, in context of the genre they are in, I also wanted to present the **top films from each genre**. The problem is that most films fall under more than once genre. Therefore, I have somewhat subjectively included a list of the various combinations of genres that I found most common in my data. \n\nTitle | Release Year | Genre | My Rating\n-------|--|----|--\nThe Matrix | 1999 | Action / Sci-fi | 10\nA Night\u2019s Tale | 2001 | Adventure / comedy | 9.5\nOffice Space | 1999 | Comedy / Dark comedy | 10\nInequality for All | 2013 | Documentary | 9.5\nWill you be my neighbor | 2018 | Documentary | 9.5\nThe Dawn Wall | 2017 | Documentary / Sport | 9.5\nThe Truman Show | 1998 | Drama / comedy / sci-fi | 10\nChildren of Men | 2006 | Drama / sci-fi | 10\nSpartacus | 1960 | Epic / historical / war / romance / drama | 9\nLOTR: FOTR, EE | 2001 | Fantasy / action | 9.5\nThe Empty Man | 2020 | Horror | 9\nAmerican Psycho | 2000 | Horror / Comedy | 9\nBeetlejuice | 1988 | Horror / Comedy | 9\nReturn to Me | 2000 | Romance | 9\nMarriage Story | 2019 | Romance / Comedy / Drama | 9\nAlien | 1979 | Sci-fi / Horror | 9\nDonnie Darko | 2001 | Sci-fi / Thriller | 9\nGone Girl | 2014 | Thriller / Mystery | 10\n\nFor the most part, my ratings were relatively close to the IMDB ratings for their movies. But there were some outliers. Therefore, I thought it would be interested to create a short list of the movies that I have the greatest rating difference, either positive or negative. Also note that the IMDB scores may be different today compared to the day that I watched the movie and recorded the score.\n\nThese are the movies with **the most negative score difference**, *with an IMDB score of at least a 7/10*:\n\nTitle | Release Year | Genre | My Rating | IMDB score\n---------|--|----|--|--\nI'll Be Watching | 2023 | horror | 4 | 7.8\nBal-Can-Can | 2005 | comedy | 4 | 7.7\nDogtooth | 2009 | Drama/ Thriller | 4 | 7.2\nA Quiet Place: Part II | 2021 | Horror | 4.5 | 7.2\nJackass Forever | 2022 | comedy | 4.5 | 7.1\n\nFinally, to end on a more positive note, these are the movies I viewed as having **the most positive score difference**.\n\nTitle | Release Year | Genre | My Rating | IMDB score\n---------|--|----|--|--\nDumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd | 2003 | Comedy/Slapstick | 6.5 | 3.5\nThe Hungover Games | 2014 | comedy | 6.5 | 3.5\nFreddy Got Fingered | 2001 | comedy | 7.5 | 4.7\nThe Empty Man | 2020 | horror | 9 | 6.2\nHeartbreak Kid | 2007 | romcom | 8.5 | 5.8\nDear Santa | 2024 | comedy | 8 | 5.3\n\nI was not sure how else I could analyze this data, so if you have any suggestions, I'd like to learn something new. \n\nI hope you find this at least a bit interesting and fun, and might find a movie or two to watch into the new year!",

I remember it being longer, and much better.\n\nJust today I watched the special edition, which is like 30 minutes longer than the theatrical version, but is definitely not the director\u2019s cut I remember.\n\nIn the director\u2019s cut I remember, the aliens are making a bunch of tsunamis to wipe out earth, and then they stop, showing bud the texts he sent to lindsay as a reason why they decided not to go through with it.\n\nI\u2019m wondering now if the one I just watched was just the theatrical version mislabeled as the special edition, because I\u2019m not seeing anything on the internet about there being a difference between the special edition and the director\u2019s cut.\n\nThanks!",

I have loved the game Red Dead Redemption 2 for so long that it was about time i watched a film with some of the same essense. I also love neo-western films like No country for old men, Sicario and Hell or highwater. I tried a google search for films like those, but the first movie that got recommended was \u00abthe quick and the dead\u00bb wich i saw and felt was nothing like the two i mentioned first in terms of pacing, directing, editing and so on. so any tips? Tv shows would be appreciated too! \n\nEdit: cant believe how many did not read the post before writing a comment lol",

        "content": "It really is a rare thing in film. At most, movies might have opening or closing narration, but I cant think of many other movies throughout the history of film that is fully narrated for the length of the film. And even more rare is for the narration to be done by the main character, usually its a disembodied storyteller. Deadpool is the last one I could remember but his narration makes sense as he is made to be a fourth-wall breaker. Even at that he didn't narrate his movies the whole way through.\n\nCan you imagine any modern movie today with full narration in the vein of A Christmas Story? The character pretty much narrating what hos thoughts and actions were at the time that he is reciting this story? \n\nWhat are your favorite movies with narration? ",

        "content": "Tremors is a 1990 action/comedy/horror movie that made Kevin Bacon famous. Okay, he was already famous with the movie Footloose but I hadn't seen that one so for me, it is the movie I most associate with Kevin Bacon.\n\nI seen it so many times I know most of the lines. I was gonna says \"every single line\" but that's obviously an exaggeration. I've yet to meet someone who could say that about any movie. But more than half the time, I can tell you the exact line.\n\nI watched it a lot not cause it's a lesson in masterful filmmaking or deep or anything. I mean it's cheesy, it's dumb, and it's silly. Yet yet it's so funny and entertaining as hell.\n\nHere are some of the lines that get me:\n\nValentine: Who died and made you Einstein?\n\nEarl: Run for it? Running's not a plan! Running's what you do once a plan fails!\n\nWalter: Earl. Here's some swiss cheese and some bullets.\n\nAnd here's one last one:\n\n&gt;Earl: What kind of fuse is that?\n\n&gt;Burt: Cannon fuse.\n\n&gt;Earl: What the hell do you use it for?\n\n&gt;Burt: My cannon.\n\nIf you haven't watched it yet and want a mindless movie during the holidays, you gotta check it out.",
