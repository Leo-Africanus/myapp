It feels like digging through a cinematic time capsule.\n\nWhat are some cool or unexpected films you\u2019ve discovered there? Could be classics, weird experimental stuff, vintage educational films, or just something you didn\u2019t expect to find.",

        "content": "I was quite certain that I was not going to like Taxi Driver and avoided it for a long while. I knew it had to be a good movie, of course, but I was sure many of the things Scorsese is great at weren't going to be up to the level of his later works. \n\nOnce I got to watch it I realize what a masterpiece the movie is on some many aspects. Not only that, but realized it is another of those movies that either invented or highlighted stuff that are still imitated today. \n\nNow, my expectations were low and maybe that why I could appreciate it better, but I still think that I was going to appreciate this masterpiece either way.",

        "content": "Stumbled upon this recently and I have never heard of it. Usually some old movies are vaguely remembered, but I don\u2019t recall ever hearing talk about it either. Really good film, possibly even a great film. The wild thing is it\u2019s entirely set in training camps.\n\nColin\u2019s character was interesting to see and develop; he was still a dick in the end, but for the most of the movie he was tolerable. The supporting cast is good and some notable faces. Enjoyed the grainy visual of it.\n\nCheck it out if you can find it somewhere. Might be in my top 15-20 war films. Recommend it!",

You do have some all-star celebs in this franchise. Different stories but one awesome, charismatic leading man - Benoit Blanc is in for a long, long, epic run!! \n\n2) Smart and socially relevant writing - masterclass in mystery storytelling. Plot is layered but not confusing. Tight and clever. Everything has a purpose. It\u2019s all in the details!\n\n3) Thematic and high visual production - sharp and unique tone with great cinematography. Classic genre turn into modern flair - realistically grounded. \n\n4) Simple and fun! - you don\u2019t need to be stressed throughout the movie and just enjoy the humor and ride all the way. The most rewatched films I\u2019ve had in recent years - and it\u2019s get better every time. \n\nKnives Out 9.5/10\n\nGlass Onion 9/10",

I remember watching it as a kid and being traumatized by the Sam getting shot scene. I rewatched it with my brother recently and it still held up. I think they did an amazing job of making me actually like the characters, I felt really bad for zero and Stanley 4. The plot was good, but I think the character development was great, and I really like the kkb story as well as the curse story.",
