        "content": "Hi /r/movies, we're Matthew Salleh and Rose Tucker, the documentary filmmaking duo behind\n\n\u201cSlice of Life: The American Dream. In Former Pizza Huts.\u201dWe also made \"Barbecue\"\n\n(2017) and \"We Don't Deserve Dogs\" (2020) - Ask us anything!!\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re Matthew Salleh and Rose Tucker, a two-person documentary team originally from\n\nAustralia, now based in the US. Our new documentary film, \u201cSlice of Life: The American\n\nDream. In Former Pizza Huts.\u201d was released online last week after touring the film festival\n\ncircuit the last 6 months.\n\n\n\nFor the film, we captured a portrait of America through businesses that operate out of\n\nthose iconic former Pizza Hut buildings. It\u2019s our third feature documentary \u2013 we previously\n\nmade \u201cBarbecue\u201d (where we journeyed around the world looking at how communities\n\ngather by cooking meat over fire) and \u201cWe Don\u2019t Deserve Dogs\u201d (where we journeyed\n\naround the world looking at the relationship between humans and dogs). You might detect\n\na recurring theme in our films!\n\n\n\nWe do all this as a two-person team \u2013 Matt directs and shoots, Rose produces and does the\n\nsound, we do all the editing, sound mixing and post production out of our one bedroom\n\napartment, and we fund and distribute the films entirely ourselves. We\u2019re also a couple\n\n(going on 19 years \u2013 since this question usually comes up pretty quickly).\n\nWe also readily admit that we work freelance (as corporate video editors) to make this\n\ndream job work. In fact, we were pretty much secretly \u2018working from home\u2019 for the entire\n\nproduction and release of this new film. We try to be very honest and open about how\n\ntough independent filmmaking can be, and are trying to remove the stigma around working\n\nthe second job when Hollywood doesn\u2019t come calling. We\u2019ve seen the highs and lows of\n\nthis biz \u2013 our first feature was sold to Netflix, our second film\u2019s world premiere was\n\ncanceled in the first week of the pandemic...\n\n\n\nAsk us anything! About the new film, about the old films, about independent filmmaking,\n\nabout the grind of corporate video work, about how we got to meet and interview the\n\noriginal 91-year-old founder of Pizza Hut, about lenses and microphones, about anything!\n\nOh, and if you\u2019re interested in seeing the new film, it\u2019s available on Amazon Prime Video\n\nand also direct through our website \u2013 [sliceoflifedoc.com](http://sliceoflifedoc.com) . If you go to the site and click the\n\n\u2018Stream Now\u2019 button, use the code FORMER to see the film for free (or the code PIZZA for\n\n50% off if the other code runs out).\n\n**SYNOPSIS**\n\nA contemporary portrait of America, observed within the walls of former Pizza Hut buildings\n\nacross the country. These nostalgic spaces hold memories of a bygone era, but through\n\nthe power of transformation, they provide something new and special for the communities\n\nthat continue to flow through them.\n\nFrom an LGBTQ+ church in Florida, to a karaoke bar in Texas, to a cannabis dispensary in\n\nrural Colorado, these modern-day portraits are paralleled with the origin story of Pizza Hut -\n\none of America's most iconic brands, and the two brothers who founded the company in\n\nWichita, Kansas in 1958.\n\n**TRAILER**: [https://youtu.be/alql\\_8UgJlI](https://youtu.be/alql_8UgJlI)\n\n**HOW TO WATCH**: the film is available now on Amazon Prime Video and direct via our\n\nwebsite [sliceoflifedoc.com](http://sliceoflifedoc.com)\n\nBack at 3 PM ET to answer your questions!\n\n",

        "content": "Phenomenal movie with a lot of memorable scenes and characters, but the standout is obviously Dementus\n\nEven from a design standpoint, he\u2019s very distinct. A cape made of a parachute, crooked nose, and the teddy bear on his armor. Also a super nasally and abrasive voice. I would say in terms of cruelty, he probably does the most fucked up things of any villain from the last few years, including to his own men\n\nWe know very little about his backstory other than that his family was killed early on in the wasteland, leaving him with only the teddy bear to remember them by. As a result, Dementus commits heinous acts just to feel something, anything. While it gives him an initial rush of adrenaline, we see how he has to do worse and worse things just to feel something, until it\u2019s never enough. In his old age, he\u2019s extra unhinged and obsessed with misery. In his \u201cthere is no hope!\u201d speech, I kind of interpreted Dementus as being upset with the idea of other people finding solace in eachother.\n\nEarlier in the movie, he tries to become a twisted father figure to Furiosa and have her replace the family he lost, and seems genuinely hurt when she hates him (he lacks the self awareness to know she would obviously hate him for killing her mother)",

Somehow, they're able to push the sci-fi envelope and offer up fresh images and ideas the series has yet to see, while also appealing to diehard fans with Easter eggs (keeps your eyes peeled for a pistol in the final act and a franchise-first look at something fans have been dying to see realized since 1987), as well as cheeky teases of a connected universe and potential sequel, too. Before we get anything like that, though, the latter  is set to release the upcoming live-action flick Predator: Badlands, yet another take on the menacingly-mandibled meanies. After Prey, we had faith the series was in good hands. After Predator: Killer of Killers, we don't want anyone else getting their mitts on it.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - Frank Scheck](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/predator-killer-of-killers-review-dan-trachtenbergs-animated-anthology-puts-an-inventive-spin-on-a-durable-franchise-1236247198/)\n\n&gt;Predator: Killer of Killers provides the non-stop action that the diehard fans crave. And no concession has been made to the animated format; the film easily earns its R rating with copious amounts of gruesome violence and bloody gore that should well sate viewers\u2019 bloodthirsty tendencies. The animation takes a bit of getting used to, with its exaggerated, video game-style visuals, but it serves the material well.\n\n[The Guardian - Catherine Bray - 3/5](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jun/05/predator-killer-of-killers-review-animated-anthology-of-arnies-old-antagonists)\n\n&gt;The only problem with this stuff is that you can\u2019t help picturing how much more spectacular it would look in live action. The animation is all perfectly competent but it\u2019s lacking a little something \u2013 that spark of life and ingenuity that can make even flawed animation so fascinating. There\u2019s something quite slick about all this, almost to a fault. Was AI involved? We\u2019ll probably never know, but it\u2019s a problem that the suspicion has got inside the door.\n\n[TheWrap - William Bibbiani](https://www.thewrap.com/predator-killer-of-killers-review-hulu/)\n\n&gt;Dan Trachtenberg and Joshua Wassung\u2019s animated \u201cPredator\u201d sequel takes a while to prove it\u2019s more than just a demo reel of superficial badassery, but when it does, it\u2019s involving and intense. It\u2019s hard not to love at least a couple of these characters, who keep getting screwed over by their own propensity for violence. If you\u2019re so deadly that monsters travel millions of light years just to try to murder you, you might have flown a little too close to the sun. You never see a Predator hunting the attendees at a needlepointing convention, that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.",

        "content": "For me: Clue.\n\nI was too young to watch it in theaters, and I don't remember when exactly I watched it, but I remember watching it on HBO at least eight or ten years after it came out loving it. And I didn't actually know it was based on the board game (I knew the game as \"Cluedo,\" not \"Clue\") until well into the first act when they started introducing everyone's names. But I never talked about it with anyone, and no one I knew ever brought it up. So for a long time I figured it was just one of those movies that only a few people really watched.\n\nBut fast forward 30+ years, and now there are memes from that movie all over the place, and I feel like I can make a Clue reference and safely expect it to be understood (especially online). And I watch YouTube reactors as kind of a guilty pleasure, and I see Clue topping their request polls. Like, where were these people when I was a kid? Lol\n\nSimilarly, there were certain movies around 1999 to 2005 that were more idiosyncratic than popular, e.g. Dark City, A Knight's Tale, the Mummy. I wasn't exactly a kid when these came out, but these were also movies that I didn't think of as being widely popular but which I loved and rewatched fairly often, but now you see so much love for them.",

        "content": "I cried and smiled I think the entire movie. Yeah it was maybe a bit sanguine but idk. I felt like it really addressed the zeitgeist and allowed me to feel some catharsis. It provided commentary on the current moment but provided some hope for the future. I loved seeing all the characters connect, the humanity of everyone. I loved the layers, the timeline, how it made me both think and feel. I kinda have a theory on how dance and music really elevates any TV show or movie and I think this movie (and Sinners actually) proves it. I loved seeing Tom Hiddleston and that female coach and the teacher and the drummer and the grandmother. I loved seeing the grace in the film. I did take an edible and am maybe feeling a lot. But did anyone else connect with this film? It makes me want to go out and dance but I don\u2019t know where I can do that so maybe this discussion will suffice thank you.\n\nEdit: ok I reached the end and I think I\u2019ve reached Nirvana thank you.\n\nEdit2: I loved how it started with technology dying at the beginning and the rest of the movie was about remembering what it means to be human (which is what I liked about Murderbot too - a breath of fresh air).\n\nEdit3: I feel like I understand some Buddhism now. I can be a Bodhisattva. ",
