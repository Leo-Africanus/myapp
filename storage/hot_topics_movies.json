        "content": "There have been a few movies that for one reason or another I really didn't think I'd like so I avoided them only to reluctantly watch them later and be pleasantly surprised at how much I liked them. For example:\n\n- For the longest time I avoided **Tropic Thunder** because it came out around the same time as Pineapple Express and from trailers and initial friends' reactions I feared it was going to have too much of the same kind of dumb comedy, something I normally really dislike. And it's funny because in certain ways that still turned out to be true, but TT just does everytthing - even the dumb stuff - just right!\n\n- I knew it was considered a classic but I wasn't that interested in seeing **Thelma &amp; Louise** honestly for no good reason other than I just didn't think it was going to stand the test of time that well. But, yea, I was very wrong, this is a great movie.\n\n- I normally don't like a lot of 80s horror so I hadn't seen **The Thing** for quite some time. But this is a classic for a very good reason.\n\nWhat are some for you? I'm curious about movies that you really didn't think you'd like, and why, only to be proved wrong.",

It's that ole 'on opposing sides but still respectful' notion. And with just one sentence, you get a whole sense of their relationship and history.\n\nWhat small moments in other films have stuck with you?\n\n(Also, still tickles me every time I watch it that two Brits are playing Americans, while the American plays a Russian).",

        "title": "How many of you liked Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) from \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" (1984)? A misunderstood protagonist or a screeching nuisance?",
        "content": "It might be nostalgia affecting my view. Either way, I always had a soft spot for Willie Scott, because she was a fish out of water and acted accordingly. \n\nCritics sometimes complain about the Mary Sue or the leading lady who turns into GI Jane in just 15 minutes, yet with Willie Scott, the spoiled Cabaret singer who's taken \"hostage\" by Indiana Jones and finds herself falling off planes and made as a sacrifice for a Satanic God, she never changes. She screams, she has temper tantrums, she cries and she is grossed out by the food. \n\nI liked her for it, because it's how most humans would have acted in her place, and I enjoyed Kate Capshaw's attempts at bringing screwball humor as well as showing Willie having a bit of a evolution along the way. \n\nShe's not the smart and adventurous Marion Ravenwood, she's not expected to be. Every romantic interest Indiana Jones had in the original trilogy was different. Willie was, easily, the one leading lady who had the meatiest role since she's onscreen for most of the film. \n\nCan I also say the \"Anything Goes\" number in Cantonese opening number slays the house boots down? You could tell Steven Spielberg could direct a musical if he wanted in 1984.",

        "content": "Hi all. I'm doing a study on film analysis right now. I vaguely remember seeing a theory which states that all movies can be subdivided into several (i think seven?) criteria, and it is essentially a graph which determines the happiness level of the characters at the beginnings, middle, and ending, showing the overall success level as a movie progresses. Can anyone suggest the name of this theory? Thanks in advance\n\n",

The build-up is intriguing, it hints at the whole \u201cturning into a panther via sex\u201d thing without explicitly showing it, and those Giorgio Moroder chords towards the end are god-tier.",
