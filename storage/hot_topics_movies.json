He took a reduced upfront salary of $14 million and made an additional $115 million from the backend deal.  In 2026 inflation-adjusted dollars, this would be around $184 million !!  Dude got PAID.\n\nThe 2nd highest payday was for Tom Cruise in \"Top Gun: Maverick\" where he reportedly made $115 million for that blockbuster film.\n\nKeanu Reeves was paid $138 million for the two Matrix sequels.",

        "content": "Just finished watching Train Dreams, and I have to say, I haven't had a movie affect me like this is a long long time. It really hit home, probably because I grew up in the PNW, and I've had a lifelong interest in the historical logging industry here, but also because the wife and I had our first child, and, well, having a kid makes you put some things into perspective. \n\nIf you haven't seen it, it's definitely worth a watch, but more than being just a solid movie, it's a deeply personal reminder of the complex humanity of all of us. Robert in the film is literally a nobody. He doesn't know how his parents are, he leaves no mark on the world, but the depth of his joys and despairs are only heightened by the sheer mundanity of them. \n\nI noticed this in my own life. The joy of falling in love is paired with the fact that it's actually pretty mundane. It happens to literally billions of people on this planet. And I don't think that lessens it, in fact the fact that so many people experience joys and despairs like Robert does in the film just underscores their emotional impact. \n\nThe movie reminds us that everyone deserves deep empathy, and understanding. A nameless logger in Spokane at the turn on the century, who left no mark on the world, that person on the bus or the train who you've never seen and you'll never see again, or that lone person behind the Reddit account responsible for the comment your reading...each and every one of those people has hopes, dreams, fears, joys, and regrets that are like just as deep and emotionally complex as you do. \n\nAnyway, take a moment to remember the complex life of those strangers on the street, or the commenters on the Internet. Even though we don't know them, just like Robert, they deserve some empathy and understanding too. ",

        "content": "We\u2019ve all had those experiences when you are we\u2019re an hour into a film and still waiting for it to start. But then there are those rare movies where, within the first 20 minutes, you find yourself leaning back, putting your phone away and realizing: \"Oh I\u2019m in good hands here\" or something like that.\n\nFor me it\u2019s that perfect mix of world building and confidence. No clunky dialogue, no forced exposition just pure visual perfect storytelling that sets the tone and makes the stakes clear quickly.\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of opening that makes you realize you\u2019d probably watch another two hours of just those characters existing in that world or hell maybe wish that the movie never ended.\n\nWhat is the one movie that had you 100% sold before the first 20 minutes even ended?\n\n  \n**Edit:** Wow, didn't expect this to blow up like it did! Appreciate everyone jumping in. Reading through the comments, I'm seeing a lot of love for the usual suspects like *Saving Private Ryan* and *Mad Max*,up, etc... but a few lesser talked about ones mentioned in here definitely deserve more credit:\n\n* **28 Weeks Later:** That opening run across the fields is pure anxiety.\n* **Baby Driver:** The \"Harlem Shuffle\" coffee run is basically a masterclass in sync and editing.\n* **The Matrix:** Trinity\u2019s introduction still hits just as hard 25+ years later.\n* **And others**\n\n",

Just a really good cinematography? \n\nAlso it doesn\u2019t have to be an old movie, it can be from any time line !   I was mainly in love with the feeling of loneliness and \u201clost\u201d essence that Lawrence had for a decent amount of the film.  It very unique and was done so well with the world feeling so vast in the film. ",

        "title": "Train Dreams opinions from someone familiar with Northern Idaho",
        "content": "Train Dreams is one of the best movies of the year and is now a nominee for Best Picture at the 98th Oscars.\n\nI spent the summers growing up at my Aunt and Uncle's home in Bonners Ferry, Idaho. They actually made me read Train Dreams in high school! I didn't enjoy it then, but it was cool to recognize the geography.\n\nFast-forward to now, and I've become someone who's big into movies and enjoys the awards season. I heard about Train Dreams (the movie) around this time last year and reread the book in preparation. This time, I sobbed.\n\nEven though they filmed the movie over the mountains in Northeast Washington, they kept the essence of the story intact -- the people. For every unfortunate racist and sexist in Bonners Ferry (something we had to contend with sometimes), there are 3 \"Robert Grainers\" -- lost, lonely people who find more enjoyment interacting with the world around them than they could find from society. We need them as much as we need anyone else, to loosely paraphrase the movie.\n\nI knew my own Robert Granier growing up. He was the kindest, sweetest mountain man I've ever met. He's passed on now, and even if he were here, I don't think he'd even know what Netflix is. Yet, he lives on in me and in this character. That's the power of movies.\n\nAlso, I've seen Bigfoot two times for sure, maybe three. I miss Northern Idaho so much \ud83d\ude2d",

        "content": "I was just watching the new HBO show Knight of the Seven Kingdoms and (Minor Spoilers)\n\nIt got me thinking how much I love Dumb protagonists- meaning, a character who clearly is bent on doing the right thing, but having no idea how to go about it and sort of being clueless in spite of being an unflappable good.\n\nAnother great example is Bruce Willis in Unbreakable. Guy is depressed and experiencing things he can't explain, finally another character has to lay out he may be essentially a Superhero. If no one had told him he probably never would have even figured this out and even when he is told he still has to be told what to do about it. I just love that. He's a GOOD guy whos willing to do anything to be that but just is kinda dumb. There's a sheer straight forward earnestness to them and despite lack of brains a charm.\n\nSamwise is probably a good example as well. Kinda even the Raimi spiderman a little.Anyway it's a trait I love seeing in film.\n\nAny other great examples anyone can think of?",

        "content": "Spoiler warning, I honestly don't reccomend reading my post if you haven't seen this film; for all the same reasons that explaining a joke no longer makes it as funny, or knowing the punchline preemptively does.  \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThe ending of this movie had me cackling for a good 15 minutes. It's been days since I saw it, and it still makes me smirk to think about the amount of effort and care that went into the punchline. It was like the film equivalent of a long Norm MacDonald joke.  \n\nThe entire time. Hidden beneath the phenomenal performances from Jesse Plemmons and Emma Stone that had me on the edge of my seat **fully** convinced that I was watching a bonafide  psychological thriller not unlike many other movies I have seen in the past; 10 Cloverfield Lane came to mind as an influence and I was constantly comparing Goodman's performance to Plemmons. I was expecting another run of the mill intricate game of cat and mouse between a raving lunatic and their innocent captured prey. Some of the scenes were so visceral and intense that I completely forgot the film I had chosen was classified as 'black comedy'.  \n\nLike a lot of you, it wasn't until very near the end of the movie when the full scope of the trick that had been played on the audience (and myself) became apparent. All at once, it dawned on me that this masterpiece of a film was the comedy equivalent of the sixth sense. The entire time, in retrospect, it is blatantly and unabashedly a comedy. The police officer continuously and intentionally bringing up his past **molesting** Teddy, the 'would be heroes' chemically castrating themselves, the 'over the top' gore in some of the scenes, the bumbling and inept abduction scene, the comically bad special effects when Teddy's vest explodes, even the font that the movie uses is foreshadowing the end...the movie was screaming absurdities from the rooftop the entire time - it's entire premise is hilarious at its surface level, but the actors trick you and push their performances so far it blinds you to the fact that a very very funny story is unfolding before your eyes.  \n\nI can't wait for my second watch through, I'll enjoy looking for all the other extremely blatant clues that I ignored or missed. It's so rare that a movie has the kind of rewatch value that Bugonia does and the fact I get to enjoy the ride twice in completely different ways really speaks to how well the vision of the film was executed.  \n\nBravo.",

The dialogue alone could carry the movie, but the direction and pacing turn it into something way up there!! \nHugh Grant did a really great performance in this film!!",
