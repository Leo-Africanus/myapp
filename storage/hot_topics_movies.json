        "content": "Hello,\n\nMy daughter (11f) and her friend (11f) are having a sleepover. They want to watch a movie to make them cry. So far we have tried A walk to Remember, Bridge to Terebithia, Titantic, the notebook, Marley and Me. No tears or anything. Just laughter. I think these girls have no souls. Any suggestions? We have to keep it pg-13 and below. Thanks! \nEdit for movies I forgot she watched at a different time:\n\n\nForgot they have seen most Disney movies prior- not Fox and the hound so will tell them that. \n\nHave also watched My girl with no tears \n\n\nSecond update: they have decided on Old Yeller. I will let you know. Also I made a mistake and my daughter\u2019s friend cried at the end of A wall to Remember- so it\u2019s just my daughter who has problems. \n\nThird update: they tried old Yeller but couldn\u2019t get into it. Her friend hasn\u2019t seen My girl and my daughter saw it a while ago so they are giving that a shot. \n\nWe watched the preview to Stepmom on Amazon and it wasn\u2019t a real trailer so I couldn\u2019t sell it. \n\nShe also got mad at me because I rounded her up to 11 and she is actually 10.8 years old and wants accurate recommendations based on her correct age. \n\n4th update. They finished my girl. Her friend cried. My daughter said she just couldn\u2019t cry  she wanted to share this picture for all the my girl fans [https://imgur.com/a/dwobAmV](https://imgur.com/a/dwobAmV). Her friend is still crying from it and started crying when she read the speech. So there is hope for her. \n\nI just want to say my daughter has a dark sense of humor and loves to laugh but she is the sweetest kid. She is the first to offer help. Shes very kind and sweet. She helps her teacher during lunch. She also has a strong moral compass and compassion to animals and people. She stands up for her friends and her beliefs and is just a generally a great kid. I\u2019m sure in a few years so will be a crier like me. Thank you all for your suggestions. We will make our way through a lot of these. \n\nI think tomorrow we will do a Schindler\u2019s list family movie night. My husband is thrilled..\n\nI think we will have to do grave of the fireflies tomorrow as well. Lots of suggestions. I haven\u2019t heard of it. ",

McQueen says, \u201cJay loves Sharon. That's what's up. And he knows, as sure as God made little green apples, that one of these days that Polish prick's [Roman Polanski] gonna fuck things up and when he does, Jay's gonna be there.\u201d \n\nI may be reading into this a little much (or maybe this was obvious) but I just realized that this quote may have more importance than I had initially thought. At the end of the movie, we know that Sharon Tate ultimately survives the Manson murders in contrast to what actually happened. Is it possible that this quote from Steve McQueen may have been Tarantino\u2019s thoughts for how Polanski and Tate\u2019s marriage would have worked out if she had survived? Especially since Polanski has turned out to be an extremely awful person, this may have been the thing that McQueen was pointing to when he said that Polanski\u2019s going to fuck things up one day. \n\nLet me know your thoughts.",

Or what are his best short films in your opinion?\n\nThanks for listening and for your answers!",

        "content": "The 90s especially liked using that storyline in kids sports movies, in no small part thanks to the success of \"The Mighty Ducks.\" But \"The Sandlot\" has none of that, as the whole point of the titular baseball field is that the gang of friends who use it have an endless game that they play themselves with no organization save their own. There is no championship to win, it's just kids having fun. And while there is the subplot with the snobby Little League team midway through the film, it's just one of several episodes in the film's storyline and the film gleefully subverts the \"championship game\" by having it be a completely one-sided affair where the gang crushes the Little Leaguers (in no small part due to Ham's trash talking behind the plate). It's another way \"The Sandlot\" is such an endearing classic. Championship games are not nearly as important as saving the Baby Ruth ball from the Beast.",

        "content": "It's also on Tubi. \n\nCannon was this amazing low budget independent film company 70s through the 90s. There's 2 docs on them called *Electric Boogaloo: The Wild, Untold Story of Cannon Films* and *The Go-Go Boys: The Inside Story of Cannon Films*.\n\nThey made probably 600-700 movies... a few oscar nominated ones like Runaway Train... but a lot of fun or bad cheezy action exploitation films like the Charles Bronson ones in the 80s, Chuck Norris movies... and some amazing cheezy musicals like Breakin 2 electric boogaloo and the infamous The Apple\n\nso last night I was able to go see one of the lesser later ones (they released didn't produce) as they were winding down their run...  called Crack House from 1989. From the director of Death Spa.\n\nAbsolutely hilarious. \n\nIt's about a little high school white girl living in the hood that's been destroyed by gangs and drugs, dating an ex gang member and she's gonna be a designer and get out of there.  \n\nthen the spiral begins... \u201coh My boyfriend is now in jail. my drunk mom doesn\u2019t care.  I\u2019m gonna start dating the high school drug dealer.   \n  \nOh let me try some crack now I need more crack. I'm hooked on crack.   \n  \noh my grades have fallen and my guidance counselor is the drug supplier and now I have to strip for him to get a fix.   \n  \noh I\u2019m kidnapped by the Big drug kingpin and I\u2019m now his slave sex whore. What has happened to my life? \u201c  \n  \nit's like an exploitation after school special, Also part of the fun is the older experienced cast with Richard Roundtree and Jim Brown as the cop and drug kingpin.

        "content": "I feel like there are probably more WW2 Nazi movies than any other genre. by comparison I can only think of may be 5 or 6 about the Japanese .\n\nWhy such the disparity?\n\nFor one it's a bit disingenuous and disrespectful to portray WW2 as a purely European conflict.  And from a strictly entertainment standpoint, you could write up a million different scripts that would put Private Ryan to shame.\n\nAlso, the few movies I have seen about Japanese in WW2 tend to portray them as noble warriors when in reality they were every bit as evil and diabolical as the Nazis, and committed some of the worst atrocities of the last hundred years.  \n\nTheir treatment of POWs was also probably the worst fates suffered during any US military war. They would literally mass execute captured soldiers and sailors, often by beheading....\n\nWhy is there no Inglorious Bastards Japanese version to date?",

        "title": "I watched an obscure movie from the 70s called 'The Noah' that I found on Vimeo",
        "content": "So I had made a post a few weeks ago looking for films that fit into a weird sub genre that I wasn't exactly sure how to identify, but basically films about apocalyptic events that take place away from the core of the action; as in, a traditional apocalypse movie would be something like *The Day After Tomorrow*, whereas I was more interested in things like *Invasion of the Body Snatchers*. *Knock at the Cabin* would also be a more recent example of this.\n\nSomeone mentioned *The Noah* from 1975, and I have no idea how they knew about it, because even with no view count, the Vimeo post has exactly three likes and one comment. It has just over 400 ratings on IMDb, and was reportedly made for just $200,000. Word to the wise, if you find a weird 70s movie and the budget is less than half a million, chances are you're gonna get some good shit. \n\nBasically the entire film is Robert Strauss, a soldier who survived a war we know nothing about, other than that everyone outside this island is dead. The whole film is just about him inventing these imaginary people in his head, represented by voices he responds to but are never visually shown. He eventually grows his imaginary world, which we hear but never see, creating a really interesting experience that wasn't quite like anything I've seen before.\n\nI won't give away the entire thing, because it really was a pretty memorable experience, but it was just nice to see something so different and out of the box. Curious if anyone's ever come across this one.",
