        "content": "Hi! I\u2019m Evan Ari Kelman, a filmmaker and writer. Barron\u2019s Cove is my feature debut, a new indie crime thriller starring Garrett Hedlund, Brittany Snow, Christian Convery, Ra\u00fal Castillo, Hamish Linklater, Tramell Tillman, and Stephen Lang. It\u2019s now in theaters and on VOD. \n\nFun fact: I first posted the script on r/Screenwriting , and the encouragement I got there helped push me to keep going and get it made. Barron\u2019s Cove is about the bond between fathers and sons, how it endures across time, and what it means to test that bond to its limits. At its heart, it\u2019s about confronting the limiting beliefs we place on ourselves, and discovering the strength to become something more, through love and legacy. I\u2019m here with Christian and Ra\u00fal to talk about the film, the process, and anything else you\u2019re curious about.

Mola Ram\u2019s terror when Indy starts cutting the rope is another great one. \n\nJust those looks of abject \u201cshit, I\u2019m not supposed to go down like this\u201d moments on a villain\u2019s face that makes the ending so much more satisfying. \n\nI find in action movies there\u2019s something really actually quite deflating and underwhelming about just killing the bad guy.

        "content": "Question, Are you glad Netflix is reviving Guillermo Del Toro's projects\n\nYou know I just realized something after watching Del Toro's Frankenstein teaser (Which I am anticipating). This is the second time Netflix has revived a Del Toro project that most people thought he wasn't going to make.\n\nLet me explain, the first time Netflix has revived a Del Toro Project was Pinocchio. Since, 2008 Del Toro had been trying to get his Pinocchio project off the ground and originally, The Jim Henson Company &amp; Pathe were helping him produce the film and at one point, Daniel Radcliffe, Tom Waits, and Christopher Walken were considered for roles. However the film went into development hell and in November of 2017, Del Toro stated that the film was dead and no studio wanted to finance it until in 2018, Netflix revived the project.\n\nNow, Frankenstein is the next film that Netflix has revived. I somewhat did a post on this but In 2014, Del Toro mentioned that making Frankenstein was one of his dream projects and that he was trying to get this made for at least a decade. Well in the 2010s, Del Toro almost got to made Frankenstein with the backing of Universal Pictures. From what I read, Del Toro wanted to make his Frankenstein a 2 part film due to the complexity of the novel. However, the film was cancelled in large part due to Universal decided to go with the Dark Universe route. Now, The film has now been revived at Netflix in large part due to Pinocchio's success.\n\nI find it interesting and exciting that Netflix has revived 2 projects that Del Toro has tried to make but failed with other studios. With Del Toro I have an analogy of throw spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks as with him he has multiples projects he wants to do but they never stick with studios so he goes to the one that sticks with the studio.\n\nUltimately, I am glad that Del Toro is doing these projects that we wanted to make for so long and I hope he &amp; Netflix revived further projects (Like At The Mountain Of Madness or The Left Hand Of Darkness or any other project Del Toro wanted to make).\n\nAll in All, Are you glad Netflix is reviving Guillermo Del Toro's projects",

        "content": "What\u2019s your favorite theater experience? Mine was seeing Return of the King. It was Christmas Eve. I was 10 years old. I had gotten hooked on the lord of the rings after having watched fellowship and two towers (didn\u2019t get to see those in the theaters). I had even read the books. Anyway, my dad told us that afternoon that we were going to go see it as our first Christmas gift. I wasn\u2019t expecting it and was so excited. I remember sitting in the theater as the lights went out and turning to my sister and saying that I couldn\u2019t believe we were about to watch it. And then we were treated to one of the best movies ever made imo. To this day that movie and that experience are still very special to me.",

How do we figure out when a film is geniune schlock or a bad movie? I don't think J.J. Abrams or Zack Snyder would be pleased to hear someone who said \"l loved turning my brain off to enjoy your film\" Why give the films they make labels the directors would avoid giving? Why defend slop so vigorously? \n\nI just feel like we are excusing low quality blockbusters rather than actually having fun schlock. What do you think on this?",
