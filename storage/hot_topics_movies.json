        "title": "December 27-29 Box Office Recap: 'Sonic 3' and 'Mufasa' fight for the top spot at the box office. 'Nosferatu' opens with a fantastic $40.3 million in its first five days, already becoming Robert Eggers' highest grossing film. 'A Complete Unknown' settles for sixth place with $23.1 million.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/k21dn07d40ae1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b2edf912cefe80f8f6936c9ec0814e5006ae794\n\n#**Normally you'd wait till the Weekend Actuals are out. But the numbers are delayed due to the holidays, so you'll only have estimates for now. The same could happen next week.**\n\nIt was a fierce battle at the box office.\n\n***Sonic 3*** and ***Mufasa: The Lion King*** fought for the top spot, with the hedgehog currently leaning on the top spot for now. On Christmas, we got 4 newcomers, with mixed results. ***Nosferatu*** delivered a fantastic debut and became Robert Eggers' highest grossing film in just 5 days, while ***A Complete Unknown*** had a very solid start. On the other hand, ***Babygirl*** had a soft start, while ***The Fire Inside*** failed to attract interest.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $159.2 million this weekend. That's up a huge 58% from last year, when ***Wonka*** returned to the top spot.\n\nStaying on top, ***Sonic 3*** earned $38 million this weekend ($59.9 million five-day). That represents a 37% drop, which is better than the previous films. There were concerns over the weekdays, as it appeared that it was front-loaded and would show weak legs, but it looks like it recovered for now.\n\nThrough ten days, the film has amassed $136.8 million. It should have another great hold this weekend, which will allow it to hit $200 million very soon. It can go as high as $250 million at this pace.\n\nSettling for second place, ***Mufasa*** made $37.1 million this weekend ($63.7 million five-day). That's a very nice 5% increase from last weekend. It had a soft debut but it's showing some strength. Through 10 days, it has made $113.4 million. Despite this increase, the film is still off a massive 68% from the 2019 film through the same point. We'll see how much it can earn through the holidays.\n\nExceeding expectations, Robert Eggers' ***Nosferatu*** debuted with a fantastic $21.1 million this weekend ($40.3 million five-day). This is not just Eggers' biggest debut by a wide margin, but it's already his highest grossing film domestically, passing ***The Northman*** ($34.2 million). It's also the fourth biggest debut for Focus Features.\n\nThis is an amazing result in any sense of the word, and showed that Eggers could finally hit the mainstream audience (***The Northman*** was supposed to be that film, but it didn't quite land at the box office). But that still raises the question: how was this film able to debut this high and far above Eggers' films? Credit must go to a fantastic marketing campaign, which offered enough intrigue and darkness to attract audiences. The decision to hide Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd's appearance as the iconic Count Orlok from the trailers panned out very well; if you want to watch him, you have to pay a ticket.\n\nIt can be said that Eggers' brand has also increased in past years. While ***The Northman*** wasn't a box office hit, Focus Features confirmed that the film eventually became profitable after a few months thanks to strong VOD numbers and other post-theatrical markets, and this was a big reason why they were confident in greenlighting ***Nosferatu***. Also, while remaking a 1922 silent German Expressionist film feels like it would struggle to get recognition, ***Nosferatu*** actually had some exposure to the audience. A lot of kids were introduced to this character in that iconic ***SpongeBob SquarePants*** episode. That helped the film build awareness. \n\nAccording to Focus Features, 55% of the audience was male and 56% of the audience was in the 18-34 demographic. While critics raved about the film, audiences wasn't as much; they gave it a weak \"B\u2013\" on CinemaScore. That's not actually a bad score for a horror film, given they often fall in the C range. Nevertheless, without horror competition till ***Wolf Man*** in mid January, ***Nosferatu*** should hold well through the holidays. While it's unclear how much it can earn, one thing is clear: this is hitting $100 million domestically, which is an amazing result.\n\n***Wicked*** rose 37%, adding $19.4 million this weekend ($31.7 million five-day). On Christmas day, it added a sing-along version, which boosted the numbers. The film has earned a fantastic $424 million so far.\n\nAfter its weak legs, ***Moana 2*** had its best drop so far. It jumped 38%, adding $18.2 million this weekend. A much needed recovery, given it wasn't holding well after its gigantic opening. The film has earned $394.6 million so far, and will hit the $400 million milestone in a few days.\n\nDebuting in sixth place, Searchlight's ***A Complete Unknown*** earned $11.6 million ($23.1 million five-day). This is one of the best debuts for Searchlight, and its opening day ($7.2 million) was a record for the studio. If we want to compare it to James Mangold's films, the five-day debut is slightly above of what ***Walk the Line*** made in 3 days ($22.3 million). \n\nThis is a solid start, and the only reason why it's not fantastic is that it's carrying an extensive $60-$70 million budget, putting a lot of pressure in the film. Bob Dylan is one of the most iconic singers and songwriters of the past century, although he is still not as popular as other musicians in other biopics. For example, Queen, Elton John and Bob Marley are more popular with current audiences than Dylan. So the film had only one selling point: its star Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet.\n\nLike him or not, Chalamet is one of the most popular young stars of our times. He already had huge hits in the past year with ***Wonka*** and ***Dune: Part Two***, and he's already set for another film, ***Marty Supreme***, which also opens on Christmas Day next year. Deadline reported that 36% of the audience watched the film for Chalamet, cementing a status as a box office draw. Reviews were also solid enough to win over audiences, and some Oscar buzz is on the horizon.\n\nAccording to Searchlight, the audience was equally split between men and women. Unsurprisingly, the big demo was adults; 62% of the audience was 35 and over. They gave it a strong \"A\" on CinemaScore, which bodes very well for its legs. And you have to remember that this is targeting an old audience, which doesn't rush out to watch a film as soon as possible. We'll keep an eye on this one, but the incoming Oscar buzz should help it stay in theaters for quite  a long time.\n\nIn a distant seventh place, A24's ***Babygirl*** earned $4.3 million ($7.2 million five-day). That's quite a soft start, especially considering that the film was playing in 2,115 theaters, and the fact that A24 pushed it as its main attraction for the holidays.\n\nThe film is sold as an erotic thriller, but that can be a mixed bag at the box office. Outside the ***Fifty Shades of Grey***, erotic thrillers haven't performed very well at the box office. And despite having a big name in Nicole Kidman, she hasn't had a good run as of late; she hasn't had a single box office hit since ***The Upside*** back in 2019. Her recent success has been on streaming and on TV, leaving questions over her star power at the box office (even though she's the face of AMC).\n\nAccording to A24, 53% of the audience was female and 44% of the audience was 35 and over. While critics were positive of the film, the audience wasn't forgiving; they gave it a very weak \"B\u2013\" on CinemaScore, which might be due to the nature of the film itself. While Kidman has some Oscar buzz, it would be a surprise if the film made anything above $20 million domestically.\n\n***Gladiator II*** continues showing some great late legs. The film eased just 9% and earned $4.1 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $163 million. It's gonna head to around $175 million.\n\nAngel Studios' ***Homestead*** had the worst drop in the Top 10. It dropped 47%, adding $3.1 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $12.8 million, and it suggests that it will fall off when the holidays are over.\n\nRounding up the Top 10 was the last newcomer of the week, Amazon MGM's ***The Fire Inside***. Despite setting it at 2,006 theaters, the film bombed with just $2 million ($4.3 million five-day). That's the 28th worst debut for any film playing at 2,000+ theaters.\n\nThis isn't a surprising result. Amazon didn't appear to focus on properly marketing the film, choosing to simply dump it on Christmas and hoping that it would find an audience. After all, ***The Boys in the Boat*** over-performed last year, showing there was a market for sports dramas. But the film simply lacked a hook; people simply weren't interested in Claressa Shields' story. Even with the talent involved, it simply wasn't enough.\n\nAccording to MGM, 51% of the audience was female and 51% was 35 and over. On the bright side, the audience gave it a strong \"A\" on CinemaScore, which fits nicely with its great reviews. But even with that, it's unlikely it can turn things around.\n\n***Kraven the Hunter*** slightly recovered after its awful second weekend drop, even if it fell on the bad side of the drops. It dropped 44%, adding $1.7 million this weekend. Sadly, with an anemic $21.3 million domestic total so far, there's nothing to celebrate here. It might hit $25 million, but it won't get much higher than that.\n\nBut while ***Kraven*** kept showing weak legs, ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** does not appear to have any legs. The film collapsed 63%, earning just $455,000 this weekend. Absolutely horrible considering the rest of the films had fantastic holds. The film has made just $8.5 million domestically, and it's now guaranteed to finish below $10 million.\n\nParamount chose to open the Robbie Williams biopic ***Better Man*** in 6 theaters, ahead of its wide release on January 10. But the film flopped with just $18,000 ($35,000 five-day), which translates to a very poor $3,000 per-theater average. Not a surprise, considering Williams failed to find an audience in America. This is a bad sign for its wide release.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Mufasa*** was still on top in the rest of the world, albeit only slightly. It added $77 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $327 million. The best markets currently are France ($20.9M), UK ($15.8M), Mexico ($15.5M), Italy ($14.4M) and Germany ($13.6M).\n\n***Sonic 3*** made its debut in the rest of the world, debuting with a dazzling $74 million in 52 markets, taking its worldwide total to $210 million. That's a huge 83% of the second film's debut. The best debuts were the UK ($15.1M), Mexico ($10.3M), France ($7.3M), Australia ($5.5M), Germany ($5.5M), Spain ($3.3M), Panama ($2.3M); Peru ($1.6M), Colombia ($1.3M) and Malaysia ($1.3M), all of which were records for the franchise. It should have no problem hitting $500 million, and it still has some markets left.\n\n***Moana 2*** added $36 million this weekend, and its worldwide total is now $882 million. The best markets are France ($53.9M), UK ($42.6M), Germany ($34.8M), Mexico ($28.2M) and Brazil ($25.7M).\n\nIn a major milestone, ***Wicked*** has now passed ***Mamma Mia!*** to become the highest grossing Broadway adaptation, with a current worldwide total of $634 million. The best markets are the UK ($67M), Australia ($24.8M), Korea ($14.2M), Germany ($11.8M) and Mexico ($9.9M).\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Heretic* | Nov/8 | A24 | $10,829,810 | $27,716,205 | $42,703,807 | $10M\n\n- A24's ***Heretic*** has closed with $42 million worldwide. That's a very solid start, even if the film didn't have a lot of staying power after its good debut. If Hugh Grant making a Jar-Jar impression is not enough to get you to buy a ticket, nothing will.",

Of course there's a famous scene early in the film where McClane kills one of Gruber's goons, then writes on his shirt, \"Now I have a machine gun. Ho, ho, ho!\" I could have SWORN there was an iconic callback to this scene later in the movie, when Gruber steals McClane's gun and disappears into a nearby elevator. Just as the doors close, Gruber says, \"Now \\*I\\* have a machine gun! Ho, ho, ho!\" with a delivery that brought down the house at my last theatrical screening in 2014.   \n  \nI spent the whole film waiting for this moment, my favorite moment in the film. And it never happened. Thinking maybe I had somehow zoned out and missed it, I googled the scene after the movie and ... I seem to have made it up? Imagined the entire sequence? It's a very surreal feeling, like learning that Robert Mitchum never sings \"Leaning on the Everlasting Arms\" in The Night of the Hunter. Thinking back on it, I suppose if Gruber had stolen a machine gun, he would have simply shot McClane and the film would've been over. ",

Now those kinds of movies are so far in between and mostly become Netflix filler even if the film is good it's buried by a cluttered algorithm. \n\n\n\n",

        "content": "I've seen Amadeus more than 20x over the years, but recently had the opportunity to see the Director's Cut for the first time... and was somewhat disappointed with it.\n\nThe Amadeus I've seen many times comes from the original DVD of the original theatrical release. When over at some friend's house recently, I suggested this movie, and the only version available for streaming was the DC.\n\nThe DC adds 20 minutes and a few sub-plots, and some gratuitous and unnecessary nudity. The sub-plots don't add much to the story, but do interrupt the flow of the original, which, in hindsight, was a masterfully edited in the way it flawlessly unrolled the story at a perfect pace.\n\nThe DC does add more music as well, which is great... except it also interrupts the aforementioned flow.\n\nWhile it was really cool to see these characters I've seen so many times in \"new\" situations, I feel the DC in this case was a step backwards from the original. Of course, having seen the original so many times and loved it, any changes made to this movie will be met with some serious scrutiny from me. And, of course, who am I to question Milos Forman -- it's his vision after all.\n\nAll that being said, I'd be interested to hear from those of you who've seen both versions of this movie, and which do you prefer?\n\nAnd, as per the title, are there other movies that come to mind that shouldn't have been meddled with? I know there are many Star Wars purists who have a lot to say. Any others?\n\n",

However William Powell movies like The Thin Man and Jewel Robbery are not. Lots of places have them for rent or buy digital but no streaming. Which if I have to purchase I would rather have a DVD or BluRay. \n\nAccording to google the last time this was asked here was 4yrs ago. Most suggestions were TCM, Max, Prime, or Criterion. Prime no longer has good selection IMO. Criterion seems ok but I haven't spent much time with it.  \n\n",

The choices in the dialogue and plot are epically dumb in the best possible way, and it's all dead serious. There's not a single attempt at comedy or comic relief. All purely unintentional. It's up there with stuff like Anaconda or Ewe Boll\nmovies, but somehow even better. The whole movie, you're just like: Wait.. noooo, they're not seriously. Yep! Wow. How could they have decided to go with that line?! We were blown away with entertainment from start to finish, but it IS a bad movie at the end of the day. The only downside is it leaves you wishing you could watch it for the first time again. Not much re-watching value. \n\nIt made us think a lot about what constitutes a so-bad-it's-good movie. I think the only rule is: You can't try to make one on purpose, like these corporate, faux-meta wink-wink, fake it's-so-bad-it's-good movies of today. The 80's and 90's are peppered with great ones, but I think the early 2000's were the apex. It's so embarrassing and hilarious what audiences thought was cool back then ",

        "title": "Lust, Caution (2007) and father complex ",
        "content": "I just finished watching Lust, Caution by Ang Lee and HOLY SHIT this is my favourite Ang Lee I've seen so far. I have almost nothing but praise to offer... but I understand the critique of the romanticization of rape in this film. I think that it is totally reasonable for a person to avoid and express distaste towards media with rape and violence in it (regardless of whether or not that film is condemning or supporting rape). I also agree that male filmmakers in general always seem to be a bit *too* interested in exploring the impact of rape on women, and are interested in articulating that with long rape scenes.\n\nThat being said, I think that Yee's sexual aggression in this film is crucial to a major part of Wong's character: her daddy issues. I'm actually surprised by how almost no one is talking about this, as I think her relationship with her father actually impacts a lot of her decisions.\n\n**Her relationships outside of Yee**\n\nDuring her escape to Hong Kong from the Japanese, she tells her friend that her dad originally took her younger brother with him to Britain to escape from the Japanese. When asked why he didn't take Wong with him, her father cites financial and political issues as excuses.\n\nThe first news that made her cry in the movie was her father remarrying in England. She first hides her despair in front of her roommate and promptly writes a congratulatory letter. However, she secretly cries her heart out in the darkness of a movie theatre. This is paralleled by the content of the movie she's watching, where the American actress says \"There are some things I can't bring myself to say...\" .\n\nAdditionally, the American man (in the movie Wong was watching) appears to be confessing his love for her despite the fact that her has a family, which resembles what Wong's father did by marrying the Englishwoman. Overall she seems quite heartbroken that her dad just forgot about her and started a new family far away.\n\nThe tears she shed during the nationalist play is channeled from her love and resentment towards her father, as he might as well be dead to her at that point.\n\n* Wong waiting for her father to send for her is paralleled by the play's character waiting for her brother to come back home from the war.\n* The play's character clearly sees her brother as a father figure, because he \"carried the whole family on his shoulders\" after the father died.\n* The brother, like Wong's dad, never comes home.\n* Because the brother died fighting for China, the play character starts making a speech about Chinese national pride. This is contrasted by her father abandoning her AND China itself.\n\nThe play can be seen as a microcosm of the whole movie: Her father left her, so she puts her energy towards the independence movement. Additionally, the play's character points out that Kuang's character resembles her brother- which is what I think Wong feels about Yee (I will get to that part later).\n\nOf course, I also acknowledge that she may have joined the movement because: (1) she intellectually agrees with it, (2) slight peer pressure, as the only people she is close with are her KMT friends, and (3) Kuang.\n\nKuang simultaneously represents everything her father is and is not. Kuang, unlike her father, is *passionate* about something and actually takes initiative to achieve it as soon as he gets the chance. While I don't think Wong's father is indifferent to her, it is clear that he lacks the initiative to get her home.\n\nHowever, by crushing on a guy who is already married to the independence movement, he clearly does not have space in his heart to be equally devoted to her as he is to the KMT. This is revealed to Wong through how he just let her and their friend have sex because both Kuang and Wong are virgins. If Kuang cared about Wong as much as he cared about the movement, he would've 'stepped up' and volunteered to lose their virginities together. In terms of how much they are *willing* to do for Wong, Kuang and Wong's dad are the same.\n\nSo basically, every man in Wong's life cared about her; but in a lukewarm, rational way: \"I can't bring you to England because I'm short on money\" and \"I can't take your virginity because I'm a virgin myself\". If her father or Kuang were even slightly obstructed from seeing her, they would most likely shrug it off and not 'take initiative' to be with her.\n\n**Wong's relationship with Yee**  \nAlthough I don't think Wong believes that Yee loves her unconditionally, Yee is the only man who shows 'initiative' and assertiveness beyond all reason. This is articulated in the rape scenes.\n\nIf you look at Yee's behaviour on paper, he just treats Mak (Wong's pseudonym) like a typical mistress. The bedroom is the only time where he expresses behaviour that is so aggressively passionate, that the level of violence feels like he's gonna kill her in any second.\n\nThese sex scenes are literally the only time when someone in Wong's life expressed passion to her- which is why I think she spared him at the end of the movie.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of the trope that all of women's bad decisions and toxic taste in men stem from a weak father figure, I do think this film expresses articulates idea in an interesting manner.",
