        "content": "A few weeks ago I made a [post about a great box office fantasy game a redditor has been perfecting for the last few years.](https://old.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1pk1m27/introducing_the_fantasy_box_office_game_two_years/)\n\n# www.FantasyBoxOfficeGame.com\n\nThis is a year-long fantasy game that involves three seasonal drafts. It's a great low-key way to add some excitement to each movie release and as someone who's been playing it the last two years with coworkers/other redditors I can attest it's an absolute blast. \n\nEven though 2026 has begun you can still have your first draft any time. My leagues are drafting this week but January is so slow release-wise there's still plenty of time to put a good league together. \n\nIf you want to know more about the game check out the reddit post I linked above or just head over to the site to check it out! It's **totally free** to play and the UI is very intuitive. Big shoutout to /u/Chris_Tennant for making the site over these past few years!\n\nSo check it out and let us know if you have any questions! Happy New Year!",

        "title": "\"Click\" (2006) has one of the most jarring tonal shifts.",
        "content": "I went back and rewatched \"Click\" tonight, fully expecting a dumb Adam Sandler comedy featuring fart jokes, fast-forwarding through boring meetings, and yelling at his kids. And for the first half, that\u2019s exactly what it is. It plays like a standard 2000s Sandler vehicle. There's broad humor, a silly sci-fi premise, and the fantasy of skipping the annoying parts of life.\n\nBut somewhere around the midpoint, the movie quietly pulls the rug and what starts as a series of jokes about laziness and convenience turns into something tragic. The remote doesn\u2019t just skip arguments or work stress; it skips life and the movie leans into the ramifications of that. The film\u2019s tonal shift is genuinely surprising, especially coming from a movie that marketed itself as pure stupid comedy. Suddenly we\u2019re watching missed moments stack up. The kids growing up, relationships eroding, parents aging. The laughs slow down, and the jokes feel hollow in retrospect.\n\nThe scene that really hits is the last moment Sandler has with his father played by Henry Winkler. It\u2019s not subtle but it works. Sandler, who has shown dramatic chops in other films and isn't a one-note comedian, taps into something raw and sincere here. You can feel the regret and panic of realizing you\u2019ve fast-forwarded past the things that actually mattered.\n\nWhat makes \"Click\" linger (\"Linger\" by the Cranberries plays a pivotal role) is how universal that fear is. We all joke about wanting to skip stress or monotony, but the movie forces you to confront the cost of disengaging from the present. It isn't amazing, but it hits closer to home than other films because the tonal shift is so jarring.\n\nFor a goofy comedy, \"Click\" ends up being weirdly memorable for how existential it becomes.",

The whole movie was just unlike anything that had ever come out before. It has a few small editing issues, but damn man, it is just one of those movies that had to be seen in the theater to fully appreciate how good it was. That was peak Russell Crowe and peak Ridley Scott.",

        "content": "Been rewatching a lot of action films like The Last Boy Scout, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard 1-3, Action Jackson, Speed, etc. \n\nAside from all looking fantastic, all crunchy textures and sweaty biceps on 35mm, but the scripts were whitty, energetic and well-structured. Critics and audiences loved them. \n\nAction goes through trends like any other genre; The Raid/John Wick style action is/was all the rage for awhile, and while those are good, they just don't feel as memorable or well written as the stuff in the 80s and 90s. The Joel Silver, Joel Schumacher era, I guess? \n\nWe can point out several things from increase in CG explosions &amp; gunshots, to the rise of superhero cinema to streaming channels taking the smaller budget action films, but there's a specific type of big Hollywood action film we just don't get anymore.

        "content": "I'm from the generation whose 007 was Roger Moore. So let's just say I have a certain affection for him. I was rewatching Moonraker and I realized he wasn't too different from, I don't know, when he did \"The Saint\" or \"The Persuaders\" That is, a very British character, with great aplomb, who never takes himself too seriously. And let's just say he did that very well. I tried to look at his filmography and I don't think there are many films where he tries to do something different. Maybe \"The Wild Geese,\" but I last saw it like 30 years ago.\n\nSo I ask, what's the general opinion about this actor? That he could only do one thing and did it very well? Or are there gems in his filmography where he was able to showcase his talent?\n\nOh, I saw he was also in Curse of the Pink Panther. I remember his cameo. It was one of the most embarrassing things I've ever seen in a movie.",

        "content": "I finally watched Drive this weekend (loved it). I'm really into Synthwave and I found Cliff Martinez on Spotify and ended up living the Drive score which in turn sent me to the movie. I could rent it for 4 bucks on Amazon, or buy it for 5 bucks, so I bought it.\n\n  \nOnly to find it doesn't have the actual original score anymore. It's still great, but the music I've been listening to is so much better. So it looks like the movie was scored twice, or re-scored for the UK, and that's all Amazon offers streaming now.\n\n  \nI'm about to buy the Blue Ray but I was curious if any of you have the Blue Ray and can confirm if it is the OG score.\n\n  \nThanks!",

        "content": "For the last few months, I've been trying to find all of Christopher Nolan's films, so I can watch them and see what I think. I've seen The Prestige, Inception, Interstellar, The Dark Knight trilogy (of course), and now Memento. I'm trying not to rush through the rest. I've still got a good handful to go, but I'm really enjoying his films so far.  Memento is my favorite of the ones I've seen because I love the story and the way it's told. Honestly I recommend it to anyone who wants mind-boggling mystery. I really really enjoyed it",

(preferably pre-Covid back when everybody was normal, happy and enjoyed life)\n\nMine was actually How The Grinch Stole Christmas (2000). I remember that movie was so big at the time and I ended up going (not intentionally) like 4 times in the same month. My friends wanted to see it, then I went with family, then I went with my cousins or something. But overall I watched it like 4 times. One time I had to sit in the front row, was forced to do it, because of how many people were there. Never sat in the front row again lol.\n\nIn hindsight though it was a really unique experience because it was my own personal phenomenon. That was like peak Carrey too ... Miss his movies ... Miss comedies in general",

        "content": "I just finished watching Nightcrawler and it honestly left me feeling disturbed. The movie has a very cold, dark vibe and never tries to make you feel comfortable. It slowly pulls you into a world where ambition matters more than morality.\nJake (Lou Bloom) really got under my skin. He\u2019s obsessive, manipulative, and feels completely empty inside. The moment he lets his partner die just to get exclusive footage genuinely made me angry, which says a lot about how effective the film is.\nJake Gyllenhaal was incredible. The calm way he plays Lou, the forced smiles, and the lack of empathy feel disturbingly real. I hated the character, but I have a lot of respect for the performance.\nIt\u2019s not a fun watch at all, but it\u2019s a powerful and uncomfortable one. Curious how others felt about it.",
