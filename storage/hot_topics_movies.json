If I'm not mistaken, Clive Barker wasn't fond of the film version of Rawhead Rex and his disappointment with it was a big factor in him directing the original Hellraiser film.",

I was also a lot closer to the demographic of the characters in The movie. \n\nI decided to watch it again but I only got about 30 minutes into it. I felt like all of the characters were unlikable, the plot was meandering and there was nothing funny that happened or anybody said. Just all in all not very entertaining.  I guess a person changes a lot in 31 years and so does one's taste.",

But I found myself saying out loud to my husband that this was a good twist on the usual horror films. I kept waiting for the jump scares. \n\nNot the best movie, but it was a fun watch. If you don't take movies too seriously, I would suggest it. ",
