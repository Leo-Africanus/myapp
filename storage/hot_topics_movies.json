        "title": "I watched several dozen old noir films. Here are the best in my opinion.",
        "content": "As the title says, I recently sat down to watch several dozen noir films from the \"classic period\" of the 40's and 50's. I've always had an interest in noir, but struggled to find the initiative to watch such old movies. I got the opportunity from a recent trip home, and was (mostly) delighted by what I saw. I wanted to share my recommendations across different categories for anyone who was interested.\n\n*Favourite cinematography:* **Night of the Hunter (1955).** About a serial killing preacher who marries into a grieving family to try and find some buried cash. It has some astoundingly beautiful shots, especially in how it plays with light and darkness. Standout is the scene where two characters having a stand-off sing to one another in the night.\n\n*Favourite acting:* **Sunset Boulevard (1950).** A scriptwriter gets involved with an ageing actress who can't come to terms with her fading star. A film about film, Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond has incredible range; she somehow manages to pull off being hammy, pathetic, terrifying, and funny, sometimes at the same time. A lot of old films \"feel\" old and antiquated, but this one is electrifying even by today's standards.\n\n*Favourite scene:* **Strangers on a Train (1951).** The OG story of \"criss cross\" murders, where a psychopath kills someone for a stranger, and then demands said stranger do the same for him in return. Robert Walker as the unhinged Bruno is just so hammy and fun to watch, and in particular the scene where he stares emotionlessly at the protagonist from across the tennis court is iconic. (I like tennis, so maybe I'm biased.)\n\n*Favourite plot:* **Out of the Past (1947).** A PI with a dark past is dragged back into one final sordid affair. With slimy gangsters, a country-spanning plot, the definitive femme fatale, and a deeply nihilistic ending, this feels like a hardboiled novel that leaped right onto the screen.\n\n*Favourite concept:* **Double Indemnity (1944).** An insurance broker helps his lover murder her husband, and then has to do what he can to cover it up. I suppose we've all wondered if we could get away with murder, and this film really shows the grittiness of the affair as the noose tightens around the protagonist's proverbial throat.\n\n*Favourite overall film:* **In a Lonely Place (1950).** A violent scriptwriter gets involved with a beautiful young neighbour, but questions of his involvement in a murder strain their relationship. I saw about 5 Humphrey Bogart films in this time and this is his best role by far. The steady, gradual march to the explosive ending is executed perfectly. I honestly didn't think that such old films could really emotionally \"connect\" with me, but this one left me stunned with its brilliance and pathos. Easily one of my top 10 of all time.\n\nThat's that! There's obviously other good ones (\"Woman in the Window\", \"A Touch of Evil\", etc.) but I think the above gets the point across.\n\nHave you seen the above films? Do you have any other favourites I missed?",

It's your usual run of the mill partner turns on the good cop action movie where the good cop seeks revenge, however, the acting in this movie was atrocious, especially from Chuck Norris.  Emotion was non-existent.  Every scene with him looked like he was spacing out, staring into the void, reciting a handful of boring lines.  He looked so uninterested, even when teaching a bullied teen how to stick up for himself.  Is this the norm for his movies?  Is he worse than 90s Steven Seagal?  How did Walker, Texas Ranger run for almost ten years?  Please tell Cobra is better than this movie.",

        "content": "Just re-watched this and was amazed at just how good a movie it is. I remember really loving the film, but I didn't remember it being as good as it is.  Aside from being still cool &amp; entertaining as hell from the jump all the way through to Joe Walsh's song (which I forgot was from this), it is really well written. The dialogue is succinct and meaningful, particularly between Mercy and Swan.\n\nCame across this interview with Michael Beck.  The scene on the subway, when they see the prom kids, is one of the most famous &amp; best scenes in the movie, although obviously there are many.  It is really wild that they filmed separately.  Makes the acting all the more impressive.  That scene says so much with not a word of dialogue &amp; and then the great scene that follows where he hands her the corsage and clearly wants her to escape with him.  Excellent film.  Thoughts?",

        "title": "Adam Driver collects great directors like Pokemon",
        "content": "It's pretty clear to me that Driver's philosophy is that if he works with amazing directors, he's going to improve his chances of being in great movies and improve his craft.  While it doesn't always work out and he sometimes has small roles, for the most part it does seem to pay off.  Driver's average movie score on Metacritic is 70/100 with movies like Baumbach's \"Marriage Story\" (94/100), Coen Brothers' \"Inside Llewyn Davis\" (93/100), Jarmush's \"Paterson\" (90/100) and Spielberg's \"Lincoln\" (87/100) at the top.\n\nOther than Daniel Day Lewis (76/100), you'd struggle to find other actors with average metacritic scores as high as Driver.  For example,  Dicaprio (64/100), Cruise (62/100), Frances McDormand (67/100), Joaquin Phoenix (63/100), Denzel (64/100), Hanks (62/100).\n\nDriver seems to seek out roles like he's adding great directors to his Pok\u00e9dex.\n\n**Adam Driver's Pokedex:**\n\n**1.

Jeff Nichols**\n\n* **Driver\u2019s Film**: *Midnight Special* (2016)\n* **Notable Films**: *Take Shelter* (2011), *Mud* (2012), *Loving* (2016)\n\n**Additional Thoughts**\n\n* **Flops:** It's interesting that some of the biggest duds Driver has been involved in also happen to be from some of the greatest directors past their prime.  Coppolla's \"Megalopolis\", Gilliam's \"Man who Killed Don Quixote\", Ridley Scott's \"House of Gucci\" a few examples, but if the idea is to soak up everything you can from the greatest to ever do it, your opportunities to work with legends in their mid-80s are limited.\n* **Future Targets:**  I imagine there certain consistently panned directors, like Zack Snyder (average metacritic score in the 40s with peak being 59/100), that he'd want to avoid, but I'd take a wild guess that Driver's agent has an open call to directors like Paul Thomas Anderson, Quentin Tarantino, Christopher Nolan, Denis Villenueve, etc that's like \"Hey... my boy is ready when you are\".  Who do you guess is at the top of his wish list?\n* **Driver a Future Director?:** I don't know if he's ever expressed an interest in making his own projects, but it would be difficult to find someone who has worked on films with that many incredible directors.  You have to imagine he's learned a lot.  That's like the world's greatest filmmaking masterclass.  He kinda owes it to everyone to give directing a shot at some point.",
