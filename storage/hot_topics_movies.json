Definitely the best villain whose surname isn't Gruber in this franchise. \n\nSo over all this movie is like a 7/10. ",

Let's be honest, she left Tony because she could see the writing on the wall, he was headed to a tragic end and she wasn't going to stay and end up made into swiss cheese alongside the self destructive Tony.\n\nEvery relationship she had was a business exchange with the purpose of leaving her protected and safe. That was her arrangement with Frank and it was now Tony and Tony knew that and that's why he treated her like crap because he wanted her to be like Gina but she was just a tramp looking to be a kept woman. \n\nThe sad thing is that Tony ended up losing the two people who loved him for who he was: Manny, his best friend, whom he killed out of a sense of betrayal, and Gina, who hated his guts before dying. \n\nElvira was the smart one because she got off the bus before the crash but not before telling Tony off for how he treated her.",

The journey is more important than the surprise. The movie does a good job showing the weight of each choice the characters make.\n\nRalph Fiennes was amazing in this movie. He did not need big speeches or action scenes. His face, his voice, and his small movements said a lot. He made his character feel real and thoughtful.\n\nThis film may not be for everyone, but if you enjoy serious stories and good acting, I think you will enjoy The Conclave.\n\nCan anyone recommend some similar movies ?",

        "content": "Question, Do you wish Peter Jackson's Halo got made?\n\nIn the 2000s, Peter Jackson attempted to make a Halo film with him as Producer and Neil Blomkamp was going to direct it &amp; Alex Garland was going to write the script. However, the film wasn't made due to several reasons. 1 was that Microsoft had very strict terms, demanding $10\u00a0million against 15\u00a0percent of gross. 20th Century Fox &amp; Universal both decided to partner on the film. However after awhile, 20th Century Fox threaten to pull, &amp; Universal demanded Jackson to reduced his first dollar revenue deal, which he refused, thus, Halo was cancelled. Another was that the production was plagued with problems with pre-production being re-started multiple times.\n\nI kinda wish the film got made, but one thing that came out of this was that Peter Jackson decided to help Blomkamp make District 9, which I enjoyed. However, I do think if the film did get made, if probably would of been a disaster given that Microsoft was micro-managing the hell out of the project and that fact the production was really on shaky ground with the multiple studios teaming up.\n\nOverall, Do you wish Peter Jackson's Halo got made?",

The way he treated the old man with respect and trusted his experience and skills even though he had clear deficiencies was amazing. \n\nThe way he said goodbye to the old man in the end was emotional for a horror movie as well. \n\nI think overall this movie was better than its reviews. \n\nWhat is everyone's opinion about it? \n\nAlso, I like how it gives some insight to the old man's past, leaving it ambiguous to the viewer to make up in their minds what the old\nMan has seen. \nIt also doesn't give much back story about Bright Hope or the people who live there or how it was established. \n\nAlso, what do you guys think about the ending when the old\nMan throws the rock? Does the sheriff survive? All good things to think about. ",

        "content": "\n\nThe whole premise is bonkers but so clever it how it serves as a metaphor for how ethnic minorities, black people in this case, are utilized as drones of consumption and how this perpetuates negative stereotypes (e.g. Fried chicken, obsession with hair products, selling drugs, etc.). It shows how to be critical of those consumer goods we're obsessed with. What makes us feel good or \"look cool\" to others isn't necessarily good for us. \n\nI also love the point it made when Fontaine almost gave up and accepted his fate as a mere clone living in a vicious cycle. Even after people figure out the trap, that knowledge alone won't keep you from falling into it again and again. We might be products of our environment and even our genetics, but at the end of the day, we have free will, and it's up to us to break free from the cycle we are stuck in.\n\n\nI myself am Latino (Puerto Rican to be exact) and I feel like many points made in the film apply to my culture as well. In recent years, Puerto Rican culture has become a bit more known internationally, thanks to things like Bad Bunny and the Despacito song. While there is nothing wrong with people being curious of and being entertained by the culture, there is also a concerted effort to perpetuate pretty offensive and harmful stereotypes about my people: From sexual promiscuity thanks to reggaeton music to the idea that we all live in slums next to the beach. And many fellow Puerto Ricans end up internalizing these stereotypes and thinking it makes us \"cool\". \n\nThe film just really spoke to me this way, and feel it even applies to other ethnicities or minority groups. Great film. It was like Us, but actually good. Also had no idea Boyega had such range in acting. He was phenomenal.",

        "content": "I just saw warfare, I\u2019m gonna try and be as spoiler light as I can.. where do I start. Warfare is not a movie, it\u2019s an experience. I have never in my life felt that overwhelmed and stressed by a movie. The sound design is unforgiving and overwhelming and loud. The movie barely has a story (compared to something like saving private Ryan or lone survivor), but it doesn\u2019t need one. The point of the movie is not to tell you a riveting story about a squad that gets pinned down and makes a miraculous effort to escape. The point of this movie is to drag you to the deep end and try and drown you. With a run time of 1hr 35 minutes, it feels like it\u2019s about 40 minutes long. You get so sucked in and feel like you are there. The movie is insanely fast paced. I love war movies, and this one might take the cake for the most intense and overwhelming war movie I\u2019ve seen. \n\n\nI can see and appreciate where people come from if they say they don\u2019t like it. There really isn\u2019t a story, there\u2019s not really a beginning, middle, or end to what you are watching. It just kind of starts. To me, this is why it\u2019s called warfare.. that\u2019s what you\u2019ll witness watching it. That\u2019s what it\u2019s about. I think out of the entire cast my brain remembered two character names. \n\nSorry for the long rant. Just finished watching it and just kinda trying to put together words for what I just experienced, if you enjoy the war movie genre, go see it. It\u2019s worth it. I\u2019m curious to hear opinions from people who have seen it as well. ",

        "content": "It's the most refreshing movie I've seen in a while.\n\nIt has competent filmmaking unlike a lot of actual modern films do with their bland drone shots and lethargic pacing, and the way the movie is a thriller that flubs its own suspense by making it too character driven is kind of charming. The scene when he punches his wife in the face made my burst out laughing. I also started chuckling at the Snakes scene when the hyperactive piano music plays and the whole direction is just telling the cast to run around the house screaming in a failed attempt to make the audience feel panicked.\n\nBut what I actually love about it is how nice the characterization is. The characters do feel kind of relatable. The plot plays on the dad sounding like he's becoming obsessed with the crook, while the wife is too trusting in other people to rule him out yet. But just as you think the movie is going with that lame \"Now she's gonna lose trust her husband and get tricked by the bad guy\" the movie does give her agency as she hears her husband ranting about it, and she knows him well enough to know he wouldn't say all that without knowing what he's doing.\n\nI also like the kids in the movie, how the boy is a real boy, who runs his mouth at people saying \"My dad will beat you!\" And he has premature empathy trying to comfort the sister when their horse is found dead, by saying \"don't worry, dad will find out who did it and kill them!\"\n\nI can't see this as a failure. This is an enjoyable movie with real characters, and I have become so tired of all movies needing \"subtext\" as their primary merit to the point where I found it genuinely nice to just have a pedestrian narrative that makes me think \"what's gonna happen now?\"",

        "content": "Asterix is a beloved French comic book series created by writer Ren\u00e9 Goscinny and illustrator Albert Uderzo, first published in 1959. Set in 50 BC, it follows the adventures of a small village of indomitable Gauls as they resist Roman occupation. The titular hero, Asterix, is a diminutive but cunning warrior who, alongside his loyal, super-strong friend Obelix, defends their village with wit, bravery, and a magic potion brewed by the druid Getafix, granting temporary superhuman strength. Obelix, perpetually strong due to falling into the potion as a child, carries a menhir and loves wild boar and brawls.The series blends slapstick humor, clever wordplay, and historical satire, poking fun at Roman bureaucracy and cultural stereotypes while celebrating Gaulish camaraderie. Each album sees Asterix and Obelix embark on quests\u2014whether thwarting Caesar\u2019s schemes, exploring foreign lands like Britain or Egypt, or protecting their village from internal strife. The comics are renowned for their vibrant art, memorable characters like the tone-deaf bard Cacofonix, and timeless appeal across generations. Translated into over 100 languages, Asterix remains a cultural icon with comic books fans around the world!",
