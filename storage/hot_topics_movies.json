That moment where vou're watching your childhood favorite and suddenly thinking 'wait... the 'villain' was completely right.\n\nThe killer responses come when people realize they BECAME the character they used to hate. Watching Dead Poets Society and siding with the cautious parents Seeing The Little Mermaid and thinking Triton had valid concerns about his 16-year-old daughter. That vertigo of realizing you've crossed to the other side of the story.",

I was wondering if I could get some recommendations for some movies that in some way glorify killing Nazis (or general white supremacists/fascists). \n\nI want something that feels like the Wolfenstein game reboots, though I'm open to more grounded films, as long as they have some form of Nazi suffering by the end.\n\nOn my list so far are three films that I feel demonstrate the vibe I'm seeking better than my words:\n\n\\- JoJo Rabbit (2019) *dir. Taika Waititi*\n\n\\- BlacKkKlansman (2018) *dir. Spike Lee*\n\n\\- Inglorious Basterds (2009) *dir. Quentin Tarantino*\n\n*(also maybe Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) dir. Steven Spielberg)*\n\nI would love a wide array of suggestions. Any setting from the 1930s to the future, in any country, in any multiverse. I'm sure there's some old WWII propaganda films that could fit the bill, or niche animated superhero from the 50s and 60s. Just remember that the Nazis don't have to be WWII German Nazis, as long as they were inspired by them. Thank you!",

It's a tense WW2 action drama starring Burt Lancaster as Labiche, a French rail master trying to prevent the Nazis from looting French artworks. Paul Scofield is the perfect antagonist trying to secure the French treasures for Nazi Germany.\n\nI first saw this about 40 years ago as it was one of my father's favourites and I have to agree. It's tense, emotional, plenty of action, and beautifully shot, with great performances by everyone. Special mention to Papa Boule (Michel Simon) for just being a hero and Jeanne Moreau as Christine, the hotel owner who gives refuge to Labiche. \n\nWatch it and you won't be disappointed. It's a Desert Island Discs kind of movie IMO.",

A movie revealing information to you, the audience, before the characters know it, is not \u201cspoiling\u201d the story.  You having information that the characters don\u2019t is a purposeful technique that writers use to create suspense, to make you more sympathetic to the characters, or even to provide comic relief to tension being built up. No matter the reason, it\u2019s on purpose, it\u2019s part of the story. Not every movie would be better if everything was completely subjective from the character\u2019s point of view. ",
