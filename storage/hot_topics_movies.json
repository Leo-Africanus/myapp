        "content": "Hi Reddit.  I\u2019m Rob Sarkies, New Zealand director of Pike River (starring the wonderful Mel Lynskey).  Pike River is a drama that depicts a mining tragedy that affected an entire community and their fight for justice and accountability.  It was made in close collaboration with the real subjects so questions around process of working with real people to tell their stories in a dramatic form might be of particular interest to some.  But it's an AMA so happy to answer any questions at all, of course, including random questions about New Zealand! Can\u2019t wait to connect with you all on Monday - Rob Sarkies\n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YOnuqAzTj4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YOnuqAzTj4)\n\n  \n**Synopsis:**\n\n&gt;On Nov. 19, 2010, a coal mine explosion in New Zealand kills Anna Osborne's husband and Sonya Rockhouse's son, along with 27 other men.

Bringing a level of raw, soulful intensity that makes the history feel incredibly personal, while James Horner's score turns the final act into something cinematic and spiritual.

The invasion of Poland was suddenly framed as \"self-defense\" against \"Polish aggression.\" \n\nThe film shows how he controlled the narrative, used emotional triggers, and erased contradictions.

It\u2019s not necessarily a 10/10 \"masterpiece\" that critics are falling over themselves to praise, but it\u2019s the one you put on when you\u2019re tired, sick, or just want to turn your brain off and feel okay for two hours.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s\u00a0**Back to the future**. There\u2019s something about the pacing and the fact that I know every line by heart that makes it impossible to turn off and It\u2019s not a \"chore\" to watch. In a world of three-hour prestige dramas that demand your undivided attention, there\u2019s a specific kind of magic in a movie that just wants to entertain you.\n\nWhat\u2019s the movie you\u2019ve seen fifty times that\u00a0never gets old, and what is that one specific scene that still hits even when you\u2019re barely awake?\n\nedit: I didn\u2019t realize the \"pacing\" debate was such a hot-button issue. My bad if the \"chore\" comment touched a nerve I\u2019m just a guy who values a tight script and a Saturday morning vibe. Let\u2019s get back to the movies. Whether it\u2019s a 90-minute comedy or a 4-hour epic, what\u2019s the one film that *always* makes you feel better?",

        "content": "I\u2019ve been craving a legal drama recently so I watched Philadelphia. I was thoroughly satisfied with the film, but I came to a realization that I had been dismissive of for years now\u2026. \u201cThey don\u2019t make them like they used to\u201d. Now I\u2019m 20 years old, so since the films I\u2019m gonna talk about most got released whilst my parents with in high school, but for some reason the 90s were the golden age of legal dramas. \n\nMy favorite legal drama of all time is My Cousin Vinny, A Time To Kill, which was released in 1996 is my 2nd favorite legal drama of all time. A Few Good Men, which was released in 1992 is my 3rd favorite legal drama.\n\nThe Trial of The Chicago 7, released in 2020, is clearly an outlier, because it\u2019s probably my favorite movie of that year, but if I name other films I love in the genre it\u2019d be Primal Fear 1996, Sleepers 1996, and now Philadelphia 1993.\n\nThere are a few recent films I\u2019ve watch in the genre I\u2019ve rather enjoyed, namely being Lincoln Lawyer 2011, Just Mercy 2019, Runaway Jury 2003, Fracture 2007 (though it\u2019s been a while and I\u2019ve forgotten most of it), the Judge 2014 (same as Fracture), and one I didn\u2019t like quite that much was Roman J Israel Esq.\n\nI look at all the ones I\u2019m yet to see and am most excited about, and I see a pattern emerge. Presumed Innocent 1990, The Pelican Brief 1993, The Firm 1993, The Rainmaker 1997, The Client 1994. \n\nObviously I\u2019m leaving out others on my watchlist lie The Verdict 1982 and Dark Waters 2019, but there seems to be a sharp decline in Legal Dramas being made, especially those released in theaters. Since Covid, the closest I\u2019ve gotten to seeing a legal thriller in a cinema was Oppenheimer, and my god was I transfixed by it.\n\nHave there been any that have slipped under my radar? Or is it a dying genre?",

        "content": "Hi all, I\u2019m looking for movies with long one shots / long takes. Not necessarily the super flashy \u201chey look no cuts\u201d kind, but ones that are actually nice to watch, where the camera feels calm and you get time to take in the space and what\u2019s happening in the background.\nOne example I really like is the mirror scene in Contact, which still feels kind of magical / mind bending and not showy at all. I\u2019m also thinking of shots like the opening of Children of Men or the Copacabana shot in Goodfellas, where the long take actually adds something instead of distracting you.\nAny recommendations for movies or specific scenes that do this well? Happy to hear both obvious ones and more obscure picks.",
