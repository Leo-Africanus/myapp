        "title": "The wife in Pursuit of Happiness is as almost completely justifiable",
        "content": "I grew up thinking the wife in Pursuit of Happiness was a bitch but as an adult, I completely understand her. \n\nThe movie tells us at the very beginning they were doing decently enough as a middle class/working class family *until* Chris invested their entire life savings into a portable bone-density scanner. A medical device whose concept and price tag would have been immediately bullshit to any sensible person. A man as intelligent as the movie sells Chris to be, would have to be extremely arrogant in order to pursue it. \n\nImagine you have a small child and your husband throws everything away on a delusional business idea. That alone alone would be justifiable enough for a divorce but to make matters worse, he refused to count his losses and get a real job to help support their family. She worked countless hours and seemed to do the brunt of the child care while he wasted all day and night trying to sell those machines. When he gives her last minute calls to tell her she\u2019ll have to pick up their son, he is almost sociopathic in his annoyance when she complains about how it effects her job or that she won\u2019t have any break. When she is finally at her wits end from the stress and desperation of their situation, he tells her that he wants to take a low paying internship to be a stockbroker. His wife and child were a breath away from starving on the streets while he jumps from one outlandish dream to the next. She was right to cut her losses at the moment. \n\nHer only failure was not fighting harder to keep custody of their son since she seemed to have slightly better financial stability and job security. She should not have let Christ guilt and bully her into believing their son was better off with him. Chris loved his son but a person who would selfishly allow their child to be homeless on the street so he could keep a low paying internship instead of getting a decent paying job has no right to keep custody of that child. Chris could have still been an active parent by visiting him instead of forcing his son to live that way. \n\nThe only reason why it\u2019s heartwarming is because he got the job in the end instead of he and his son being shanked one random night while living in public bathrooms. The reward doesn\u2019t justify the risk he took with his son\u2019s safety just so he could be a father. ",

I never understood why it hasn\u2019t gotten the same love as some of his other work. \n\nThis movie is like Clue\u2014if Colonel Mustard were packing a revolver and everyone was ready to stab, shoot, or poison each other at the drop of a hat!\n\nSet in a remote cabin during a snowstorm, the film has the perfect vibe for a Winter season watch.\n\nWith sharp dialogue, intense character dynamics, and great atmosphere, it expertly combines Tarantino's style with the structure of a classic whodunit. Not to mention, it\u2019s hilarious! Easily one of his funniest films. ",

        "title": "Which disaster movie gives the best feeling of \"calm before the storm\"(yes this can include horror like Zombies, it just has to be large scale)?",
        "content": " One of my favorite aspects of these movies is the moments before the disasters. We, the audience, know what is coming. The characters don't. It's this feeling that something big is unfolding and none of these characters has any clue that the world around them is about to end. \n\n We are often times treated to snippets of news reports in the background, often ignored by the main characters. They're either too busy with work, or they just flip the channel as soon as the news anchor describes a big event or breaking news comes on.   \n   \n If it's more horror-oriented, you think about which one of these characters is gonna die a horrible death. You fear for the family, you fear for the world in the movie.\n\nThe other aspect of these moments is that you attribute them to your own reality and wonder \"What if this was our situation, our moment before disaster?\"\n\n  \n For me, It would be like War of The Worlds and the Dawn of The Dead remake. \n\n  \nWar of The Worlds because the whole calm feels foreboding. You're with this family and you're seeing signs on the news about what is unfolding. Everything seems mundane but the vibe is just knowing shit is gonna go down and this family has no clue.\n\nDawn of The Dead because it gives a feeling of impending doom. Considering the type of movie it is. Because the whole scenario is horrifying so you're watching a glimpse of life before it turns into a nightmare..\n\n  \nBonus mention would be Threads, because the scenario can be a potential reality for us all, and we all relate to watching the news about wars and escalation. Especially since the Russian invasion. So it's more horrifying because it is a more relatable sense of dread and uncertainty.",

        "content": "David Lynch has died. I am very young so I don't know a lot of his projects. But recently, just two days ago, I have seen The Straight Story.\n\nThe Straight Story is a movie about an old man who wants to visit his brother. Therefor, he travels 300 miles on a lawn mower. Can you believe it? You should, because it's based on facts.\n\nThe movie looks and sounds good. Beautiful landscapes mix with calm and melancholic music that feels like a soft summer breeze.\n\nOf course, the old man faces some challenges on his way. In Road Movie tradition, there are some stations he crosses, where he gets to know different kind of people.\n\nBut none of them are evil. Everyone is ready to help the man and the man is ready to help everyone. Humanity rules. The word \"Thank You\" means something. Characters inspire each other. Every new situation feels unique and valuable.\n\nThis makes \"The Straight Story\" a wonderful departure from darkness, be it natural, in our all lives, or fictional, before we press play on the next thriller.\n\nI enjoyed this little experience very much. \nEven though I come from germany, which is why my english may not be the very best, I want to say one thing....\n\nThank you, David Lynch.",

It showed what cinema truly means: that its a form of entertainment that will bring joy and happiness to your life even when it's boring and black-and-white. \n\nWhat other iconic scenes in film encapsulate the meaning of cinema?",

Immediately sold on it and popped it on not expecting much.\n\nHoly cow!  Such a fun ride of a movie!  not a typical Ryan Reynolds acting job/vibe.  He really made me feel like he was an awkward silent guy and never once was I think \u201cwow that\u2019s a funny deadpool bit\u201d or thinking of any of his other works cause I was entranced.  lol.\n\nAnna Kendrick also did a great job in her role, along with her coworkers in it lol.

        "content": "There have been a few movies that for one reason or another I really didn't think I'd like so I avoided them only to reluctantly watch them later and be pleasantly surprised at how much I liked them. For example:\n\n- For the longest time I avoided **Tropic Thunder** because it came out around the same time as Pineapple Express and from trailers and initial friends' reactions I feared it was going to have too much of the same kind of dumb comedy, something I normally really dislike. And it's funny because in certain ways that still turned out to be true, but TT just does everytthing - even the dumb stuff - just right!\n\n- I knew it was considered a classic but I wasn't that interested in seeing **Thelma &amp; Louise** honestly for no good reason other than I just didn't think it was going to stand the test of time that well. But, yea, I was very wrong, this is a great movie.\n\n- I normally don't like a lot of 80s horror so I hadn't seen **The Thing** for quite some time. But this is a classic for a very good reason.\n\nWhat are some for you? I'm curious about movies that you really didn't think you'd like, and why, only to be proved wrong.",

        "content": "I\u2019ve long been a follower of David Lynch and his work, which I would describe as a masterful blend of the surreal, the unsettling, and the beautifully strange. His ability to weave together vivid imagery and enigmatic storytelling is unmatched, creating films that linger in the mind like fragments of a dream.\n\nThe first Lynch film I watched was Blue Velvet. I was quite blown away by it - the visuals were utterly hypnotic, pulling me into a world that was both haunting and beautiful. That film opened the door for me to explore the rest of his work, from his experimental beginnings with Eraserhead to his later, more polished work.\n\nLynch\u2019s films weren\u2019t always easy to follow for me. The narratives often felt fragmented, like dreams where disconnected stories play out, each fascinating on its own yet not necessarily tied together in conventional ways. Lost Highway is a perfect example of this, and for me, it stands out as one of his best - equal parts haunting and mesmerizing.\n\nBut my favorite Lynch film has to be Mulholland Drive. Even though I saw it over a decade ago, it\u2019s still etched vividly in my memory. The colors, the set pieces, and the haunting atmosphere were breathtaking. Scenes like the dirty homeless man\u2019s reveal or the blue box remain some of the most chilling and thought-provoking moments I\u2019ve ever experienced in cinema. They perfectly encapsulate Lynch\u2019s ability to make the unreal feel viscerally real.\n\nLynch was undoubtedly an unusual director, one whose work wasn\u2019t everyone\u2019s cup of tea. But for those of us who appreciated his unique vision, he leaves behind a legacy that is quite unforgettable\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hphnoe9mjhde1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5465c1ace24376a188036b91a73085d53072266\n\n",
