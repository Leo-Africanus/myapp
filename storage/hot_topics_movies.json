And with the aid of ***Wicked*** and ***Gladiator II***, it was the busiest weekend of the year.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $269.2 million this weekend ($412.8 million five-day). That's not just a colossal 210% up from last year, but it's also the biggest Thanksgiving weekend ever.\n\nDebuting on top, ***Moana 2*** earned a colossal $139.7 million in 4,200 theaters. Adding its numbers from Wednesday, the debut rises to $225.4 million in five days. It broke so many records, including the biggest debut for a Walt Disney Animation Studios film debut, as well as the highest Thanksgiving weekend. But most importantly; it beat ***The Super Mario Bros. Movie*** ($204.6 million) for the biggest Wednesday-to-Sunday debut. \n\nA fantastic debut all around, and it shouldn't be a surprise. If you've followed the Top 10 charts on streaming, you'll find that ***Moana*** has been one of the most streamed films in the past years. It was even reported that it was the most streamed film across all services last year. Needless to say, ***Moana*** became far more popular with years, and audiences hoped for a sequel to come.\n\nDisney, for some reason, was interested in doing it but only as a TV show for Disney+. In February 2024, it was revealed that the show was retooled into a film that would hit theaters this Thanksgiving. With an extensive marketing campaign, Disney successfully got people into giving this film a chance. \n\nAccording to Disney, 65% of the audience was female, and 60% was 18 and over. Critics were not enthused with the film, and it currently sits at 64% on RT. The audience was more forgiving, giving it an \"A\u2013\" on CinemaScore, although that falls on the lower end of WDAS titles. There are no animated titles on its way until ***Dog Man*** in January, so it can leg out through the holidays. $500 million is pretty much guaranteed, and can go as high as $600 million if it can hold very well.\n\nAfter defying gravity on its opening weekend, ***Wicked*** continued flying high. It earned $81.1 million this weekend ($118.2 million five-day). That marks an insane 28% drop, which breaks the record set by ***Top Gun: Maverick*** (29%) as the smallest drop for a $100+ million opener. Of course, ***Maverick*** achieved that record on the weekend after Memorial Day, but it didn't face a $100+ million opener on its second weekend.\n\nThrough ten days, ***Wicked*** has earned a colossal $263.1 million domestically. It's already the highest grossing Broadway musical adaptation, passing ***Grease*** ($188 million). Of course, ***Grease*** is still ahead in terms of adjusted inflation ($770 million), but ***Wicked*** remains a colossal success. It should hit $400 million without any problem, and the holidays can help it get close to $500 million by the end of its run.\n\nParamount's ***Gladiator II*** added $31 million this weekend. That represents a 44% drop, which is fine, but not fantastic considering how well the other holdovers did. Through 10 days, Ridley Scott's sequel has earned $111.4 million, passing ***Robin Hood*** and ***Black Hawk Down*** to become Scott's 6th highest grossing film domestically. The film should finish with over $150 million domestically, quite down from the original's $187 million lifetime gross.\n\nAfter a steep second weekend drop, Amazon MGM's ***Red One*** eased a light 4%, adding $12.7 million this weekend. The film has earned $75.8 million so far, and depending on next week's drop, it could still hit $100 million. Although it's hard to call this a bonafide hit considering its colossal $250 million budget.\n\nLionsgate's ***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever*** was still on the Top 5, easing just 6% and adding $3.2 million. The film has earned $31.9 million domestically.\n\nIn sixth place, Angel Studios' ***Bonhoeffer: Pastor. Spy. Assassin*** fell 54% and added $2.3 million this weekend ($3.3 million five-day). That's a very weak drop, especially considering it had Thanksgiving. Through ten days, the film has amassed $9.6 million and will close with less than $15 million.\n\n***Venom: The Last Dance*** is still holding well, dipping 43% this weekend and adding $2.2 million. The film has amassed $137.8 million so far, which is still far behind the previous ***Venom*** films.\n\nA24's ***Heretic*** continues falling. This weekend, it fell 57% and added $956K this weekend. With $26.8 million in the bank, it's now gonna finish below $30 million.\n\nIn the face of ***Moana 2***, DreamWorks' ***The Wild Robot*** had its worst drop yet. It collapsed 67% this weekend, adding $700,000 to its run. The film has earned $142.5 million, and it's nearing the end of its run.\n\nRounding up the Top 10 was Searchlight's ***A Real Pain***, which recovered after its weak drop last weekend. The film dipped 39%, grossing $655,910 this weekend. The film has earned just $6.1 million, and barring some huge Oscar noms, it looks like it might miss $10 million.\n\nOutside the Top 10 was Focus Features' ***Conclave***, which dipped 46% and earned $616,955 this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $30.1 million domestically. A damn great run for an adult drama.\n\nNeon's ***Anora*** is winding down, and it's now playing in just 230 theaters. This weekend, it dipped 43% and added $385,292. Its domestic total stands at $12.7 million.\n\nA24 debuted Luca Guadagnino's ***Queer*** in 7 theaters, earning $188,808. That translates to a $26,973 per-theater average, which is quite middling (it barely cracks the top 20 highest PTA of the year). For comparison, it's barely above ***Bones and All*** ($24,201), and far below ***Suspiria*** ($92,019) and ***Call Me By Your Name*** ($103,233). The film will continue expanding through the holidays.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\nThe records don't stop just in America for ***Moana 2***.\n\n***Moana 2*** debuted with a colossal $163 million overseas, which means it debuted with $389.2 million worldwide. That broke ***Mario***'s record ($377 million) for the biggest animated debut in history. The biggest markets were France ($18.8M), UK ($15.5M), Mexico ($11.1M), Germany ($10.5M), Italy ($9.3M), South Korea ($9.1M), Australia ($8.3M), Brazil ($7.5M), China ($6.5M) and Spain ($5.5M). An easy billion right here, ladies and gentlemen. \n\n***Wicked*** is a monster hit domestically, but that popularity hasn't fully connected with the rest of the world. This weekend, the film earned $29 million from the overseas markets, taking the worldwide total to $360.3 million. It's still killing it in the UK ($36M) and Australia ($12.9M), and it has performed well in South Korea ($8.5M), Mexico ($6.7M), and Philippines ($3.5M). The rest of the markets... not so much. While it still has some markets left, the film will be domestic-heavy. The film is cleary a hit, but it's crazy how the domestic market represents a huge 73% of its worldwide gross.\n\n***Gladiator II*** added $27.2 million this weekend, and its worldwide total is now $320.2 million. The best markets are the UK ($29.7M), France ($22.5M), Spain ($15M), Mexico ($12.9M) and Australia ($11.5M). The film should pass the original's $272 million foreign gross, but it's unlikely it can pass its worldwide gross ($460 million).\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Beetlejuice Beetlejuice* | Sep/6 | Warner Bros. | $111,003,345 | $294,100,435 | $450,053,961 | $100M\n*Saturday Night* | Sep/27 | Sony | $3,400,583 | $9,509,312 | $9,752,378 | $25M\n*Terrifier 3* | Oct/11 | Cineverse | $18,928,113 | $53,981,071 | $94,436,616 | $2M\n\n- 36 years in the making and it paid off, as ***Beetlejuice Beetlejuice*** closed with a fantastic $294 million domestically, finishing as Burton's second highest grossing film, just a little behind ***Alice in Wonderland*** ($334 million). Interestingly, that popularity wasn't as strong overseas, as the domestic market represented 65.3% of its worldwide gross. It's still a great $450 million worldwide, although ***Alice*** ($1 billion) and ***Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*** ($474 million) finished far higher. Despite a few duds here and there, Tim Burton is still as popular as he's ever been.\n\n- ***Saturday Night Live*** might be popular 50 years later, but that doesn't mean the audience is interested in a film depicting its first ever broadcast. That was the case for Jason Reitman's ***Saturday Night***, which closed with a very poor $9.5 million domestically. The film was positioned as an Oscars contender, but the film fizzled out by the time it hit wide release and faded quickly. Don't expect the rest of the world to save it, given that ***Saturday Night Live*** isn't as popular as the States. \n\n- Last month, we had two movies revolving around a clown as its protagonist. ***Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux*** became one of the worst received comic book films of all time, allowing Art the Clown to emerge as the winner of the month. And now, ***Terrifier 3*** has closed with a damn fantastic $94 million worldwide, making it the highest grossing unrated film ever. Shattered the ceilling of what a film like this could achieve, and elevating Art to one of the most iconic horror villains of modern times. Damien Leone has already confirmed a fourth film is coming up. Art in space when?\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nThe post-Thanksgiving weekend is usually a dumping ground for studios. With the Christmas season kicking off, people are busy, which is why studios avoid releasing anything big. It's up to the small films to get a chance. This weekend, we have two newcomers and none of them stand a chance in dethroning ***Moana 2***. None will even touch $10 million this weekend.\n\nThe only one with a confirmed wide release is A24's ***Y2K***, which marks Kyle Mooney's debut as writer and director. The film stars Jaeden Martell, Julian Dennison, Rachel Zegler, Fred Durst, and Alicia Silverstone, and depicts an imaginative version of the Year 2000 problem, where a bug causes all technology to come to life and turn against humanity. The film has received mixed reviews (63% on RT), and horror comedies have not performed well as of late. We'll see how it does, but a debut under A24's ***Heretic*** ($10.8 million) seems pretty much imminent.\n\nThe other film, although in far less theaters, is Searchlight's ***Nightbitch***. A film that stars Amy Adams as a mother who transforms into a dog. Like, seriously. Y'all complain about lack of originality in Hollywood? Well, here's a very unique premise. Reviews are quite similar to ***Y2K***, and marketing has been very limited so far. This suggests it won't be a very wide release.\n\nAnd for those curious, Christopher Nolan's ***Interstellar*** is returning to theaters this Friday for a limited time on IMAX screens. You should hurry up, for screenings are quickly getting sold out.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice, where a slightly altered version of this write-up can be found.",

        "content": "'Nosferatu' - Review Thread\n\n* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/nosferatu_2024) \\- 93% (57 Reviews)\n* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/nosferatu-2024/) \\- 83 (24 Reviews)\n\nReviews:\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-lily-rose-depp-1236222769/):\n\n&gt;Visually striking as it is, with compositions that rival great Flemish paintings, the obsessive director\u2019s somber retelling of F.W. Murnau\u2019s expressionistic vampire movie is commendably faithful to the 1922 silent film and more accessible than \u201cThe Lighthouse\u201d and \u201cThe Witch,\u201d yet eerily drained of life.\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-lily-rose-depp-nicholas-hoult-gothic-vampire-romance-1236191438/):\n\n&gt;Nosferatu may not click instantly, but, aside from the technical brilliance that superbly renders the late-19th century, there\u2019s a baked-in longevity in its thinking that will surely keep people coming back.\n\n[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/nosferatu-review-bill-skarsgard-lily-rose-depp-nicholas-hoult-robert-eggers-1236074321/) (100):\n\n&gt;Every age gets its definitive film of Stoker\u2019s vampire legend. Eggers has given us a magnificent version for today with roots that stretch back a century.\n\n[Collider ](https://collider.com/nosferatu-2024-review/)(9/10):\n\n&gt;Nosferatu shows Robert Eggers at the height of his powers, building an atmosphere of choking menace anchored by magnificent turns from Lily-Rose Depp and Bill Skarsgard.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-bill-skarsgard-dracula/):\n\n&gt;Robert Eggers may not have rewritten the book of \u201cNosferatu,\u201d and much of the film plays more like an update than a wholly new take, but he does justice to this material. And he does more than justice to Orlock: Eggers and Skarsg\u00e5rd give him new (un)life, empowering him in ways that make all the rest of us feel powerless.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-lily-rose-depp-1235071494/) (A-):\n\n&gt;Eggers\u2019 broadly suggestive script doesn\u2019t put too fine a point on the specifics of Ellen\u2019s repression, but Depp\u2019s revelatory performance ensures that the rest of the movie doesn\u2019t have to.\n\n[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/nosferatu-2024/) (4/5):\n\n&gt;Despite its familiar story beats, Eggers\u2019 retelling suffocates like a coffin, right up to its chilling final shot. Lily-Rose Depp is full-bloodedly committed, and Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd\u2019s fiend gorges with terrible fury.\n\n[Bloody-Disgusting](https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3847134/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-macabre-masterpiece/) (5/5):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s operatic and dramatic, bold and revolting, with a powerful final shot for the ages. And Eggers\u2019 *Nosferatu* happens to be set over Christmas. That all but ensures this macabre masterpiece is destined to become a new holiday horror classic.\n\n[Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/horror-movies/nosferatu-review/) (4/5):\n\n&gt;Nosferatu delivers a relatively straight re-telling of this classic gothic tale. It looks and sounds stunning and is packed with vampiric horror. It doesn't push many boundaries but if you wanted the classic Dracula narrative feeling exactly like it\u2019s directed by Robert Eggers, you're going to love it.\n\n[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/nosferatu-review?utm_source=threads,twitter) (9/10):\n\n&gt;Nosferatu is Robert Eggers' finest work, given how it both boldly stands on its own as a gothic vampire drama and astutely taps into the original texts \u2014 F.W. Murnau's silent classic and Bram Stoker's novel Dracula.\n\nThe Independent (100):\n\n&gt;Depp does magnificent work in embodying the sense of existing out of place, not only in the violent contortions and grimaces of supernatural possession, but in the way Ellen\u2019s gaze seems to look out beyond her conversation partner and into some undefinable abyss.\n\nWritten and Directed by Robert Eggers:\n\n&gt;*Nosferatu* is a gothic tale of obsession between a haunted young woman and the terrifying vampire infatuated with her, causing untold horror in its wake.\n\nRelease Date: December 25\n\nCast:\n\n* Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd as Count Orlok\n* Nicholas Hoult as Thomas Hutter\n* Lily-Rose Depp as Ellen Hutter\n* Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Friedrich Harding\n* Emma Corrin as Anna Harding\n* Willem Dafoe as Prof. Albin Eberhart Von Franz\n* Ralph Ineson as Dr. Wilhelm Sievers\n* Simon McBurney as Herr Knock",

Is the accent noticeable?\nWhich ones you didn't know about and which ones were obvious?\n\nI'm interested in your pov.",

More like you choosing to pause the movie at a particular scene because it's revealing in some way interesting or revelatory or funny. Basically scenes that contain details you may miss the first time viewing.\n\nFor example there is that famous head splitting scene from T2 that you need to freeze the frame to see. Guy's head splits before being shot at. [https://i.imgur.com/cWZlQCg.png](https://i.imgur.com/cWZlQCg.png)\n\nBut I prefer more focus on interesting details in scenes than \"mistakes.\"\n\nLike in Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut, there are several scenes that need to be freezed, such as one involving Tom reading the paper. Sort of easter egg hunt thing.\n\nDo you have any you like to share?",

        "content": "I grew up watching \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\", it was among my favorite childhood films. It was entertaining, engrossing, funny, thrilling and even moving. \n\nAs engaging and charismatic as the Turtles were, April O'Neil, their human friend, wasn't sidelined as the \"token chick\". April had her own agency, she was smart and spunky and funny while never taking the spotlight away from the Turtles. She also had a romantic subplot with Casey Jones, played by Elias Koteas, and their scenes together sizzle with humorous chemistry. \n\nI liked Judith Hoag a lot, she'll always be April O'Neil. Unfortunately, Judith Hoag didn't return, she got recast with Paige Turco for the sequels and unlike Hoag, Turco was more supporting instead of a co-lead. Turco wasn't bad, she did the best with what she got, yet Hoag had a charm which was lacking in Turco's April. \n\nI've never found a proper reason of why Hoag didn't return. The most I got was Hoag quit because she disapproved of the \"violence\" in the film, which I don't get. It's a martial arts film about antromorphic Turtles, she wasn't given the script for \"Teletubbies\".",

        "content": "It was in my watchlist for such a long time, finally decided to watch it and blew me away completely. John Carpenter is a visionary! Has anyone of you saw it in the theatres? Or were you there when it was released?\n\nHave you seen Men In Black or The Matrix or Fight Club? This movie felt like it had all of that! And maybe somewhat an inspiration for the movie I mentioned.\n\nThey Live dir. By *John Carpenter* is a story of a man, played by Roddy Piper who has come to City in search of a job, but is shocked when he sees the _*reality of this world*_. There are aliens living among us, and they are controlling everything.\n\nAdvertisements, News Channels, Politics, everything... everything is a LIE. They are controlling us with different mediums, changing our Subconscious mind and bending our reality, turning us into servants, into Livestock. \n\n_\"We are Sleeping, They are living.\"_\n\nIf you're someone who is into Illuminati, Secret Society, you'll love this film.\n\nThough some moments felt janky in acting, but that's because the lead is probably the first WWF Turned Actor. Also there is this lovely action scene which was EXHAUSTING (in a good way) because how real it felt.\n\nThis movie is more than relevant today ever before. Because we see so many influencers and internet personalities talking nonsense and even turning the real point.\n\nThe runtime is about 1hr 30mins, and even if you watch this type of films or not, you should watch it just for the concept.",

Then at the end\u2026 they are both in a relationship where they fight a lot.. both have been unfaithful and she\u2019s ready to turn him in. But when she sees his innocent genuine smile when he sees her, she can\u2019t bring herself to go against him and realizes she still loves him despite all their issues and signals to him to run away. I loved that dynamic\n\nAlso the part where the Dennis Heybert\u2019s character (the AllState commercial guy) is sitting with his gf and he feels like a failure. He tells her \u201cwhy you rolling around with me for?\u201d and starts crying. And she reassures him and tells him because she\u2019s proud of him for trying. \n\n2 scenes/dynamics that are relatable and just hit deep. One is a relationship that has had many issues and in turmoil but deep down, the two still love eachother. The other is a man who feels like he can\u2019t offer nothing and the woman is reassuring him that he is enough.",
