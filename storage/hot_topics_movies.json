I wrote and directed RABBIT TRAP, a psychological folk-horror that premiered at Sundance last year and that will be out in UK cinemas this weekend via Picturehouse Entertainment. It stars Dev Patel &amp; Rosy McEwen, and I'm here to answer your questions.\n\n**Synopsis:**\n\nIn 1976, married musicians Daphne (Rosy McEwen) and Darcy Davenport (Dev Patel) move to the Welsh countryside to finish their new record. While making field recordings in the ancient woodlands, Darcy captures a forbidden sound not meant for human ears. This brings a strange boy to their doorstep who draws them into an enigmatic realm where the line between reality and myth begins to blur.\n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y953Fl\\_BdWM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y953Fl_BdWM)\n\nStarring Dev Patel &amp; Rosy McEwen.

        "content": "I watced a video recently about a Korean war horror movie called R Point, which is about a group of Korean soldiers being sent to find and rescue a group of missing soldiers from a place called R Point during the war...\n\nThey reach the place, and soon weird things begin to happen. A giant factory like building appears out of nowhere one morning, one soldier sees the ghosts of another platoon, while a few American soldiers warn the troop that the place is haunted, and their radio begins to play weird screams...\n\nOne morning, they find one of the members of the troop dead and report it to HQ. But in response they're informed that &gt;! this \"dead troop member\" is actually one of the guys from the missing troop that they were sent to find!&lt; \n\nThe twist isn't grand or whatnot, but it's the way they hide it right in front of the audience that amazed me. For over 50 minutes they showed the twist and nobody could've guessed it. A good example of how atmosphere and execution can make even a predictable twist unpredictable...\n\nWhat are some other plot twists cleverly hidden in plain sight..?",

        "content": "Hey, Reddit! I\u2019m Sook-Yin Lee! You may know me from Shortbus, Hedwig and the Angry Inch, or as a musician &amp; ex-MuchMusic VJ. My new movie, PAYING FOR IT, a live-action feature film adaptation of cartoonist Chester Brown\u2019s best-selling graphic novel, opens in theaters: NYC 1/30, L.A. 2/3 &amp; more. AMA!\n\n**Official Trailer**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqPfF1lxRxw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqPfF1lxRxw)\n\n**More Information**: [https://filmmovement.com/paying-for-it](https://filmmovement.com/paying-for-it)\n\n**ABOUT PAYING FOR IT**\n\nSet in the late 90\u2019s, PAYING FOR IT follows the trials and travails of Chester (Dan Beirne), a cartoonist and Sonny (Emily L\u00ea), a TV host, who are in a long-term, committed, romantic relationship. When Sonny introduces the idea of opening up their relationship, Chester begins sleeping with sex workers, forcing him to face his issues with intimacy and romance in the process. Based on the best-selling graphic novel by acclaimed alternative-cartoonist Chester Brown, PAYING FOR IT is a \u201cprovocative, hilarious and heartfelt\u201d (The Globe and Mail) personal take on romance and relationships. From writer/director Sook-Yin Lee, the film \u201cdisplays a maturity and thoughtfulness (...) in the messy contradictions we may hold about love\u201d (RogerEbert.com).  Celebrating the vibrant underground comic and zine era through the experiences of cartoonist Brown, PAYING FOR IT connects the past with the present by bringing together emerging comic actors, performance artists, authors, activists and multimedia creators in front of and behind the camera, and it has resonated for festival audiences and critics alike.\n\n**ABOUT SOOK-YIN LEE**\n\nSook-Yin Lee (Writer, Director, Co-Producer) is a Toronto-based filmmaker, musician, actor and broadcaster (CBC, BBC, MuchMusic). She starred in Shortbus, the ground-breaking 2SLGBTQ movie directed by John Cameron Mitchell that premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. Her feature film writer and directorial debut, Year of the Carnivore, starring Cristin Milioti, premiered at TIFF. In 2014, Lee won the Canadian Screen Award for Best Performance by a Lead Dramatic Actress in Jack and went on to write and perform Unsafe for Canadian Stage, which examined questions of censorship and artistic freedom. She won Best Director and Best Picture at the 2018 Downtown Los Angeles Film Festival for Octavio is Dead! --a ghost story starring Sarah Gadon and Rosanna Arquette. Death and Sickness, her feature movie made with Dylan Gamble, streams on CBC Gem. She acts in Darkest Miriam, executive produced by Charlie Kaufman, and is set to release her experimental comedy Rest and Relax. Sook-Yin is a music recording artist and film score composer. She contributed songs to Brandon Cronenberg's horror movies Infinity Pool and Antiviral.\n\nAsk me anything r/movies! I'll be back tomorrow, Thursday 1/29 at 3 PM ET, to answer your questions.\n\n",

        "content": "i recently watched 1997's galaxy quest. since i'm a star trek fan, my older relatives have been recommending that i watch this movie for quite some time. i've always heard that galaxy quest was ahead of it's time in it's portrayal of geek culture and i was reluctant when i heard that it was a satire of geek culture. when i hear the words \"satire of geek culture\", i imagine a work that portrays geeks as pathetic man children who take media way too seriously and need to get a life. sure, there's plenty of that in geek culture but that's a minority and not the rule.\n\nhowever, my curiosity finally peaked and i decided to give it a watch. and it's a very funny movie with a fascinating story(even if it is just the plot of three amigos but with a star trek expy). and, despite my fears, the film's portrayal of geek culture is one of my favorite aspects of the film.\n\nlike i said, the film is a satire of geek culture, specifically trekkies. and the film largely portrays geek culture very positively. the geeks in the film are passionate about galaxy quest and knowledgeable about the lore. and, in the end, it's both of those things that end up saving the day. the film also does take lighthearted jabs at geeks, such as mocking the social awkwardness of some nerds and the intense obsession that some of them have. however, as i watched the film, i got the vibe that the filmmakers were laughing WITH me and not AT me. of course, it also helps that i have a pretty thick skin when it comes to jokes at my expense.\n\nif you think about it, the film is less of a satire of geek culture and more of an affectionate parody that's more than willing to make fun of it but is also willing to acknowledge the good parts and that, at the end of the day, geek culture is a good thing.",

So would that loss Louis and Ian experience be worth the journey? You never know until youre there in that moment of time.\n\nYoull always have those memories, but they become moments in the stream of life that you remember. Not a linear path, because youll recall them at different times and phases of your life. What a wonderful way to approach it.\n",

        "content": "So I just watched Interstellar for the first time, yes I understand it\u2019s 2026, I just now got around to it. I was completely hooked on it, I loved everything about it and was super interested as I\u2019ve always been quite intrigued by physics, however, him in the black hole and everything after that kind of messed it all up for me. My main thing is that, if we see him communicating with his past daughter (and his past self), then wouldn\u2019t this entire thing all just be a loop anyways? He\u2019s communicating with the past, so then that past version of himself would continue on to go on the same journey, and then communicate with ANOTHER past version of himself. I understand that the past watch he tinkered with led his present daughter to solving everything (which I wish we got more of an explanation of), but what about the past daughter he had communicated with? Is that just its own alternate timeline that will lead to the same result? And then also, was the tesseract in the black hole created by a whole other future civilization for the sole purpose of allowing him to communicate with his past daughter, allowing her to save humanity?? So, a future 5 dimensional civilization builds a structure for a past 3 dimensional civilization so that a man can communicate even further into the past to allow for the future existence of their own civilization. Sorry I\u2019m a bit slow.",

        "content": "I love the Tron movies\n\nThe three movies are actually all very good for what they are, and are classic works of Sci Fi, in my opinion. \n\nThe first movie is a bit dated now, but I still have a soft spot for it.  It's got that wonderful retro science fiction design, with the line drawings that make it look a bit like a video games from that era.  I know that was the idea, but ot gives me a lot of nostalgia when I watch it now.\n\nThe second one is actually a classic science fiction/fantasy theme in a lot of book series.  The first book being about a main character, then the second being set years later and being about their descendants.  I also love the look and music from the film.  I think it holds up very well today, and is in many ways superior to the first.\n\nI also really enjoyed the 3rd movie, and I honestly didn't think I would.  Again, it just feels like classic science fiction and has a really solid story.\n\nWatching them really does take me back to my childhood when I would play in my parents garage and read old science books, comics and play with puzzles.  I just get such huge nostalgia from all 3, and they actually make ne think about my Dad a lot.  When I was young my Dad was really into reading fantasy and science fiction, and he'd let me read it, too, then we'd talk about the books.  He also loved Tron and I know he would love the 2 follow ups.\n\nAnyway, that's why I love those movies.\n\nWhat do you think?",
