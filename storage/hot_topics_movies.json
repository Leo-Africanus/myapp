Brad Pitt at his most beautiful, breathtaking scenery, family sagas, gorgeous score, all that. I love them both and have watched them more than a few times and I still expect scenes from one to show up in the other, and I get confused when they don't!\n\nDo you have any movies like this, where you conflate them both even though you know they're not the same?",

        "content": "Edward Jessup (William Hurt) is a scientist and psychology professor who decides to combine his experiments in sensory deprivation tanks with powerful hallucinogenic drugs, convinced that it may help him unlock different states of consciousness. The experiments are a success at first, but as Jessup continues his work, he begins to experience altered mental and also physical states. As he spends more time in sensory deprivation, his grip on reality begins to slip away. I loved this movie, for a film in 1980 it was WAY ahead of it\u2019s time. The film is really good, intense, weird and trippy. William Hurt did a good job portraying Eddie a very likable interesting character who has these states of consciousness and wants to fight them off. Very good practical effects when he becomes a caveman and good makeup that was done. His character Eddie and his wife Emily (Blair Brown) have some good chemistry with each other. Bob Balaban who plays Arthur researches Eddie and monitors him while he is in these tanks. If you haven\u2019t seen the film it\u2019s a good interesting watch.",

        "content": "The \"Wilhem scream\" was first used in the 1951 movie Distand Drums. It was then used as an inside joke by Ben Burtt the movie sound designer on the first Star Wars film in 1977. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/mpE0XxBCtOc?si=gS9gNklxTQjw1vPp\n\nI remember hearing it in a large amount of movies all throughout my life. It always used to make me sort of chuckle to myself and say \"Oh wow they used that crazy scream again.\" I even had to explain to my GF what the scream was and show her some examples. Now almost every movie we watch that has the scream in it we willl look at each other and just smirk and roll our eyes at the moment. \n\nWhat makes me bring it up today though is I was watching The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and they used the scream THREE times in the movie. I am not saying it ruined the movie for me in any way (The Hobbit movies are kinda meh imo) but it really just pulls me out of any movie I hear it in. I know is is a joke used by sound designers as it is just an over the top ridiculous scream. I just wish it was not used as frequently. ",

Despite appearing in only 16 minutes of the film, he\u2019s a fully fleshed-out character, so to speak. \n\nI was watching it the other day and noticed an extra bit of characterization that I hadn\u2019t caught before. Spoilers to follow. When Clarice comes to see him the first time at the asylum, she comments on one of the drawings in his cell. He explains that it depicts the Duomo as seen from the Belvedere in Florence. The drawings are never mentioned again and we are left to assume that it was just a way to demonstrate that he is well-traveled, a talented artist, and possesses a sharp memory. Just a very efficient piece of character exposition.\n\nUntil we get to the end of the movie. After following the clues that Hannibal left in her case file, Clarice finds herself in Belvedere, Ohio. With only newspaper articles, Hannibal figured out the identity of Buffalo Bill and told no one! Aside from all of the other ways that Hannibal Lecter embodies evil, this is a perfect demonstration. Evil but perhaps not completely inhuman. He doesn\u2019t help Clarice with her investigation because he wants a killer to be caught, but because a naive young woman was kind to him. \n\nSuch a great movie",
