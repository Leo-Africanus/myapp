        "content": "Roger Ebert had this great quote about movies and watching them at different points in your life. Presented in full below.\n\n\u201cMovies do not change, but their viewers do. When I saw La Dolce Vita in 1960, I was an adolescent for whom \u201cthe sweet life\u201d represented everything I dreamed of: sin, exotic European glamor, the weary romance of the cynical newspaperman. When I saw it again, around 1970, I was living in a version of Marcello\u2019s world; Chicago\u2019s North Avenue was not the Via Veneto, but at 3 a.m. the denizens were just as colorful, and I was about Marcello\u2019s age.\n\nWhen I saw the movie around 1980, Marcello was the same age, but I was 10 years older, had stopped drinking, and saw him not as a role model but as a victim, condemned to an endless search for happiness that could never be found, not that way. By 1991, when I analyzed the film a frame at a time at the University of Colorado, Marcello seemed younger still, and while I had once admired and then criticized him, now I pitied and loved him. And when I saw the movie right after Mastroianni died, I thought that Fellini and Marcello had taken a moment of discovery and made it immortal.\u201d\n\n\\*\\*\n\nWhat are some movies that had this effect on you? Based on a previous discussion, 500 Days of Summer was one for me. When I first watched it, I just got out of a serious relationship, and Tom resonated with me. Rewatching it with some time, I realized Tom was flawed, and he was putting Summer on a pedestal and not seeing her as a person.\n\nDiscuss away!\n\n",

        "content": "My dad always does something I've only ever heard of people occasionally doing. No matter what movie or TV show he's watching at home, he will get up in the middle of it and with zero urgency, go to the bathroom, grab food, look out the window, or do any number of random things, all without pausing.  He'll then sit back down having missed 5-20 minutes without saying a word and never asks questions after the movie. \n\nIt used to drive me nuts when I lived at home over a decade ago and recently I stayed over one night and watched him do the same thing.  My mom doesn't even bother asking if she should pause. \n\nQuality doesn't matter either. It could be the greatest movie he's ever seen, but he'll still miss 10 minutes of it doing whatever. I've seen him take out the garbage, cook popcorn on the stovetop, and even fold laundry in another room all while a movie he wanted to watch was playing. \n\nThis is insane right? I understand not being in to a movie and getting bored, but in my 30+ years I've never seen or heard of him sitting through an entire movie.  This is the same guy who can sit on the porch for an hour or two doing nothing. I don't understand. \n\nTo be clear, I'm not trying to change him or anything. I just truly don't understand and want to see if anyone else knows someone like this.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n****EDIT**** People keep saying it's about spending time with others or not wanting to interrupt. It's just my mom and dad at home, and if they disagree on what to watch she'll go upstairs to watch something while he watches what he wants alone....but still gets up without pausing.",

Something especially notable was how men interacted with each other, being sensitive toward each other and openly expressing their emotions, crying lots of times. It was a refreshing departure from American media where I honestly just don't see anything like it happening. \n\nTypical gender norms sadden me. It's like years of cultural norms have stunted people's growth in so many ways when they otherwise could be processing their emotions in more authentic and likely healthier ways. Here in GMO you see companionship and empathy and it really displays an openness to the way the characters functioned as people. It was almost off-putting, yet their actions would perhaps be true to life, under those circumstances. ",

Kieran received an actual oscar??? has anyone else had a moment where the universe just casually threw a personal plot twist at them like this? do you know if I can somehow talk to Jesse? what is going on?",

        "content": "The term \"media literacy\" is often brought up in modern fiction discussion. It refers to the viewer's ability to decipher what the author actually really meant to say with their work, and what should be the \"correct\" interpretation of it.\n\nBut most if not all examples of such works are ones where most people end up idolizing a certain character, but the whole point is supposed to be that you shouldn't idolize them. (Some examples being Tyler Durden in *Fight Club,* Patrick Bateman in *American Psycho* for some reason, Travis Bickle in *Taxi Driver,* etc. For works other than movies, I personally would also add Raskoljnikov from *Crime and Punishment* on that list.)\n\nAre there any movies that might be testing some different kind of media literacy, other than the aforementioned one? I personally can't think of any.",

        "content": "Something i realized about Ferris Bueller's Day Off when I rewatched last night (great movie, as always, btw) is that Ferris doesn't actually have a character arc in the movie. Yes, he is the title character and the main POV throughout most of the film, but he doesn't have a clear character arc.\n\nIf anything, Cameron Fray, Ferris friend does. At the start of the film, Cameron is in bed sickly and not really confident in himself, but as the movie progresses, he starts to get more confidence, and by the end, he gains the courage to stand up to his father. \n\nIt's kindof wholesome, actually.",

It may not look like being overweight but drugs anger depression terrible mental health. I don't think he's ever gotten over the fact that his children's mother left them and along the way he's made so many mistakes so much that he feels like he can't come back from them and he'll die thinking that way. And just like how Charlie thinks that his daughter is the best thing that he's ever done I think my dad thinks same way but when you mess something up so much it's almost too shameful too difficult to try to come back from it. Unfortunately the child's perspective you don't really give a fuck you just want your dad you just want your mom and we can just figure out the rest. But at the end of the day they're just people trying to figure out life and love and sometimes it's just too hard. Idk it's got me in my feels. Just had to get this out. \n",

        "content": "Though not without some 80s cheese (some of the acting and dialogue can be rough), its flaws are forgiven for the sheer ambition. Think this movie handles momentum and impending doom as well as any horror film and the slow burn approach really works in its favour. \n\nI love horror films but I find very few of them to be truly unsettling. Sequences in Prince of Darkness just freak me out, though. Those recurring dream messages from the future with the distorted voice and low-budget VHS footage get under my skin, and the \u201cYOU WILL NOT BE SAVED!\u201d scene is just a masterclass of tension. \n\nI also think it has an all-timer ending. The dream sequence repeats once more and the ambiguity of it all (you\u2019re not sure if the evil is still out there or not) is so well done. Prime example of show, don\u2019t tell.\n\nWhile The Thing is the superior film, Prince of Darkness is scarier IMO. What do you all think of the movie? ",
