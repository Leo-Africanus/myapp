        "title": "Finally watched \"Requiem for a Dream\" after years of putting it off. I just feel empty inside.",
        "content": "Watching the gradual deterioration of the characters is a ride as it feels like you are there with them but feel hopeless unable to help. The ending montage accelerates like a nightmare in real time, and I couldn't quite process what I was seeing. It happens so fast, that while what was happening was horrifying, I just felt like I was numb to it. Trapped in an endless cycle too.\n\nThe real horror of this movie isn't the uncanny visuals. I was really freaked out by how grounded in realism it all is. Characters become unrecognizable and do depressingly repetitive tasks and chores. It is so much a reflection of real life, that while I was disturbed, I find myself just feeling that's just how life goes for some.\n\nEllen Burstyn's monologue about being alone and wanting to matter was the highlight. It floored me. Got the ultimate point of the movie across better than the surreal images.\n\n\"I'm somebody now, Harry. Everybody likes me. Soon, millions of people will see me and they'll all like me. I'll tell them about you, and your father, how good he was to us. Remember? It's a reason to get up in the morning. It's a reason to lose weight, to fit in the red dress. It's a reason to smile. It makes tomorrow all right. What have I got Harry, hm? Why should I even make the bed, or wash the dishes? I do them, but why should I? I'm alone. Your father's gone, you're gone. I got no one to care for. What have I got, Harry? I'm lonely. I'm old.\"\n\nAfter watching it, I get why people are uncomfortable by it. I do believe it is brilliantly made and \"Requiem for a Dream\" should be required viewing because we could make drugs obsolete in no time. But I will never watch it again!",

The Dino action scenes are filled with tension ( the trick with the phone is well done) and the whole thing wraps up in a neat 90 mins.\n\nSam Neil really reminds me why he is my favorite character in the series. Dr Grant is calm, experienced and has his shit together.\n\nYeah, the lower quality CGI shows as well. But I think it mostly looks okay.",

I recently just bought the movie on dvd and I\u2019m glad to have a movie like this in my collection. Not only is the cast full of amazing actors (Kurt Russel, Sam Elliot, Val Kilmer and Bill Paxton, R.I.P. to both of them) but the acting and the plot are so good. The famous lines \u201cI\u2019m your Huckleberry\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s the rumor\u201d, Morgan taking his last breath on the pool table. Wyatt getting his revenge. Billy Bob Thorton getting smacked and Stephen Lang being almost unrecognizable. It\u2019s truly sad that movies like this aren\u2019t made anymore. Like I mentioned before, I\u2019ve seen this movie so many times and it always feels like I\u2019m watching it for the first time all over again every time I watch it. I\u2019m watching it now as we speak. This movie truly is a masterpiece.",
