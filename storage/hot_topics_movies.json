        "content": "What's up with these AI Ghibli pics recently? Wherever I go, I just cannot escape it. Being a guy who loves the cinematic art in any form, seeing this trend getting this scale of traction is simply sad. I have profound respect for the studio and I  was amazed by their work when I discovered movies like Castle in The Sky, Grave of the Fireflies, Spirited away, etc. And when I got to know how these movies are made and how much manual effort it takes to produce them, my appreciation only increased. But here comes some AI tool that can replicate this in a matter of minutes. This is no less than a slap on the faces of artists who spend hours imagining and creating something like this. \n\nI am not against AI, or advancements it is making. But there must be a limit to this. You can cut a fruit as well as stab someone with a kitchen knife. Right now, it is the latter happening with the use of AI tools just for cheap social media points. Sad state of affairs.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you guys like his trend? ",

        "content": "The first scene of pro Baseketball, we see Coop blow the Denslow Cup. He gets psyched out so bad that he falls forward, and barely makes it in the direction of the rim. Squeak made his shot right before to bring Coop to the plate with a chance to walk off Denslow Cup 4. \n\nSqueak gets roasted nonstop the entire movie. He cannot be psyched out. He gets more fucked up shit said to him than anyone by far. He lives and plays with the best psych-out artists in the league. On the surface he seems like a nervous wreck, but he's the most clutch shooter on the team. He also psychs out Tuttle to beat the LA Riots to clinch a playoff spot.\n\nSqueak always protects Joey's heroic image of Coop, even though Coop is a complete asshole to him. It's all about the kid. He tells Joey that Coop is a major dude, while not pursuing the girl at the bar. Coop falls asleep at the plate, throws the 3rd homerun over the garage, and almost kills Joey at the hospital. Before that, Coop and Remer spend Joey's whole day with the team fighting over Jenna. \n\nSqueak is a leader. With Denslow Cup 5 slipping away and the team getting blown out, It is Squeak who rallies the team on the Mulakalaka balance board of trust, while dressed as a pineapple. Remer doesn't even try, while Coop merely sucks until then. Once again, Squeak never misses. In fact, the only shot Squeak misses the entire movie is when he's not even playing, and doesn't know the rules yet.\n\nSqueak puts himself in scoring position in the Denslow Cup 5 game so many times, he collapses from running the bases. He then scores the tying run on the game winning shot. Only then, with the championship won, does Squeak engage with the girl from the bar.\n\nCoop is overwhelmed and out of his element as the player/owner. He gets distracted with the ownership of the team on the line by chasing Jenna instead of maintaining the Beers franchise and trying to make the playoffs. He flies to Calcutta to deal with his clothing line scandal and barely makes it back in time for the big game.\n\nRemer is the team cancer. When he doesn't get his way, he pouts. He cares way more about money and status than winning. He actively colludes with the Dallas owner to begin turning the league into everything it was meant not to be. He basically gives up on the team on anal-probe night, dragging the rest of the team down. Only Squeak isn't pissed off about not controlling the team they aren't the owner of.\n\nSqueak \"Little Bitch\" Scholari. MVP of the Milwaukee Beers, and Denslow Cup champion.",

        "content": "This movie came out over 10 years ago; I don't think I have to litigate its quality to anyone here. \n\nI originally saw this movie in 2014, a couple years after it released. I figured, it's no match for Shaun of the Dead, which I grew up watching from when I was 10, and not as clever as Hot Fuzz. It was just a lukewarm movie that I got a handful of laughs out of. \n\nIt wasn't until I entered adulthood that I realized how much this movie spoke to who I am as a person. It laid bare my inadequacies far clearer than any media I have ever viewed.\n\nI think the vast majority of viewers see Gary King as a pitiful character. Some may have even known someone like him. \n\nOne thing that has always struck me about this movie in later years is that it felt like it was talking directly to me in its plot points and characters.\n\nGary King is not just a fictional character. He's me. I've never felt more affinity for a fictional character than hearing Gary's monologue towards the end of the film. \n\n\"That was supposed to be the beginning of my life. All that promise and fucking optimism. It was a big lie. Nothing happened.\"\n\nFuck, man. I watched this shit for the first time when I was a sophomore in high school, out of obligation for Shaun and Fuzz at the time. I had no idea it would go on to describe an essential part of who I was for 10 years. \n\nI like to think that most people empathize with Gary here, but some of us really are that fucking pathetic to hold on to our \"glory days\" all these years later. For some of us, it really was all we ever had.\n\nIt never got better than that night.",

It was worse then any horror film I ever watched, precisely because it had no ghosts or monsters or demons. It was purely the realty of the world we live in, portrayed in a haunting,  grotesque manner.\n\n It just keeps popping up in my thoughts. What the father went through, how the mother and child died, that highway scene... everything was so uncomfortable to watch. I keep imaging how it will feel to loose the people I love the most in such a cruel way. I keep imagining how the father felt, as he watched his family taken, how the mother and daughter felt, knowing they are going to die... \n\nAnd the scene were they find their bodies, just slumped together, naked and raped on some moth-eaten couch in a junk yard. Their lifeless eyes... it was horrible. \n\nI recognize the film is a masterpiece, but I so wish I never watched it.\n\n",

        "title": "12 angry men",
        "content": "This movie wasn\u2019t supposed to surprise me. The ending was spoiled for me long before I even hit play nd to make it worse i had already seen a few key shots on YouTube so going in I thought, 'What is left to enjoy?' Turns out , everything lol\nEven knowing the outcome, this movie hooked me in ways I didn\u2019t expect. It is not about what happens it is about how it happens. Watching these 12 strangers argue ,clash nd unravel felt like seeing raw human nature laid bare. Their biases , egos nd frustrations it ia all so uncomfortably real nd that is where the brilliance lies !!\nThe cinematography blew me away. At first, the camera looks down on the jurors like we are judging them from a distance but as the movie progresses the angles shift. The room feels tighter ,the shots get closer nd by the end, we are looking up at these men. It is subtle but genius without saying a word , Sidney Lumet forces us to respect them , to understand that justice requires effort, humility nd courage.\nSpeaking of Lumet how is this his debut feature film? The man came in swinging. His ability to pull such distinct layeered performances from his cast is ridiculous. Every juror feels so real like you kinda have met them before lol tthe stubborn one , the quiet one , the loud one who doesn\u2019t shut up etc ..nd yet, together, they form this chaotic but gripping puzzle. Lumet doesn\u2019t overdo anything like he keeps it simple , letting the dialogue nd performances do all the heavy lifting lol . As much as I loved the movie , it doesn\u2019t quite fit the intensity I usually crave in films. Don\u2019t get me wrong this is smart, layered nd almost flawless but it is more cerebral than emotional ,I honestly didn\u2019t feel gutted by it the way I do with darker nd more tragic stories. It challenged me sure but it didn\u2019t hit as hard as I expected\nAnyway even spoiled, 12 Angry Men is a masterclass in filmmaking nd that is how you know it is a damn good film",

        "content": "Finally got around to watching this. Ben Johnson, Cameron Milzer and Tim Thomerson were the best actors on screen by far.  Melanie Griffith was very wooden and there is an early bit-part for Lawrence Fishburn which you will miss if you're not paying attention. Lot's of money put into sets for sure.  The story had potential and direction by Steve De Jarnatt is adequate but I was expecting something more.  I guess the plot was simply too predictable. Surprised Melanie Griffith was cast in \"Working Girl\" along Harrison Ford so soon after this performance. Thoughts from the gallery?",
