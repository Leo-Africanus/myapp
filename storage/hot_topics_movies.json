        "content": "**Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread**\n\n* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/captain_america_brave_new_world): 52% (114 Reviews)\n* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/captain-america-brave-new-world/): 43 (37 Reviews)\n\nReviews:\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/02/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-marvel-reboot-1236286418/):\n\n&gt;Director Julius Onah (*Luce)* and a boatload of writers provide plenty of oppotunity for Mackie to show his strengths although Evans\u2019 Steve Rogers is a tough act to follow. That fact is even alluded to at one point, but watching Mackie taking Sam Wilson into the big leagues is a game effort with room to grow.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-1236303617/) (70):\n\n&gt;Wilson\u2019s Captain America lacks the serum-enhanced invincibility that defined Rogers. He\u2019s a hand-to-hand combat badass, but far more dependent on his shield and wingsuit, both of which are made of vibranium. You could say that that makes him a hero more comparable to, say, Iron Man (though Tony Stark\u2019s principal weapon was Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s motormouth), and Wilson\u2019s all-too-mortal quality comes through in the sly doggedness of Mackie\u2019s when-you\u2019re-number-two-you-try-harder performance. But on a gut level we\u2019re thinking, \u201cWasn\u2019t the earlier Captain America more\u2026super?\u201d\n\n[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-marvel-1236133439/) (40):\n\n&gt;At 118 minutes, *Captain America: Brave New World* thankfully runs on the short side for a Marvel movie, but under the uninspired direction of Julius Onah (*Luce*, *The Cloverfield Paradox*) it feels much longer. Even the CGI special effects prove underwhelming, and sometimes worse than that. It is a kick, though, to recognize Ford\u2019s facial features in the Red Hulk, even if the character is only slightly more visually convincing than his de-aged Indiana Jones in that franchise\u2019s final installment.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/captain-america-brave-new-world-review/) (30):\n\n&gt;\u201cCaptain America: Brave New World\u201d was directed by Julius Onah (\u201cLuce\u201d), but like lots of Marvel movies lately, it plays like it was made by a focus group. Everything looks clean, so clean it looks completely fake, and every time a daring choice could be made, the movie backs away from the daring implications. This is a film where the President of the United States literally turns red and tries to publicly murder a Black man, and yet according to \u201cBrave New World,\u201d the real problem is that we weren\u2019t sympathetic enough to the dangerously corrupt rage monster. This film\u2019s steadfast refusal to engage with its own ideas, either by artistic design or corporate mandate, reeks of timidity.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/captain-america-brave-new-world-movie-review-1235094677/) (C-):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s fitting enough that \u201cBrave New World\u201d is a film about (and malformed by) the pressures of restoring a diminished brand. It\u2019s even more fitting that it\u2019s also a film about the futility of trying to embody an ideal that the world has outgrown. Sam Wilson might find a way to step out of Steve Rogers\u2019 shadow, but there\u2019s still no indication that the MCU ever will.\n\n[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-red-hulk) (5/10):\n\n&gt;Captain America: Brave New World feels neither brave, nor all that new, falling short of strong performances from Anthony Mackie, Harrison Ford, and Carl Lumbly.\n\n[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/marvel-movies/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-mcu-marvel/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;Anthony Mackie's Captain America earns his Stars and Stripes in this uneven, un-MCU thriller. Sam Wilson and an always-excellent Harrison Ford drag Brave New World into unfamiliar narrative territory before it eventually succumbs to familiar Marvel failings\n\n[Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-mcu-anthony-mackie-1235251815/) (40):\n\n&gt;While *Brave New World* is nowhere near as bad as the various MCU low points of the past few years, this attempt at both reestablishing the iconic character and resetting the board is still weak tea. The end credits\u2019 teaser \u2014 you knew there would be one \u2014 feels purposefully generic and vague, as if the powers that be became gun-shy in regards to committing to a storyline that might [once again be forced to pivot](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/jonathan-majors-kang-marvel-fired-mcu-future-domestic-violence-loki-avengers-1234931990/). Something\u2019s coming, we\u2019re told. Please let it be a renewal of faith in this endlessly serialized experiment.\n\n[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world/) (3/5):\n\n&gt;Pacy and punchy, this is a promising first official outing for the new Captain America, even if some awkward and inconsistent moments hold it back from greatness.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/captain-america-brave-new-world-review/) (4/10):\n\n&gt;In trying to do so much all at once, *Captain America: Brave New World* forgets what made its title character a relatable fan-favorite. Instead, we get a narrative that is as convoluted as it is boring, visuals that are as unappealing as they are uninspired, and a Marvel movie that is as frustrating as it is forgettable. Had this been a random C-list Marvel hero, that would be forgivable, but for a character as revered as Captain America, it's a huge disappointment.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/12/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-harrison-ford-juggles-green-screens-red-fists-and-vanilla-plotting) (2/5):\n\n&gt;Brave it might be, but there\u2019s nothing all that \u201cnew\u201d about the world revealed in this latest tired and uninspired dollop of content from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\n\\-------------------\n\nDirected by Julius Onah:\n\n&gt;Following the election of Thaddeus Ross as the president of the United States, Sam Wilson finds himself at the center of an international incident and must work to stop the true masterminds behind it.\n\nCast:\n\n* Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Captain America\n* Danny Ramirez as Joaquin Torres / Falcon\n* Shira Haas as Ruth Bat-Seraph\n* Carl Lumbly as Isaiah Bradley\n* Xosha Roquemore as Leila Taylor\n* J\u00f3hannes Haukur J\u00f3hannesson as Copperhead\n* Giancarlo Esposito as Seth Voelker / Sidewinder\n* Tim Blake Nelson as Samuel Sterns / Leader\n* Harrison Ford as Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross / Red Hulk",

Arguably the best character (and in general) writing I\u2019ve seen from a horror movie, they did everything right that they could, they were a group of scientists and they all acted like it. All came up with perfect plans to survive and figure out the monster. The movie didn\u2019t have to rely on dumb characters to move the plot forward, they instead gave us incredibly smart characters that ended up having no choice but to fail in the end. Plus that ending, so masterfully done, cliffhangers suck until it\u2019s something like that. Keeps you thinking about the movie long, long after you\u2019re done watching it. Absolute 10/10 in my book.",

It was basically envisioned as this: one Hobbit film, then two Lord of the Rings films under Miramax but UA actually owned the film rights to The Hobbit so they basically just decided to do two Lord of the Rings films and do The Hobbit down the road as a prequel.\n\nWell, Peter Jackson tried to talk Miramax into doing three films but there were intent on only doing two Lord of the Rings films, the first film covering Fellowship of the Ring and Two Towers and the second film covering Return of the King. And Jackson agreed to it for a while. Then somehow during pre-production, Disney CEO Michael Eisner looked at the budget which was $75M a piece for these two films. So basically, after that: Miramax wanted to tell the whole story all in one film. Here's what changes that Jackson made for Miramax's version.\n\n&gt;Between the synopsis and the treatment, Jackson decided to cut Gildor, Crickhollow, the Old Forest, Tom Bombadil, the Barrow-wight, Bill Ferney, Radagast, Lothlorien and Ghan-Buri-Ghan. The final treatment divides the story into two parts: The Fellowship of the Ring (which covered the novel of that name, and The Two Towers) and The War of the Ring. The first opens immediately with the Battle of the Last Alliance (in what Jackson called a \"James Bond\" opening) and ends with Saruman's death, and Gandalf and Pippin (the latter having looked into the Palantir) going to Minas Tirith\n\n&gt;In this treatment, Farmer Maggot and Glorfindel are present; Gwaihir and Gandalf visit Edoras after escaping Saruman, and Eowyn and Eomer help him find Shadowfax against the wishes of a possessed Theoden. Gollum attacks Frodo when the Fellowship is still united, a struggle during which the Ring falls into the mud and is picked up by Boromir. Bilbo attends the Council of Elrond and Sam looks into Galadriel's mirror. At the end of the film, Saruman is shot by an overhead Nazg\u00fbl and, before his death, is redeemed through issuing the Palantir for Gandalf to look into. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are sent south to espy Sauron's forces, and Frodo and Sam are en route to the Black Gate.\n\n&gt;The second film opens in the thick of battle, and ends with Frodo sailing to the West. It features a more pronounced romantic triangle with Arwen and Eowyn, including a scene of Aragorn and Eowyn \"asleep in each other's arms\"; and has Elladan, Elrohir and Erkenbrand join Aragorn on the Paths of the Dead (the latter dying in the process), which are described as though made of flesh. The Nazgul just make it into Mount Doom before they fall.\n\n&gt;In this version, Farmer Maggot and Fatty Bolger appear. Gandalf is more frail and has given up pipe-smoking, and Gimli's dialogue contains several vulgarities. Sam, Merry and Pippin are all caught eavesdropping behind the door and forced to go along with Frodo. The Nazgul skewer Barliman Butterbur and Wargs attack the Hobbits near Weathertop. Gandalf's account of his time at Orthanc was pulled out of flashback and Lothl\u00f3rien was cut, with Galadriel doing what she does in the story at Rivendell. Denethor attends the Council of Elrond with his son. The Watcher in the Water, absent from the treatment, is reinstated. Arwen now rescues Frodo instead of Glorfindel, and later joins the battle of Helm's Deep, where a Nazgul sweeps in, only for its fell beast slain by Gimli. Indeed, Theoden's palace is placed in Helm's Deep itself. While on the Seat of Seeing, Frodo sees the Nazgul, having killed Saruman, attack Gandalf. He puts on the Ring to draw him away and is attacked by a fell-beast, which Sam lassos to the structure. The Nazgul attacks Sam before Frodo kills it.\n\n&gt;The second script included a sex scene between Aragorn and Arwen in the Glittering Pools, interrupted by Legolas and Gimli's sight-seeing the caves. Arwen later fends off a Nazgul that menaces Pippin and joins the Rohirrim. The writers considered having Arwen absorb \u00c9owyn's role entirely by having her kill the Witch-king, with the resulting wound becoming the source of her illness. Faramir finds Frodo after Denethor sends him to do so, having learned the secret of the quest from Pippin. Imrahil and Forlong appear in the script, and Aragorn fights Sauron in front of the Black Gates\n\n&gt;Bob Weinstein commissioned Jack Lechner to sketch a one-film version of the story. Lechner saw the story as too \"dense\" and that any two-film version would have left audiences unfulfilled since the story was only \"half-told\". He thought Frodo was a weak character. On 17 June 1998, he sent a memo in which he suggested cutting Bree and the Battle of Helm's Deep, \"losing or using\" Saruman, merging Rohan and Gondor, and making \u00c9owyn Boromir's sister, shortening Rivendell and Moria (losing the Balrog and the fight in Balin's Tomb in the process) as well as having Ents prevent the Uruk-hai from kidnapping Merry and Pippin.\n\nEven Peter Jackson admitted that cutting out half of the good stuff was not a good idea at all despite Miramax trying to force him to do at first, one four-hour film, then one two-hour film. In fact, Harvey Weinstein told Peter Jackson that Weinstein wanted Quentin Tarantino to direct it but the idea was shut down. Eventually, Miramax let Peter Jackson shop around the film but limiting the turnaround window to four weeks so that they could force Peter Jackson to do the one-film version. Before the four-week period was over, Jackson found a buyer with New Line to distribute, finance and produce these movies and not only that, Bob Shaye convinced Peter Jackson to do three Lord of the Rings movies, not two of them and the rest is history.\n\n",

        "content": "\u201cWhat\u2019s the most you ever lost on a coin toss?\u201d\n\nWhat a movie. An allegorical piece of art that doesn't follow the conventional storytelling of a thriller/action. It takes us on a classic cat-and-mouse journey throughout the first 2 acts of the film. Those 2 acts providing you with a constant feeling of suspense and dread. No movie I've seen has been able to keep me on my toes as much as this one.\n\nThe tone gets set right off the bat with a brutal first kill, followed by a very clean, calm kill. This shows us Javier's character as a brutal and dangerous villain, yet being portrayed as a calm, airy person. That drastic contrast between the chaotic and cruel plot to go with the calm, tranquil atmosphere is such a unique yet effective mix and keeps you glued to the screen, wanting more.\n\nThis clever contrast of two completely different feelings is portrayed many times throughout the film. We get a more chaotic, tense \"good guy\" to follow, in Llewelyn, mixed with the calm, serene \"bad guy\" in Chigurh. We get a chaotic, rollercoaster for the first two acts, followed by a major step back into a more deep, pacific third act. This is where that allegoric film takes over the action/thriller that we grew to love in the first two acts. The momentous shift in tone is truly evident, playing with our emotions. It first starts with giving Llewelyn, the guy we grew to love and root for through the first two acts, an off-screen death, being killed by someone that isn't even the villain that we grew to hate in Chigurh, instead by some other, random hitman. This is the birth of a completely new film. The film starts brutal with Chigurh and his first two kills, only to slowly show less and less violence as the movie goes on, and in the end, practically none at all. This goes against everything we've grown to love about thriller/action/cat-and-mouse films, instead of leading up to the brilliant climax in the end, it gives us that murderous climax at the start and works backward.\n\nThis is a problem for many people, and it honestly left a sour taste in my mouth once I finished this film. However, once you realize this film is about Sheriff Bell you learn to truly appreciate this film. The entire idea of the film is that the world and society are changing, and someone like Bell doesn't quite understand it. We spend those first 2 acts in an exciting light, thinking we're along for the ride, thinking that we truly understand everything. Only for all of that understanding to be thrown away in the third act, realizing we truly don't understand it, leaving us questioning the film, and theme, as a whole. Truly putting us in the mind of Sheriff Bell, and then leaving us with that final monologue of Bell coming to terms with the fact that he can't keep up with the rapidly changing society, and rather than continuing to try and understand society, he shifts to trying to understand himself and come to peace with his flaws.\n\nIt is a very weird, and unexpected ending to a beautiful film, and will leave many people unsatisfied in the end, I am all for it however. It truly is a masterfully written film with an awkward tonal shift to an even deeper meaning and theme, yet it stays a perfect film through the whole 3 acts.\n\n*A few people seemed annoyed on my last post about The Thing (1982), because apparently it gets posted here all the time. So apologies if No Country For Old Men gets posted here a lot as well, I just enjoy writing reviews and giving my thoughts on films as well as having discussions and seeing others thoughts, especially for a movie like this*",
