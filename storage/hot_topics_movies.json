Younger viewers should eat it all up, and those weaned on the original film will appreciate the numerous shout-outs.\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/05/lilo-stitch-review-live-action-remake-1236390982/):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s a sweet film, succeeding where other remakes have failed, namely in adhering closely to the core message of what inspired it without falling too deep down the rabbit hole of computer-generated slop.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/lilo-and-stitch-review-1236404657/):\n\n&gt;Somehow, \u201cLilo &amp; Stitch\u201d has lost its unpredictable sense of anarchy in the retelling. For all intents and purposes, it could be a Hawaii-set sitcom.\n\n[The Consequence] (https://consequence.net/2025/05/lilo-and-stitch-review-disney-live-action/) (B+)\n\n&gt;While it may never fully replace the original in the hearts of its fans, this new Lilo &amp; Stitch manages to capture the real emotion embedded in this story, while also nailing all the fun that comes from an agent of chaos discovering he has a heart.\n\n[The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/lilo-stitch-is-finally-a-disney-remake-that-isnt-a-total-travesty/) (See This):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s jovial, zany, and sweet, and it recreates its adorable title alien via CGI (and a Sanders voice performance) with pitch-perfect accuracy.\n\n[Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/lilo-and-stitch-live-action-adaptation-whimsical-heartfelt-upgrade-11738389) (B+):\n\n&gt;Now 3-D rather than mere pen and ink, [Stitch] looks instantly huggable, so much so that I can\u2019t even begrudge Disney the thousands of stuffed Stitch toys this is bound to sell.\n\n[IGN] (https://www.ign.com/articles/lilo-stitch-remake-review) (8/10):\n\n&gt;Lilo &amp; Stitch is one of the stronger results of Disney\u2019s non-stop remake campaign, taking the emotional core of the original and amplifying it in a stirring manner.\n\n[The Wrap] (https://www.thewrap.com/lilo-and-stitch-2025-review/):\n\n&gt;I guess when you take something that works and make it work slightly less, it still kinda works.\n\n[Slant Magazine](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/lilo-and-stitch-review-2025/) (3/4):\n\n&gt;Here, \u201cohana\u201d doesn\u2019t just mean family but community, and the film does moving and spirited work in showcasing how crucial it is for us to lift each other up.\n\n[The Telegraph] (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/lilo-stitch-review-disney-hawaii/) (3/5)\n\n&gt;No prospective customers are going to feel alienated by anything here, from the aliens down. That makes it feel more like a product than its predecessor did, but at least it\u2019s a sturdily built one.\n\n[Screen Rant](https://screenrant.com/lilo-and-stitch-movie-review-2025/) (7/10):\n\n&gt;Audiences want to be moved and given a reason to revisit the emotions sparked by the story, and Lilo &amp; Stitch delivers.\n\n[Slashfilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1864754/lilo-and-stitch-movie-review/) (6.5/10):\n\n&gt;Fortunately, this new \"Lilo &amp; Stitch\" isn't trying to compete with its source material, and boldly refocuses the emotional heartstrings in a new direction.\n\n[USA Today] (https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2025/05/20/lilo-and-stitch-2025-movie-review/83698024007/) (2.5/4):\n\n&gt;This \u201cLilo &amp; Stitch\u201d is \u201cbroken but still good.\u201d Even if it's ultimately an unnecessary new take on a chaotic masterpiece.\n\n[IndieWire] (https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/lilo-and-stitch-review-live-action-remake-1235124603/) (C+):\n\n&gt;The heart of this story remains firmly intact, but there\u2019s something about seeing it rendered in live-action that takes away its inherent magic.\n\n[Collider](https://collider.com/lilo-and-stitch-review-live-action/) (4/10):\n\n&gt;Chris Sanders and Maia Kealoha have enough charm to keep families entertained, but it's also hard to deny that these two characters are just as, if not more, endearing in a film you can watch right now on Disney+\n\n[AV Club](https://www.avclub.com/lilo-and-stitch-review) (D):\n\n&gt;The Disney Channel Original aesthetic and a handful of wrongheaded decisions make this film just the latest in a string of soulless, cut-rate copies.\n\n[Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/lilo-and-stitch-review-remake-live-action-disney-b2754278.html) (1/5):\n\n&gt;These half-hearted substitutions prove entirely pointless in practice, shot and cobbled together as they are with the hasty quality of a reality TV show.\n\n[Associated Press] (https://apnews.com/article/lilo-stitch-2025-movie-review-f12f0cf0e8d1d3ceb24f6602de57cc1c) (1/5)\n\n&gt;Disney should have left the original alone.\n\n[The Guardian] (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/may/20/lilo-stitch-review-disney) (1/5):\n\n&gt;All told, there\u2019s hardly a single smile in Lilo &amp; Stitch \u201925 not generated through the stolen valor of the earlier screenplay, and hardly a poignant moment that\u2019s not more admirably raw in the G-rated version.\n\n\n**Synopsis**:\n\n&gt;A live-action reimagining of Disney\u2019s 2002 animated classic, \u201cLilo &amp; Stitch\u201d is the wildly funny and touching story of a lonely Hawaiian girl and the fugitive alien who helps to mend her broken family.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Maia Kealoha as Lilo Pelekai\n* Chris Sanders as the voice of Stitch\n* Sydney Elizebeth Agudong as Nani Pelekai\n* Zach Galifianakis as Dr. Jumba Jookiba\n* Billy Magnussen as Agent Pleakley\n* Courtney B.

What movies did you have to watch twice in order to fully understand them? \n\nMines likely not as confusing as most peoples choices but I feel like Donnie Darko is a movie you should definitely watch twice. I sort of got it on the first watch but the second cleared up any confusion surrounding the alternate realities etc.",

When I was six my family went to the ocean (I\u2019m from Nebraska) and I wouldn\u2019t go in it unless I was on my sister\u2019s shoulders. Apparently I was okay with her getting eaten by a shark as long as I had time to swim to shore. The second is Heavy Metal. As a little kid only familiar with Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck it was quite a shock to see such violence, nudity, and adult themes in animation. It left me with a weird sticky feeling inside. Those are my two. What are yours?",

All I could think of was Mickey Mouse is a wizard, he looks so cool, this must be a fun adventure movie. So I instantly decided I needed to buy it but I didn't have the money for it so I saved my allowances. \n\nBy the time I had enough money, I bought the tape and hurried home, super happy. Then I put it on the player and when it started with the orchestra and all, I was like, uh???!! THen it got weirder and less fun. The classical music, the scary mountain, the forest, the hippo. Even when Mickey showed up, it wasn't what I expected so I was like Homer and Bart when they realized Paint Your Wagon wasn't a bloody Western. I was pissed!!!",

Weird-looking and not handsome, I think it's actually one of my favorite Johnny Depp roles. His weirdness actually seems more authentic when he's a weird looking character. \n\nAnd a great ensemble cast as well, with stars like Ned Beatty, Bill Nighy etc, but also some truly fantastic \"voice actor\" performances.\n\nThis was so much better than I expected, from top to bottom, highly recommend.",
