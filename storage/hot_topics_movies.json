But my mental well-being has also changed dramatically.\n\nScrolling videos made my brain feel like porridge. I'd suddenly realize after 5 seconds that I was watching an obnoxious ad. No focus at all. Totally spaced out.\n\nWatching a movie actually makes me feel good. Being engaged in a storyline, maybe watching a feelgood movie like I did yesterday (The Intern) \u2026 It makes me happy and relaxed. It makes me enjoy life *more* afterwards.\n\nReading and working out is great as well, but it never made me not want to scroll. Watching a movie fulfills my desire for easy entertainment, without making it impossible to do something productive after.\n\nTomorrow marks a month of watching a movie every single day. Well, sometimes I watch half one day and the other half the next. I still think it counts.",

That last point currently has customers up in arms.\n\nCurrently, any Alamo Drafthouse social media post\u2014no matter the subject\u2014is accompanied by an onslaught of comments about the theater's plan to kill its classic paper-and-pen ordering model and replace it with a QR code-based platform, effectively ending its longstanding \u201cno phones\u201d policy. The shift is seen as a betrayal of Alamo Drafthouse\u2019s promise of a viewing experience with limited distractions. People have called it a bellwether of staffing reductions. And what better way to justify the development cost of a new ordering platform than by cutting expenses?\n\nAlamo Drafthouse\u2019s current predicament notwithstanding, there is no reason a theater cannot implement mobile ordering technology without sacrificing its soul. In fact, another Texas-based chain has done exactly that over the past several years. ",

        "title": "Joe Pesci",
        "content": "I just want to discuss Pesci's career. Pretty straightforward. I have a mild obsession because he was ubiquitous for about 8 years between the release of Goodfellas and Lethal Weapon 4, then he took that 12 year break before Love Ranch, then another 9 year break until he did the Irishman, then he got pulled out of retirement for random projects like Bupkis and Day of the Fight, etc. \n\nHe sold this house of his in, I think, New Jersey, a year or two ago and it was on public real estate web sites. I was fascinated by how early 90's it was. Everything in it was the height of luxury and state of the art entertainment from the early 90's, plus all his posters, etc. but it looked like he basically hadn't updated any of it from about 1994 on.\n\nI sometimes wonder about a career like his, where he made his mark and then went away- what could have been, or maybe this was perfect and he decided he wasn't gonna get the kind of roles to maintain his legacy so he walked away basically on top? \n\nOther actors who have done this have done it a bit more pretentiously, like Daniel Day-Lewis. \n\nAlso for all of Pesci's signature style as an actor, he truly has/had range that he rarely tapped into.\n\nI also realize he made a TON of money in his heyday. He was getting paid like $3M+ per film in the early 90's, the modern equivalent of $7M per film today, which, if your lifestyle is simple enough, would certainly be enough to retire from day to day work. He'd made around  $35M in early 90's money in about a 9 year span, which is like earning $80M-ish today.\n\nAlso did not realize he joined the Lethal Weapon franchise \\*before\\* Goodfellas! \n\nAnyway.... what are your thoughts on his career?",

        "content": "Most people watching the movie will not know this, but those motels, especially the one depicted in the movie, is literally a 5 minute drive to Disney property. The heartbreaking thing about the movie is that Moonee clearly in real life gets picked up by DCF and taken away from her mother, but her fantasy is simply to go to Disney with her best friend and live life as a child. Her dream is merely a 5 minute drive away, but her reality is being stuck poverty and now going in and out of foster care. Such a bleak and visceral movie, especially when you know there's kids that are living like this all along side 192 in central FL. ",

Preferably with a Director like Mike Flanagan.\n\nI love Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. I think it's one of the Best Horror movies ever made.\n\nBut Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is not Stephen King's The Shining. It omits important thematic elements and goes for a completely different vibe.\n\nAnd It's a Book that I think definitely deserves a more well Made more Book Accurate Adaptation that I think people will love.\nAnd Mike Flanagan has already proven he can do King like no one else.\n\nAnd before people point out the more Book accurate TV Miniseries of The Shining from King in the 90s.\nYes. It's bad. But it's not bad because it's more Book Accurate.\nIt's bad because it's a Poorly made, poorly written Miniseries on a Network TV budget in the 90s.\n.",
