To me, though, it's just strange to find movies where the filmmakers spent so much time detailing all the aspects of a new reality only to never realize how dull the end product would be. With all the pre-viz cinematics, table reads, and rough edits only to lose sight of the sum of all the parts. Obviously no one knows everything and it's great to take these risks, it's still fascinating.\n\nFor example, [City of Ember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeHf7UhHpmE).\n\n[Mortal Engines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRsFc2gguEg).\n\n[Tomorrowland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWZ7O-RrATY).\n\n[Renaissance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ftZhphGgwo) (bit of a cheat since it's animated but the new whiz bang tech for it demanded a solid story idea)",

        "content": "From [Fangoria.com](http://Fangoria.com) in an interview with Bill Skarsgard, when asked about the specific inspirations for the character of Count Orlok in Nosferatu (2024):\n\n&gt;\"There were a lot of different things. There was a Bulgarian movie called\u00a0*Time of Violence*\u2014a great movie, over four hours long, set in Bulgaria in the 17th century. And there\u2019s this guy, the antagonist of the\u00a0movie, taking over a village and forcibly converting Christians, and it\u2019s incredibly violent and horrible. That performance was something Robert talked a lot about in terms of who Orlok could have been when he was alive. We\u00a0talked about\u00a0that one a\u00a0lot,\u00a0and\u00a0various different\u00a0things\u2014little snippets from here and there.\n\n&gt;But that was during the very early stages.\u00a0Once you start delving deeper into a character, hopefully, you start getting inspiration from whatever\u00a0it is\u00a0you\u2019re\u00a0actually\u00a0working on,\u00a0and that\u00a0creates seeds that come out of it.\u00a0**Robert also wrote a backstory for Orlok, just a few pages, that he shared with me, which was also very helpful.**\"\n\nI know that in the original movie and the book, Orlok wasn't fleshed out since he served as simply being a figure of pure darkness and evil. He didn't need the background or some kind of crazy backstory, he just needed to fulfill the role in the story (alongside backstories not being as much of a focus for the time). But to hear that Robert apparently did some amount of expansion on Orlok's character got me super intrigued, and makes me wonder if anyone actually knows what this backstory is that Robert wrote?\n\nI expect this to go nowhere since the movie is relatively quite new, but I figured I'd ask the wider movie community to see if I can be surprised.",

        "content": "Synopsis: Greedy executive Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman) hopes to take control of the company he works for by purchasing a majority share -- but he must first devalue the stock. So he convinces the board to appoint know-nothing recent graduate Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins). But Mussburger's plot backfires when Barnes' latest invention succeeds, thereby increasing the company's value. Worse yet, undercover reporter Amy Archer (Jennifer Jason Leigh) has the scoop on Mussburger's shady dealings.\n\nHonestly, the synopsis doesn't do it justice.  Especially with Tim Robbins' huge role in Silo, coming back to watch his earnest performance as Norville Barnes is a breath of fresh air.  You'll find deliciously satirical writing and direction from the Coen Brothers, knock out performances by Newman and Leigh - the Hudsucker Proxy is an overlooked gem.  With the focus around New Year's Eve, there is no better time to watch this amazing movie if you've never seen it before.  Infinitely quotable, excellently acted, and supremely unique, I hope more people take the time to watch one of my favorite movies tonight.",

One my favorite disaster movies of all time with great cast and so many memorable moments- the ship turning upside down, stunt man Ernie Orsatti falling into the skylight in the dining  room, climbing the Christmas tree, climbing up the shaft, the arguments between Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters saving Hackman from drowning, Hackman yelling at God while hanging on the steam valve. I saw it when it originally came out in 1972 and must have seen it at least once a year since then. ",

        "content": "So I love and collect movies, we've got well over 1500 individual movies in our library and I know we've all gotten used to hearing the arguments that you never really \"own\" anything with digital purchases, and companies can take these movies offline at any time etc etc. and that's all true! \n\nBut another massive point i want to give physical media is also all the extras that come along with the discs. \n\nThese interactive DVD menus, the GAMES they would sometimes shove into the discs, the commentaries, making ofs, interviews, special features. If someone doesn't upload them to youtube and save them they're just gone. \n\nI'm going through Disney plus right now because there are TWO disney movies I don't own on disc and after watching the movie I went to their extras and it's just the original trailer to the movie. I'm looking online at the list of features on the DVD and I've got:\n\n* Deleted Scenes\n* behind the scenes footage\n* outtakes\n* art galleries and storyboards\n* audio and visual commentaries\n* fact or fiction deep dive into the history of the movie's lore\n* how the language of the movie was created\n* character design breakdowns\n* interviews with the cast and creatives\n\noh yeah and FOUR of the movie's trailers along with images of the print campaigns.\n\n  \nbut thanks for that ONE trailer as an Extra DisneyPlus, yeah - I love that.\n\n  \nok rant over - don't throw away your discs y'all.",

I bought tickets mainly because I was interested in the sweepstakes, and the trailer looked like something right up my alley (I love anything post apocalypse) but what a waste of 2 hours. \n\nThe setup didn't make any sense (two random dudes in a fishing boat can set off a nuke inside of random barrels? Then Russia takes out our entire electric grid?)\n\nThe only conflict was: oh our food *might* run out in months, what will we ever do? And a swat team that randomly showed up because of a corrupt government official that needs his taxes! (Who, after all brief shootout, decides to just leave?)\n\nI actually do like the message that them letting in the \"\"\"refugees\"\"\" in (basically just their neighbors outside their gate) was ultimately beneficial to them, but that's going to piss their target off so much that actually might be kinda funny. \n\nThen it wraps up with basically a trailer for a show that is streaming now and a QR code to \"pay it forward\" (buy more tickets for other people) ",

        "content": "I know a similar post was made a while back, however I am curious on the contemporary consensus and how it has changed. As a ex band kid, music and especially soundtracks are a marked and integral part of my interests. I'd like to start off by proposing Cars 2. Now it is a terrible, poorly put together film with a damn well stupid yet simultaneously overtly convoluted plot, however on recollection the only two elements I can find in it that it has going for it is firstly, how it's environments look, although given it's a Pixar film, there is little to be extracted from that, and secondly, it's soundtrack. Composed by Michael Giacchino, admittedly it's not to such a degree of quality I like, listen to all of it on the regular, however man, for such a idiotic poorly written Bond inspired spy car, the musical motif and theme is so infuriatingly catchy and euphonious, it is such a tremendous shame it is not the classy espionage track for a much better film. What's even more of a shame is that I feel like the theme for the poor man's James Bond ripoff car sounds better for Bond than his actual theme. Although I shall concede that the theme does of course take heavy inspiration from other themes, and I might be biased since I. It's melody and instrumentation it does somewhat resemble classic rock and jazz which is something I do indeed like. Still though, it is unquestionably the best part of the movie for me, and probably the only part of it I'd actually recommend for people. \n\nSuch as now... Even the other elements of the pieces are quite good. This is a soundtrack compilation for reference.\nhttps://youtu.be/vz_j_AOsH5w?si=5e3UHO5o6KNSOJPF\n\nI'm curious if other similar films fit this description, those whose best aspects are indeed their music, composed by a film composer who likely is better than the whole of the directorial staff.

The refrigerator actually scared me for some reason. I like at the end when sara, marion, and tyrone curl up into a fetal position. It quite symbolic to me. The fact that it is all very real and these things actually happen to ppl is very sad. Great portrayal of how drug addictions can ruin one\u2019s life. Honestly a great movie, but a disturbing and tragic one. 4 stars for me. ",
