Btw I\u2019m going back and forth between the character letters and the actor names to make it make sense for myself.\n\nIn MiB3, it\u2019s revealed that K had traveled back in time\\* and witnessed not only J as a small kid but the death of his father, and K knew he was basically unwittingly responsible for how J grew up. But K doesn\u2019t treat it as a burden, he\u2019s honored by it and the father\u2018s heroic sacrifice.\n\nSo in the first movie, Tommy Lee Jones\u2019 insistence that Will Smith should not only be a new MiB agent but even his replacement when he retires makes all the more sense.\n\n\\*edit: sorry for fucking that up, Tommy Lee Jones didn\u2019t travel back in time of course, but we did. And he had those memories. ",

Then finally get caught the second after they complete their goal like their protection ran out the exact moment the task was done\n\nI\u2019m curious do you think they caused so much chaos because they knew they wouldn\u2019t get caught until their goal was done or is this just how they normally live?\n\nI\u2019m not trying to religious debate here just a discussion about the film and their actions in it",

        "content": "Furiously writing down my thoughts here having just rewatched Minority Report.\n\nHaving consumed so much modern media recently, both films and TV, I often find myself getting frustrated when a writer or director just either can't get to the point OR can't explain their concept well enough without dedicating hours or multiple episodes to it.\n\nWithin the first 6 minutes of Minority Report, Spielberg explains all of the insane concepts of the his film effortlessly and in such a way that it not only makes sense but you don't even need to question the premise, it just works.\n\nWithin 6 minutes we get:\n\nPrecrime, precogs, time horizons, future cops with jet packs and why some balls are different colours than others and you just sit there and go \"yeah ok makes sense\".\n\nI feel like if this film were made today, the above concepts would be spread out over a course of a multiple episodes of a TV show or spread thin across the entire length of a film. Yet somehow Spielberg can craft this world, introduce us to all these wild ideas and all within just a few minutes, leaving us equipped to tackle the rest of the film.\n\nIn my honest opinion its brilliant film making and truly the work of a master film maker.\n\nWhat do you think?",

        "content": "First of all, I'm sorry that I haven't watched all the movies in the world before. I've watched 80s and 90s action movies as a kid. We didn't have Tv channels, only DVDs. As an adult I've watched a lot of movies but Tv in my country shows usually 2000s movies so I've missed a lot. By myself I mainly watched more unkown movies. \n\nNow to the point, all the legendary movies from the 80s and 90s are just so known that I've gotten the basic plot just from other people so I never bothered to watch them. Then I decided to watch Ghostbusters after seeing the Afterlife on tv. Gb 1 and 2 were great and I can't believe I haven't watched them before. I've seen Top Gun, but now I actually watched it, same with Jurassic park. \n\nSeeing BttF was mind blowing, and Marty was so unpredictable and not your basic guy who's just screwed in every situation. I can absolutely see why this was so big of a hit then and hopefully still is. Going to watch the other 2 now and moving on to other movies. One that I'm looking toward for is the Sixth Sense, yes I know the twist in the end so maybe that's why I've haven't watched it but I like Bruce Willis. I've seen Indiana Joneses and Star warses, Scarface and Die hards, but I could take some suggestions about the big movies from that time that I might have missed.",

Both Gary Oldman\u2019s and Denzel Washington\u2019s performances were incredible and it was such an interesting movie, no spoilers for anyone who hasn\u2019t seen it but the twist at the end got me and the fight scenes were beautifully executed. The cast was stacked too, so many great actors. 10/10, definitely in my top five.",

        "content": "For me, probably the original French Martyrs. Ive only revisited it once and it still such a daunting task. It is unflinching nihilistic take on both the elites and religious fanaticism.\n\nEspecially with the recent discoveries in the Epstein files, it makes even the opening scene of Lucie escaping so tragically impactful.\n\nAnd if you know the ending, you know how brutal of a conclusion it is to this film.",
