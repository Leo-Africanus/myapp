Guy's a complete scumbag ffs. Not to mention keeping all the world changing tech secrets to himself lol \n\nAnd i swear this guy isnt just simply \"absent minded\"... Hes such a genius yet cant tell time properly and misses the first wedding, whilst not realizing hes been lecturing a life drawing class for a full 5 minutes, nor that he was at a rehearsal dinner for his own wedding just the night before, is utterly bonkers!! \n\nI mean theres ditzy and scatterbrained, and then theres just full blown dementia! \ud83e\udd26\n\nDear god this has spoiled my memories of this flick BIG TIME! \ud83d\ude1e\n\nDid I miss anything?

Seeing Toronto be itself in a film (Not a US city) along with laughing at jokes that only Torontonians would get, is a special memory.\n\nWhat are some of those experiences for you?",

        "content": "I love characters who are portrayed as so manipulative or persuasive that merely speaking with them is considered dangerous. Characters whose words can alter your reality, break your will, or turn you against yourself.\n\nHannibal Lecter in *The Silence of the Lambs* is the quintessential example of this. The film treats his words like a contagion. Even the FBI approaches speaking with him as an extreme danger.\n\nOther examples I could think of:\n\n* Saruman in *LOTR*\\- his voice is described as having a hypnotic, corrupting power that can sway even the strongest minds\n* Amy Dunne in *Gone Girl*\\- master manipulator who can create elaborate psychological traps\n* Rust Cohle in *True Detective* (TV) - has an insane ability to trick suspects into confession\n\nWhat other characters would you add to this list?\n\nFor clarity's sake, here are some that I would argue **do not** fit this list:\n\n* Norman Bates in *Psycho-* he doesn't try to psychologically destroy you through dialogue, but the more he speaks the more just he reveals his craziness\n* Patrick Bateman in *American Psycho*\\- his conversations are more about hiding his true nature like a classic psychopath (his violence is strictly physical)\n* The Joker in *The Dark Knight-* he's more interested in proving his philosophical points through actions and violence rather than corrupting through conversation",

        "content": "Crazy night.\n\nLiving in Los Angeles and going to revival theaters you get some special folks showing up. Sometimes it is directors, writers, cast and crew. Sometimes planned, other times totally spontaneous. Like when I saw\u00a0*Tank Girl*\u00a0here and Lori Petty ran up front in pajamas with her sister, shocking the host.\n\nTonight I went to a midnight screening of\u00a0*Buckaroo Banzai*\u00a0at Quentin Tarantino's New Beverly in LA. Peter Weller showed up as a last minute guest.\n\nA few tidbits:\n\n* He and his wife sat next to me in the back row. Kind of surreal.\n* He was very nice to fans asking for autographs and selfies. Most people gave him space but he was generous.\n* He is so smart. Speaks Italian and has a PhD in art.\n* Funny too. He said his intro would be six to eight minutes. Host assured him no questions. But he talked 20-30 minutes and invited questions from the audience.\n* He said 5 questions and none about Robocop. Big laugh from the crowd.\n* He had not planned to go tonight but when he saw it was playing he told his wife let's do this. He is friends with Tarantino and had intro\u2019d a midnight before. Earlier that night he was at the Egyptian seeing Kubrick\u2019s*Barry Lyndon*\u00a0in 4K. He joked afterward they would be so buzzed after 4 hours of depressing Kubrick it would feel like being on meth. The crowd roared.\n* He spoke about the communal side of seeing films in theaters and praised Tarantino for keeping that alive in LA. This was very important to him.\n* He joked that years ago at a\u00a0*Buckaroo*\u00a0event Lithgow turned to him and said \u201cI do not know what the movie is about, do you?\u201d Kevin Smith gave a thirty minute intro explaining it and Lithgow said over and over again  \u201cI did not know that, did you?\u201d\n* He said\u00a0*Buckaroo*\u00a0defied genres and Fox never knew what to do with it. Praised it for not spoon feeding and for challenging audiences.\n* Doing the band scene was the most fun part. \n* He went golfing with actor Dennis Haysbert (edited this I autocorrect misspelled originally...  apologies to Dennis)  who told him*Buckaroo*\u00a0was his favorite movie. When asked what it was about, Halbert said \u201clove.\u201d\n* He said learning names on a set makes it like family. And you remember family. He has kept friendships for many years from his movies.\n* In discussing Shakedown from an audience member question Peter said he  loves Sam Elliott from\u00a0*Shakedown*. Elliott supported him when Weller rn the NYC marathon. He shouted his name and Peter was like there's no way he couldn't identify that voice. And Elliot threw him an orange. He said\u00a0*Shakedown*\u00a0was the last film shot in New York before the city became too nice.\n* On\u00a0*Of Unknown Origin*\u00a0he said the rat was never supposed to appear but the studio insisted. Shot in Montreal, which he enjoyed. He loved working with George Cosmatos who also directed him in\u00a0*Leviathan*.\n* Sitting next to him I told him I loved\u00a0*Leviathan*\u00a0and\u00a0*Of Unknown Origin*. He said he liked working with George Cosmatos. I mentioned Panos Cosmatos and\u00a0*Mandy*. His wife reminded me Peter was in Del Toro\u2019s\u00a0*Cabinet of Curiosities*\u00a0in the Panos-directed episode\u00a0*The Viewing*.\n* Spesking to someone else he mentioned how he loved Dennis Hopper. He worked with Hopper in Top of the World (1997). Hopper's name came up because Peter was asking what played earlier in the day and they had screened Super Mario Bros. (Which I also went to lol) He really gushed on how great a person Hopper was.\n* He spoke a lot about art. Mentioned Antonello da Messina\u2019s\u00a0*Virgin Annunciate*\u00a0and his own book\u00a0*Leon Battista Alberti in Exile: Tracing the Path to the First Modern Book on Painting*.\n* He said Ali McGraw led him into loving art.\n\nFor a midnight show, the New Beverly usually keeps intros short. But this was a special night. Peter Weller was awesome.",

        "title": "Finally got around to watching Goodfellas",
        "content": "I've made my way through the majority of Martin Scorsese's filmography and have watched all his major works - Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Wolf of Wall Street, Casino, The Departed etc. - but for some reason, had never gotten around to watching Goodfellas. This was finally rectified!\n\nOverall, I'll say that the movie very much lives up to its reputation as an all-time crime classic . It really feels like the most Scorsese movie ever - of course there's the fixation on the dark temptations of the criminal life and the bad boys that inhabit it, but also a lot of classic Scorsese stylistic touches like the voiceover narration, freeze frames, long takes and perfect musical needle drops. \n\nHenry Hill is a *relatively* more sympathetic protagonist than the likes of Jake Lamotta, Travis Bickle or Jordan Belfort, which actually works to make his inevitable descent into paranoia and losing it all feel bleaker and more impactful. Goodfellas really strips down the mystique and appeal around the whole wiseguy lifestyle and shows these people for who they really are, a bunch of egotistical, insecure and psychopathic assholes with very little humanity in them. Henry, for as shitty as he is, is really just a passenger along for the ride with these human monsters, and he never could fully become the true gangster he had always wanted to be. \n\nThe pacing of this movie is pretty incredible - for something that runs nearly 2.5 hours, it pretty much flies by. The plot is just incidental but that's not really the focus. The dialogue and the characterization are just absolutely incredible. Every character is vividly written and acted, with fantastic performances across the board by Ray Lotta (RIP), Robert de Niro, Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracco. Scorsese just has an uncanny mastery at creating these incredibly immersive criminal underworlds that are both terrifying and mesmerizing. \n\nI don't have much more to add - this movie is an all-timer for a reason.",

While Netflix is giving this visual feast just a three-week theatrical run ahead of its streaming debut, it begs to be experienced on the big screen.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/frankenstein-review-guillermo-del-toro-oscar-isaac-jacob-elordi/) (95): \n\n&gt;Del Toro\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein\u201d is a remarkable achievement that in a way hijacks the flagship story of the horror genre and turns it into a tale of forgiveness. James Whale, one suspects, would approve \u2013 and Mary Shelley, too.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/frankenstein-review-jacob-elordi-guillermo-del-toro-1235147197/) (B):\n\n&gt;Del Toro\u2019s second Netflix movie is bolted to the Earth by hands-on production design and crafty period detail. While it may be too reverently faithful to Mary Shelley\u2019s source material to end up as a GDT all-timer, Jacob Elordi gives poignant life to the most emotionally complex Frankenstein monster since Boris Karloff.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/aug/30/frankenstein-review-guillermo-del-toro-oscar-isaac-jacob-elordi) (3/5):\n\n&gt;Oscar Isaac and Jacob Elordi star as the freethinking anatomist and his creature as Mary Shelley\u2019s story is reimagined with bombast in the director\u2019s unmistakable visual style\n\n[RadioTimes](https://www.radiotimes.com/movies/frankenstein-review-2025-guillermo-del-toro/) (5/5):\n\n&gt;Perhaps its hyperbole to call the film del Toro\u2019s masterpiece \u2013 especially a story that has been told countless times. But this is a work that is the accumulation of three-and-a-half decades of filmmaking knowledge. Gory and grim it may be, but it is a tragic tale told in a captivating manner.\n\n[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/frankenstein-review/ ) (80):\n\n&gt;Cleaving closely to the source material, del Toro wants to explore the trauma that makes us, mankind's capacity for cruelty, the death we bring on ourselves through war, and the catharsis of forgiveness \u2013 all notions that make Frankenstein relevant in current world politics and social media savagery.\n\n\n\n\\-----------------------------------\n\nWritten and Directed by Guillermo del Toro:\n\n&gt;A brilliant but egotistical scientist brings a creature to life in a monstrous experiment that ultimately leads to the undoing of both the creator and his tragic creation.\n\nCast:\n\n* Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein\n   * Christian Convery as young Victor\n* Jacob Elordi as the Creature\n* Mia Goth as Elizabeth Lavenza\n* Christoph Waltz as Henrich Harlander\n* Felix Kammerer as William Frankenstein\n* Lauren Collins as Claire Frankenstein\n* Lars Mikkelsen as Captain Anderson\n* David Bradley as Blind Man\n* Sofia Galasso as Little Girl\n* Charles Dance as Leopold Frankenstein\n* Ralph Ineson as Professor Krempe\n* Burn Gorman as Fritz",
