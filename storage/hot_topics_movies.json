The camera pans to show the surroundings and all of sudden you see the poster that\u2019s still pinned to the log that his friend pinned up.\n\nI realized last night that it\u2019s the exact same trench that they charged out of half way though the movie and the same trench that they charged to get into at the end of the war. It basically went to show that during the war, neither side actually made true gains but rather fought from and fought to win, again and again. They fought over the same small piece of land repeatedly. Insane.",

        "content": "Just saw Companion and I was blown away how much I loved this little gem of a movie. The last scene as she drives away showcases the song Emotion by Samantha Sang. At first I thought what the hell is this cool song? But I realized I knew it and thought it was cheesy. But the movie just completely transformed the song into something new and lovely and I will now forever associate it with that scene. The scene made the song better. Anyone else have that experience with this or other songs?  ",

I really enjoyed those after a tough period of not being able to watch any movies\u2026",

        "content": "I\u2019m really wondering what animated film visually impresses you the most. Currently watching the Polar Express in 3D and it\u2019s impressive. There\u2019s also stuff like Zootopia and the Bad Guys 2.\n\nPerhaps you find the traditional animation of Studio Ghibli films to be superb.\n\nFrozen is a stupendous achievement of course.\n\nTMNT mutant mayhem looked sick imo. There\u2019s also stuff like A Scanner Darkly.\n\nwhat\u2019s your pick for the most visually stunning animated film of all time?\n\nIt can even be a video game honestly. It can be the current standards of animation or something like Toy Story which was groundbreaking for it\u2019s time.\n\nSome of mine off the top of my head: The Secret of Nihm, Alita Battle Angel, Batman Mask of the Phantasm, Frozen, Animal Farm (1954). Recently saw Stitchead and liked it a lot.",
