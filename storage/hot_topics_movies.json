It hates you, and is unapologetic for how much it tortures you psychologically. On HBO Max right now for anyone that hasn't seen it, but please be warned: if you cannot stomach child abuse or movies with grief in them like this, it isn't for you. 10/10 film...but I am most likely never putting myself through it again!",

He senses someone is there and crosses over the balcony to a sliding door \u2014 and there's a girl in bed waiting for him.\" \n\n\n\n\n&gt;Frankly, you don't need a star,\" Campbell adds. \"James Bond is the star and the film is the star. **They just need to find a terrific actor who looks right for the part.\"**",

The set-up is standard cops &amp; robbers fare with the good guy looking for revenge on the bad guy that murdered his partner.\n\nIn this instance though the good guy isn't good at all. Secret Service agent Richard Chance (William\u00a0 Petersen) is an amoral thrill seeker that treats everyone who crosses his path with contempt &amp; considers them disposable as the means to reach his goal.\n\nIronically his quarry Eric \"Rick\" Masters (Willem Dafoe) has more in common with him than his colleagues. Sadistic New Wave dandy Rick is an artist/forger with exacting standards. He also seems to relish the high stakes cat &amp; mouse game.\n\nDirector William Friedkin sets a\u00a0 kinetic pace early on that rarely lets up. This is aided by score by the band Wang Chung. It's percussive &amp; driving in a way that makes you feel on edge.\n\nThe big set piece the film is known for is the nearly 10 minute long chase scene. As amazing as that is the film has just so much else going for it. Nearly all the characters are hatching their own little schemes to move ahead &amp; none of them feel particularly sympathetic.\n\nI can't recommend this film enough. It's available free with ads on Tubi &amp; Pluto.\u00a0",

        "content": "SID AND NANCY, 1986 DIRECTOR ALEX COX : GARY OLDMAN &amp; CHLOE WEBB. This is another hard movie. It\u2019s a hard movie with a heart of gold.\n\nAbout the life of Sid vicious and Nancy Spungen, who he met while with the Sex Pistols and stayed with after his departure as she let him into heroin use. Has he embarked on his own solo career, Nancy was by his side as his habit grew deeper\u2026 Circumstance, he stabbed Nancy during a heroin episode killing her. The film is not a walk down candy lane at all\u2026 But what you\u2019re seeing is one of Gary Oldman\u2018s first spring performances along with Chloe Webb brilliant portrayal and Nancy and the focus Alex Cox puts on the love they have for each other not the drugs. Everybody likes to associate with the both of them. It makes for a very heartfelt film about troubled, lovers Gary Oldman it\u2019s electric, as is Chloe this clip is based on a real music video vicious shot for his own rendition of the standard my way, and I think it perfectly encapsulates the love between both Sid and Nancy.
