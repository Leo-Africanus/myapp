But the opera scene with Cher in that black dress and all-black make-up was mesmerizing, I think that sequence won her the Oscar. \n\nOlympia Dukakis was the heart and soul of the movie for me. There was more emotion, it was more grounded for me. Her character having to suffer in silence as her husband cheats on her and her dalliance with John Mahoney's character. That arc had way more substance than the muppet show delivered by Cher and Nicolas Cage cosplaying Stanley Kowalski meets Frank Zappa.",

        "content": "Been producing indies for a while and got sick of the guesswork around who's actually buying, what people are looking for, and general trends coming out of film markets. Spent months tracking acquisition patterns and eventually just decided to start building myself a tool to help resolve this pain point! Some things I've been finding from the data that's being tracked.\n\n**Budget reality that'll surprise you:**\n\n* Horror has 105 buyers in the $5-25M range (way more than expected)\n* Only 51 buyers want horror under $5M (the \"cheap horror\" myth is dead)\n* 20 companies are seeking horror at $25M+ (elevated horror is real)\n\n**Weirdly specific buyer needs happening right now:**\n\n* Netflix specifically wants \"period dramas with strong female protagonists\" and \"Australian content\"\n* Hulu is actively seeking \"coming-of-age comedies with LGBTQ+ themes\" under $5M\n* Monkeypaw Productions wants \"contained horror/thriller with societal commentary under $25M\"\n* Sony is hunting for \"contained supernatural horror with youth ensemble cast\"\n\n**The data shows something counterintuitive:**\n\n* 1,329 companies have very specific, detailed acquisition needs (not just \"seeking drama\")\n* The buyers with the most specific requirements are often the most accessible\n* Generic pitches are getting lost - precision targeting is what's working\n\n**What seems to have worked for me:**\u00a0Skip the generic pitches. The data shows buyers know exactly what they want right now. Match those exact needs and you'll cut through the noise. Obviously easier said than done! Hardest part is obviously getting that foot in the door. But I just found putting all my effort and time into specific buyers versus spray and pray has paid off more. \n\nGot so frustrated with this guesswork that I went hard down the rabbit hole of vibe coding and built myself a solution that tracks a massive amount of data then analyzes it and matches buyers with my projects. Probably overkill, but manually following thousands of companies was driving me insane. I also couldn't find other solutions to help with this.\n\nAnyone other filmmakers finding success with hyper-targeted pitches? What pathways and most successful strategies worked for you?",
