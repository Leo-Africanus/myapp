        "title": "The Marcus-Nelson Murders (1973), the 'pilot' TV movie for Kojak, is 'amazing'",
        "content": "No kidding. It's a monster of a movie. Written by legendary Hollywood writer Abby Mann, the movie is (surprisingly accurately) based on the real life 1963 Career Girls Murders case, in which two NYC roommates were murdered by a prowler.\n\nThe movie is insanely well written and the direction, by Jaws 3's Joseph Sargent, is at times brilliant. The ensemble cast is out of this world.\n\nIt's one of the best movies I've come across in a 'long' time. This should have been playing in theaters and winning Academy Awards.\n\nI've never watched an episode of Kojak in my life, but I understand that the series dropped the realism of the movie and instead went full on for silly pulp.\n\nThe movie is free and legal to watch on YouTube, in pretty terrific quality.",

What are some adaptations where the movie really stepped up or even outdid the book? Could be better pacing, stronger performances, a more emotional ending, or just a case where the story worked better on screen. Would love to hear your picks! Maybe controversial...but my pick is The Lord of the Rings.",

        "title": "Restraint in horror movies is the most overlooked opportunity for great horror.",
        "content": "Like many fans of the horror genre, I\u2019m constantly searching for that great \u201cscare\u201d. For me, it\u2019s almost never going to come from the excessive use of production elements or tropes that simply remind you that you\u2019re watching a movie. Excessive use of sound effects that telegraph what you\u2019re meant to be scared of, unrealistic sound design (stabbing a human body doesn\u2019t sound like stepping on a bag of grapes), saturating you with jump scares every five minutes, overly polished production design.\n\nEvery now and then there are movies that demonstrate restraint, with a director that realises for example, that a figure that simply emerges in the background and is seen to the audience but not the main character can chill you to the bone, and doesn\u2019t need to be telegraphed with stock sound design that we\u2019ve heard hundreds of times before. That silence can add to the terror and keep you inside the world that\u2019s been created. That tension and dread is better than the incessant release of a jump scares. Take Alien or Paranormal activity for example (there\u2019s plenty of others). These classics exercised exactly this type of restraint. Please horror directors, invest in the subtleties of your art form and  create more great horror!",
