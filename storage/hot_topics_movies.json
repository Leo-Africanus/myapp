        "content": "I\u2019ve no idea how, but during the 90s and early aughts the ole man convinced Fox/Columbia/Tristar that he was a critic.\n\nI know this, but many do not.\n\nIf you were on the correct list you would receive a kit for almost every\nmovie that came out. I have no idea if this is still a thing or if they\njust do digital now.\n\nBut some of these are intricate AF with custom print. Some seems to have\nrequired additional manufacturing.\n\nFor example the 2003 Charlies Angles : FULL Throttle PK is in the shape\nof a voice box.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/lqp1itg\n\nThere are other examples but nothing notable ATM. I remember the\nSwingers PK being memorable from my childhood but i forgot why. I know\nas a fact me and my siblings trashed a good amount of these PKs back in\nthe day. We got like 2 a week so I just assumed it was normal lol\n\nSo when I made the post I thought I would have like 1 or 2 people hit me up and I'd ship them some cool merch. \n\n\nThis blew up and I will finish the list but THERES SO MANY!!!\n\nWILL UPDATE LATER TODAY 2/15\n\nI am sorting and corresponding as fast as I can I have so many boxes to\ngo through, it seems like they are going backwards in date.\n\nEither way here\u2019s my list i will be editing it as I go through the\nboxes, I have gone through almost 2 boxes there are 4 more :D\n\nGiven the response to this I will finish cataloging the boxes, I did not\nplan to sell anything. I honestly thought I was going to throw most of\nthis away.\n\nOnce my siblings have had a chance to look over the list I will message\nanyone back who was interested in purchasing something. I am not hurting\nfor money so do not be rude, I am just having fun going through my late\nfathers old things. If you see something you might want leave me a\nmessage on reddit and if it\u2019s available I\u2019ll hit you up if they are\npurchasable.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHAT\u2019S IN THE PRESS KITS?\n\nFor the sake of this post:\n\nPK = Usually a stapled group of papers covering the shoot, actors,\nquotes, generic advertisement stuff.

        "content": "I must say I was a bit skeptic when both of my sons (15 and 17) said they would join me watching Dances with wolves today. Especially when this was the extended version, that would be almost 4 hours. They are both kids of today with all that entails. It's sometimes hard making them keep attention for a short amount of time without any brain stimuli going on or them checking their phones.\n\nDuring todays movie none of them were on the phone one time, the only time they spoke it was about something happening in the movie. We had just one break during a 4 hours movie and it was a short pee break.\n\nThey were captivated. I'm impressed, this has never happened before and we are talking about a movie from 1990 and it is a 4 hours movie, slow even at that time. If this is not peak storytelling and a Grand Slam for the movie I don't know what might be.\n\nIt surely has it flaws we could discuss up and down, but from me to you a highly recommended movie to see with teen children!",

        "content": "Basically as far as I am aware, using real company logos in movies generally is fine especially if the logo is something random in the background like when companies are shown in the background on a scene where the character is driving down the road. But in Deepwater Horizon, BP is portrayed very negatively (rightfully so) and their logo is used pretty front and center on the uniforms of some of the main actors in the show. Considering to prominently use a logo like this typically takes permission from the company, why would BP agree to this? Or did the movie just decide to deal with the legal consequences after the fact?",

For me the best scene in the movie was when Samuel Jackson talks Chris tucker into the trunk of the car, if you have seen the movie you\u2019ll know, the music is perfect setting the tone just right the song is by the Johnston Brothers ",

I had seen and was a fan of *BlackBerry* and *Operation Avalanche* from director Matt Johnson, but only knew of *Nirvanna the Band the Show* by name. I binge-watched the webseries and the 2 season Viceland show in the week leading up to seeing the movie and instantly became a NtBtStM evangelist. The funniest and most daring film I saw all of last year. In their [year-end wrap-up](https://letterboxd.com/2025/#2025-festival-faves), Letterboxd had it ranked as the highest rated \"festival fave\".\n\nNow I've been impatiently waiting 3 months to see it again with an audience and have been spamming family, friends, and colleagues to go see it this weekend. I've also been eagerly waiting to hear the reaction from wider unsuspecting audiences, so I was sad to not see an official discussion pop up yet. According to this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/nirvannatheband/comments/1r4cog4/audience_member_in_la_screening_tonight/), even J.J. Abrams was at the Friday screening in L.A.!\n\nIf you've seen it, please share your spoiler-filled thoughts! If you haven't, go see it and come back!",

        "content": "During a conversation with my brother, he came up with a list of movies that he believes should be on a bucket list. This film was on it. I can see why. Particularly for classic crime/intrigue aficionados.\n\nI went in blind.\n\nA quick synopsis without spoilers: Gene Hackman stars as the protagonist who is involved in monitoring the conversations of people.\n\nWhat I loved about this movie is that the main theme seeps into the cinematography, to the acting and into the perceptions of the viewer as the film's narrative unfolds. We become the protagonist and feel what he feels without any words being exchanged. Masterful.\n\nThe said dominant theme, according to my humble view, is paranoia. This paranoia that surrounds and becomes internalized by the protagonist. But the justification for it is actually presented quite well from both a plot and psychological perspective: Mr Caul has a chosen a line of work that involves watching and listening to others without their knowledge. His colleagues in the same line of work do the same, and he must constantly consider whether he himself might be the object rather than the subject.\n\nAdding to this is his own religious beliefs, as displayed by the scene during confession in the church.\n\nFurthermore, the film powerfully demonstrates how this paranoia slowly inhibts much of his social interactions outside of his work: he cannot connect on a personal level with other people, he has trouble relaxing. Outside of the topic of surveillance, I could even say this film says a lot of about work, and how it can take over your life, leave your life outside of it in tatters.\n\nFantastic film. Recommended to others.\n\n(the only thing I could possibly say I disliked has nothing to do with the film, and everything to do with when it was made: I can't stand that cheesy 70s Jazz and drum sound that pops up a few times, however I think it's actually part of the recording from the park, not the soundtrack)",

Now, after working away from home for years and seeing how fast time actually moves, the whole father-daughter storyline hit hard. The scenes where Cooper watches decades of missed messages, and Murph growing up without him \u2014 those moments felt way more real than the space travel itself.\n\nI also noticed details I missed before: how lonely space feels, how desperate humanity\u2019s situation is, and how every decision costs someone years of life back home. It felt less like a sci-fi movie and more like a story about time and regret.\n\nMade me realize sometimes it\u2019s not the movie that changes \u2014 it\u2019s us.\n\nAnyone else had a movie completely change for them on rewatch?
