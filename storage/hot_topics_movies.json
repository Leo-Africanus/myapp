        "content": "This movie is something special. The cast meshes extremely well. Sigourney Weaver was smoking hot in the movie and delivers some phenomenal jokes. Tim Allen is at his peak. Alan Rickman is clearly an actor above the rest and without him, this movie just isn\u2019t the same. He plays his role to perfection. Then you have Sam Rockwell. Easily one of my favorite movies for him. Finally, he\u2019s a bit of a sleeper in this movie, but Tony Shalhoub was quietly hilarious too.  \n\nWhat I love about this movie is that it\u2019s not just a comedic spoof of Star Trek. I really enjoyed the story which had a surprising number of endearing moments. \n\nSome of my favorites lines in this movie:\n\n*lands on ship* \u2026\u2026.Aaaahhhhhhhhhh\n\nWait! Don\u2019t open that! It\u2019s an alien planet!!! Is there air?! You don\u2019t know!!!\u2026.sniff sniff\u2026seems like there is air\n\nWe have to get out of here before they kill guy!!\n\nGuy, you have a last name. Do I?!?! Do I?!?!?!\n\nBesides\u2026..hehehehehe, I just had this really interesting idea. Guy: Are you stoned?\n\nWell screw that!\n\nThe list goes on. If you haven\u2019t seen it, go watch it!!",

Scene had a sound and you could hear dog barking in the background. Effect of shot hiting mummy was very impressive for a time.  \n\nAfter seeing the film and not seeing that scene, I figured it mist have been cut for being too intense. But recently I  heard that not a single cut scene from this movie survived. Now I'm buffled, what have I seen? Was it from some other movie or something?",

        "content": "Didn\u2019t realize how blunt and aggressive it is in how it portrays the union as bad and the confederates as good. It\u2019s not grey about it at all lol it\u2019s very black and white.\n\nThe union soldiers are shown to be callous, cold, immoral, dishonest, and conniving. \n\nThe confederate soldiers are shown to be noble, moral, straight-shooting, and possessing of humanity and passion.\n\nI understand that the movie is not portraying the entirety of the two sides, but rather the Jayhawkers and the Bushwhackers. The Bushwhackers did horrible things during the conflict and I\u2019ve seen people online say that that provides the grayness to the portrayal of the two sides but the movie doesn\u2019t really show it that way lol. If you only go by the movie, you wouldn\u2019t think too badly of the Bushwhackers side at all. \n\nAs I understand it, Clint is a libertarian so being pro-states rights and anti-big federal government does line up. Plus, when you take into account how the book was written by a KKK member, it also comes together.\n\nFurthermore, while googling about all this stuff, I just found out that, according to Wikipedia at least, Clint Eastwood is a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, which is described as \u201can American neo-Confederate nonprofit organization of male descendants of Confederate soldiers that commemorates these ancestors, funds and dedicates monuments to them, and promotes the pseudohistorical Lost Cause ideology and corresponding white supremacy.\u201d\n\nSo that might also explain his sympathetic portrayal of that side.\n\nI def am one to appreciate a nuanced or grey portrayal of war times. Obv in conflicts, not all the \u201cgood guys\u201d are morally pure and not all the \u201cbad guys\u201d are evil for evil\u2019s sake. I can appreciate when good guys are shown to be less than perfect and when bad guys are bad for a reason or have nuggets of humanity in otherwise immoral crusades.\n\nBut this movie doesn\u2019t seem to do that, as far as I can grasp. The Union guys are evil, bad, vicious, backstabbing, and violent. The Confederacy are noble rebels that are betrayed when surrendering. The Union are like vindictive rabid dogs coming for the kill while that one young confederate soldier shows his humanity by proclaiming his fear of dying.\n\nObv there\u2019s way more to the film and I\u2019m not covering all that in this post, just this topic specifically. But man, as far as I know, Clint\u2019s character would\u2019ve been part of irl Bill Anderson\u2019s irl massacre where they killed like 160 civilians. Wouldn\u2019t expect that from the way the movie shows things lol.\n\nAnyone else have thoughts on this topic or watch the movie recently enough to have notes on this topic?",

        "content": "I was feeling really down and needed something to lift my spirits. Many in this sub suggested Little Miss Sunshine, and I\u2019m so glad they did.\n\nThe movie follows this messy, dysfunctional family on a chaotic road trip to support Olive, the youngest, in her dream of competing in a beauty pageant. The characters felt so real\u2014flawed but relatable\u2014and the humor struck a perfect balance between dark and heartwarming. Olive\u2019s innocence and determination completely stole my heart.\n\nBy the time the final pageant scene came around, I was laughing through tears. It was such a beautiful reminder that life doesn\u2019t have to be perfect to be meaningful, and even in the chaos, there\u2019s love and hope. Watching it felt like a much-needed hug.\n\n",

Anyone have any recommendations for some psychological thrillers similar to the ones listed. Movies that keep you guessing the whole way through or that have a really good twist at the end.
