        "title": "Emilia Perez and the lack of dialect coaches.",
        "content": "I just finished watching \u201cEmilia Perez\u201d and I have to say, the lack of attention to the Spanish language in this production is absolutely disappointing. It\u2019s baffling how a movie of this scale, with a cast full of internationally recognized actors, didn\u2019t invest in proper dialect coaching. Mexican audiences, myself included, are extremely upset by how the film handles the Spanish language\u2014or rather, \u201cbutchers\u201d it.  \n\nSelena Gomez doesn\u2019t even attempt to explain or adjust her poor pronunciation. Then there\u2019s Zo\u00eb Salda\u00f1a, whose character conveniently throws in a \u201cDeus ex machina\u201d explanation that she was born in the Dominican Republic to justify her accent. And Sofia Gascon? Her voice had to be AI generated because she couldn\u2019t even sing the notes of the songs. \n\nIt\u2019s as if the production, being French, didn\u2019t even bother to take the language seriously. The songs\u2014written in French and awkwardly translated into Spanish\u2014make little to no sense, and it\u2019s painfully obvious. It feels like they threw words together without understanding cultural nuances, making the whole thing feel artificial and disconnected from its supposed Mexican setting.  \n\nThis brings me to the larger issue: why is it that English or Australian actors go through extensive dialect training when portraying American accents (e.g., Andrew Lincoln, Kelly Reilly, Andrew Garfield), yet \u201cEmilia Perez\u201d gets away with such a glaring lack of effort? Even Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal trained extensively to sound like a Spaniard in Almod\u00f3var\u2019s \u201cLa Mala Educaci\u00f3n\u201d, proving that the right effort -can- and -should- be made.  \n\nAnd yet, despite all of this, the Academy is showering the film with nominations. It\u2019s disheartening to see how -actual- Mexican films, with authenticity and cultural accuracy, don\u2019t receive this level of recognition. Instead, we get a film that diminishes the importance of language and cultural representation, all for the sake of style over substance. Imaging making an Italian language movie where Brad Pitt keeps his Italian in  \u201cInglorious Basterds\u201d not as a comedy but as a serious drama, that was this movie. A joke. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m sad and disappointed. Mexican culture and language deserve better.",

        "content": "Was thinking about this. Spielberg and Lucas have long said that \"Indiana Jones\" was born from their desire to make a James Bond film, mixed with the 1930s action serials they also used to love. There's a bunch of James Bond castings in the Indiana Jones franchise - namely Sean Connery, but also Allison Doody and Julian Glover as well.\n\nAnother example is \"Joker\" taking cues from DeNiro films \"Taxi Driver\" and \"The King of Comedy,\" with them ultimately casting Robert DeNiro in their film as well.\n\nWhat other examples exist of this? A movie inspires another movie, so they cast folks from that first movie in this one. ",

It's a very stage play performance, but it's so fun to watch. [The curse in The Lighthouse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3vcK-ppzqE&amp;ab_channel=TheOncomingStorm) alone is one of the greatest pieces of acting I've ever seen.

You are taught to be so macho and not as emotional. This definitely not only deserves the best animated Oscar, but really should have been nominated in the best pictures of the year too.

        "title": "What are scenes cut/deleted from a film that SHOULDNT have been cut out?",
        "content": "Deleted scenes have always fascinated me. There are quite a few infamous cut out sequences. Some have been put back in alternate or extended cuts, others released as bonus features, and some have never seen the light of day. Others were scripted but never even filmed.\n\nThe ones that come to mind for me are Michael Corleone killing Fabrizo in Godfather part 1(apparently part of this scene was shot before it got cut and the idea saved for part 2 where it was cut again). There\u2019s a picture of this sequence, or part of it, where Michael apparently shoots Fabrizio with a shot gun. No idea where would it would fit in but the pictures are floating around the internet. I can see why it was cut but it\u2019s something id love to see. \n\nSuperman TMP. Added to the special edition but cut from theatrical is a sequence where Lex Luthor tests Superman\u2019s powers before he can enter Lex\u2019s underground lair. He shoot\u2019s Superman with machine gun bullets, sets him on fire and then freezes him whole. It\u2019s a fun sequence with some cool FX. Even the director, Richard Donner, on the dvd commentary is puzzled why he ever cut the scene.\n\n\nI always loved the Sentry Gun sequence in Aliens which was added back in for the special edition. \n\nGhostbusters 2 has a number of deleted scenes. Many have never been seen. One that\u2019s never been seen is Ray getting possessed by Vigo and crashing the Ecto 1A(remnants of this scene remain in the first montage sequence where we see Peter in the back of the Ecto 1 looking repeatedly to Ray whose running a red light.)\n\n\nAnother from GB2 but has been released which is Dana addressing the fact that she\u2019s involved in another paranormal event and so is there something that makes her vulnerable to these situations? This one is good because it makes light of something we the audience are thinking about. Dana Barrett just so happened to walk in that Slime?Out of all the people it was her AND she has a baby the bad guy wants? After what happened in the first film? Really?\n\nThe alternate ending of Little Shop of Horrors works way better in my opinion. Much darker. But funnier. Great miniature work.\n\nSpider-Man 2 has an extended cut which some extra bits of action on the train but more than anything there\u2019s a scene with MJ and her friend going shoe shopping that I love. It really delves into who MJ is and her friend really gives a nice performance. Plus J Jonah Jameson trying on the Spidey suit is GREAT, the one brought in by garbage man\n\nKill Bill. Ok. This is an interesting one. The Kill Bill that\u2019s been released(both volumes) is not the Kill Bill originally planned. QT wrote an earlier draft and he cut out what I consider to be the best chapter in the entire saga. \u201cYuki\u2019s Revenge\u201d. This was never filmed. And it\u2019s a damn shame. Gogo has a twin sister and she tracks down Beatrix right after killing Vernita Green. In the film we hear an Ice Cream Truck roaming Vernitas neighborhood. In the script? That\u2019s Yuki and shes found The Brusge and they both go on destroying the neighborhood in an explosive action sequence. Beyond that, there\u2019s a version of the film called \u201cKill Bill The Whole Bloody Affair\u201d which combines both parts into one film. The House of Blue Leaves is in color and extended(as it was , Extended anime sequence, a new anime sequence but most importantly? We, the audience, spend the entire film thinking Beatrix lost her baby. We don\u2019t find out until SHE finds out that BB is alive. I can only imagine the power of this sequence. It removed the stinger from the end of volume 1 where Bill reveals the truth.\n\nSo those are some of my favourites. I have more but don\u2019t want to name them all.\n\n What are yours?",

        "content": "It\u2019s been a good while since I saw a decent comedy movie so I revisited this 90s gem called mouse hunt. It\u2019s directed by gore verbinski who if you know about his work, would later go on to direct a remake of a famous horror movie after making this one. This movie is just nonstop slapstick which I really enjoyed about it. From the moment the brothers enter the rundown mansion they inherited from their grandfather and seeing the pesky mouse, it\u2019s pretty much a montage of the brothers implementing various techniques to get rid of it such as with a homicidal cat and a exterminator who acts in a odd manner. I will say although this movie is rated PG, it just have some iffy content sprinkled throughout but I guess no one will notice because they\u2019ll be too focused on the pratfalls that occur throughout as the main characters try and fail again and again to capture the mouse. So if you ever wanted to see a live action Tom and Jerry or just want to watch movies in the vain of the three stooges, then you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised with this flick \n\nReview 8/10",

        "content": "For me, there are two: The Return of the King and Kong: Skull Island. I watched both movies in the last 4 days, and also watch the first two LOTR movies after Skull Island and before TROTK.\n\nI'll give more attention to the last one because it depends less on the rest of movie itself than the ending of TROTK, which, despite being more emotional, is so because it is a farewell to a journey, both for the film's protagonists and for those who watched them. \n\nOn the other hand, the ending of Skull Island is almost completely independent of the rest of the movie. Of course, it's more beautiful when you've seen the movie, especially because of Gunpei's katana and the hot dog and cold beer while watching a Cubs game. But even so, you can show this scene to someone who hasn't seen the film and that person will perfectly understand the scene and what it means for the characters involved, and this without any speech other than the sports commentator saying that the impossible dream became the possible dream.",

        "content": "I think a good part of here knows the story behind the first casting of the protagonist of \"Back to the Future\". Michael J. Fox was not available and Eric Stoltz was chosen. But his type of acting was not suitable for what was a comedy, he was fired and MJF who had become available was called. The rest is history.\n\nBut recently I saw an interview with Lea Thompson (who plays Marty McFly's mother, Lorraine Baines).\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-\\_lWQhgLYA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-_lWQhgLYA)\n\nHere she tells an interesting anecdote. After the first reading of the script with the actors they are all enthusiastic, the story is great everyone laughs etc etc. Then they ask Eric what he thinks and he says it is a tragedy. Because at the end of the film Marty remembers a past and a family that no longer exists. His new family are strangers who have lived a totally different life. And this new family has lost a son, because at home they have a stranger who coincidentally has the same name.\n\nAnd I add, the movie tells us that all this is perfectly okay why? Because now Marty has a nicer house, he has a new car, he has so many *things*. Marty has lost his whole life but in exchange he has so many new material goods. And this is the essence of the American Dream, as long as you have things (goods, money, power, fame), everything else (love, family, beliefs) can be sacrificed.\n\n(I think that even Crispin Glover - who played Marty's dad, was very critical about the movie message: money and financial success = happiness)",
