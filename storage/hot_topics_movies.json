        "content": "Hey, Reddit! I\u2019m Reza Dahya and my feature film debut, BOXCUTTER (SXSW 2025), hits digital platforms on 11/21! It features rising star Ashton James as an aspiring rapper seeking his big break in Toronto\u2019s music industry. AMA!\n\nHere's the trailer:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L5b1IeeSHQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L5b1IeeSHQ)\n\n**About Boxcutter:**\n\n&gt;Aspiring rapper Rome has the talent and the vision to break out in Toronto's hip-hop scene but his crippling insecurity is holding him back. When he learns that megastar producer Richie Hill will be making an appearance at a local club, Rome seizes the chance to meet him and get him his album. However, disaster strikes when Rome\u2019s apartment is burglarized and the only copy of his album is stolen. Racing across the city with his friend Jenaya, Rome scrambles to track down his collaborators, and his records, before he misses his one shot. Set against Toronto\u2019s gentrifying streets and its vibrant music scene, BOXCUTTER features an authentic look into Toronto\u2019s creative arts community with fixtures like Rich Kidd (2-time Juno-winning artist, produced songs for Drake, DMX, Jay Electronica and more), Clairmont the Second (Juno, Polaris &amp; Prism-nominated artist), RUSSELL! (R&amp;B singer/producer) and Junia-T (the official DJ for global superstar Jessie Reyez) all making appearances.\n\n**About Director Reza Dahya:**\n\n&gt;Reza Dahya is known for his work as a host and producer of OTA Live on FLOW 93.5 FM in Toronto. He transitioned into filmmaking with his short films, ESHA and the crowd-funded FIVE DOLLARS, which premiered at the TIFF Kids International Film Festival, screened internationally and aired on CBC\u2019s \"Canadian Reflections\". A 2015 alumnus of the CFC Directors\u2019 Lab, Dahya completed his CFC Short Film, CHAMELEON, the independent THE WORST PART and is currently releasing his feature film debut, BOXCUTTER (SXSW, 2025).\n\nFor additional information: [https://filmmovement.com/boxcutter](https://filmmovement.com/boxcutter)\n\nAsk me anything! I'll be back tomorrow Friday 11/21 at 3 PM ET at to answer any questions.\n\n",

Keep in mind, these children (ages ranging from 8-18) have no formal combat training. But they do have home field advantage and they have the numbers (at least a couple dozen of them vs 1 man). \n\nMy prediction, instead of taking a full day, John Rambo defeats them in less than 2 hours.",

        "title": "Movies I never could have imagined: \"Milk Money\"",
        "content": "Where to begin?\n\nI guess for starters, how the hell did they get Ed Harris and Malcolm McDowell to star in this movie? Okay, Malcolm McDowell, maybe not as surprising. But Ed Harris was in *Apollo 13* the following year, so I'm assuming they were both filmed around the same time. He was also in *The Abyss*, although that was years earlier. I guess his career hadn't really peaked at the time of *Milk Money*, but still. I really wish I could ask him how that all went down.\n\nFor those of you who, like me, had never heard of this movie until now, *Milk Money* is about a young boy who finds a hooker in the city, gets her stranded in the suburbs, and then tries to set her up with his dad so that she can be his mom. Basically the opposite of that episode of *The Boondocks.* It's one of the most bizarre romcoms I've ever seen. Actually, it's definitely the most bizarre romcom I've ever seen.\n\nThere's some obvious areas that are morally questionable to say the least (those of you who actually have seen this movie know exactly what I'm talking about). Nonetheless, *Milk Money* manages to be unexpectedly charming and at times, dare I say heartwarming. The characters are surprisingly likeable and there's some good dialogue in there, especially between Ed Harris and his son, and you can't help but root for Melanie Griffith to find herself a happy ending. Malcolm McDowell is practically a cartoon, but somehow the casting was appropriate \u2014 maybe because the character is so 1-dimensional that it was pretty much a requirement for the actor to be recognizable.\n\nWhile I never really got past how crazy the premise is, I'll admit that there were times I couldn't help but find myself actually watching this fucking thing. I mean really watching it.\n\nSo, what's next? Gimme some movies that I never in a million years would believe actually exist (ideally ones that at least have some redeeming qualities).",
