        "title": "Erin Brokovich is a great movie, but Erin herself is kind of awful",
        "content": "I\u2019m not commenting on the \\*real\\* Erin Brokovich, but on the character in the film.\n\nObviously, the character cares deeply about the evils being perpetrated by PG&amp;E and she wants justice for those affected. That\u2019s an admirable trait and it makes her easy to root for, because of course we want her to succeed and we want this major corporation to be held accountable.\n\nBut throughout the entire movie, Erin is awful to just about everyone else in her life except the plaintiffs.\n\n\u2022 She shows no appreciation toward the lady next door who had apparently been taking care of her kids for free.\n\n\u2022 She blames Ed Masry for losing her car accident case despite the fact that she\u2019s the one who blew up in court, and then she basically guilts/bullies him into giving her a job. Even after he does so (which he\u2019s under no obligation to do) and even gives her an advance on her paycheck on what seems like her first day, she continues to insult, disrespect, and degrade him throughout the entire film.\n\n\u2022 She\u2019s awful to all of her coworkers. Granted, some of them are very mean to her as well, but frankly I don\u2019t blame them. She makes fun of their weight, yells at them, and calls them bitches to their faces.\n\n\u2022 She\u2019s awful to George, who she basically treats as a free live-in nanny. When he confronts her about the way she treats him, she doesn\u2019t apologize or even acknowledge that she\u2019s done anything wrong. She also seemingly doesn\u2019t give a second thought to how her kids feel, since they spend most of their time with George at that point and would obviously be devastated by him leaving.\n\n\u2022 She\u2019s awful to the other legal team that Masry brings in to assist with the case, despite the fact that they\u2019re just doing their jobs and even bankrolled the whole thing. Theresa is definitely condescending toward her, but it\u2019s not in an intentional way. Erin never shows them even the slightest modicum of respect and acts from the beginning like they\u2019re incompetent and don\u2019t care about the plaintiffs.\n\nDoes this aspect of the movie bother anyone else? I kind of expected there to be a scene at some point where Erin apologized to\u2026 well, anyone. But in the film, she\u2019s always treated like she\u2019s in the right and like her behavior toward everyone is justified because of how much she cares about the case. I find this to be a really off-putting element in an otherwise great film.",

If a film hasn't given me a reason to care about the characters or the stakes within the first 20 minutes, I\u2019m out.\n\nFor me, it was Rebel Moon. It felt like a long ass screensaver with zero soul. I don't care how big the budget is or how much slow motion you use if the writing isn't there, I\u2019m not gonna care and I am not wasting my evening.\n\nWhat\u2019s that one movie that made you realize you were wasting your time and what was the reason that made you turn it off?",

        "content": "For starters, Animal Logic's animation alone is simply brilliant and takes direct inspiration from the early \"brick films\" you'd see on YouTube merged with the trippy insanity of The Matrix. The stereoscopic 3D does wonders for it.\n\nSecondly, Phil Lord and Chris Miller's script/ direction strikes that perfect balance between chaos, silliness, biting commentary and human pathos; the kind of stuff that directly mocks the Hollywood system while still honoring it in its own strange way. Some of the themes feel especially (and unfortunately) relevant in 2026.\n\nAnd as overexposed/controversial as he is today, Chris Pratt puts in a wonderful performance as Emmet, the everyman who doesn't really know how to do anything but also has the biggest heart in the world. Heck, pretty much everyone in the cast puts in a great performance, even the ones doing a brief cameo.\n\nWhat a film man\u2026",

        "content": "Ok, I'm well aware of the superior quality of Blu-ray over say DVD but am curious if there are any films you would say are enhanced beyond the norm in their Blu-ray version?\n\nI am thinking Interstellar and Inception as two that spring to mind (obv, both Christopher Nolan films), but any where the Blu-ray just opens up the film experience beyond your expectations?\n\nThanks",

Pacific Rim is a movie I can watch over and over but it\u2019s just as good as the first time.  The Departed was so much better the second time I watched it, and I can say the same for Casino, Goodfellas, The Wolf Of Wall Street and The Godfather series. ",

A spot that sold you completely, without any reservation that you were going to see the movie. Even if the film turned out bad, you still have a fondness for the trailer itself\u2026 personally, mine would be 2010\u2019s Clash of the Titans. Even with mixed reviews, me agreeing with most of the dislikes of the film - the Bird and the Worm trailer catapults the movie itself into a cult love for it. ",

        "content": "This might be obvious to some people, but I haven\u2019t really seen it framed this way before.\n\nLots of analyses say Phil breaks out of the loop when he becomes selfless / grows morally. I buy that. But I realized the Groundhog Day myth itself lines up almost too perfectly:\n\nThe groundhog \u201cseeing its shadow\u201d is literally seeing itself \u2014 and when that happens, winter continues. Spring only comes when it doesn\u2019t see itself.\n\nThat feels like exactly Phil\u2019s problem. As long as he only sees Phil \u2014 his ego, his desires, his boredom, even his despair \u2014 the loop keeps going. Time only moves forward when he stops being self-referential and actually looks outward.\n\nSo, it\u2019s not just \u201cbe nice and you\u2019re free,\u201d but \u201cstop seeing yourself as the center of meaning.\u201d The holiday myth ends up mirroring the character arc.\n\nCurious if anyone\u2019s seen this connection made explicitly before, or if I\u2019m just late to the party.",

He seems professional and all business - not cruel or sadistic. So why this game?\n\nIt almost seems out of character. What do you all think?",
