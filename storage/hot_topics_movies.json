This it does not by trying to reinvent the wheel but, rather smartly, by addressing the elephant in the room, locating the action in a kitsch yet somehow timeless retro-future more befitting *The Jetsons* than *The Avengers*. It also benefits from a smart script and \u2014 I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m writing this \u2014 really quite moving performances from its four charismatic leads, being arguably the best of Pedro Pascal\u2019s releases this year.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review-1236466922/) (80):\n\n&gt;True to its subtitle, the film feels like a fresh start. And like this summer\u2019s blockbuster \u201cSuperman\u201d reboot over at DC, that could be just what it takes to win back audiences suffering from superhero exhaustion.\n\n[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/the-fantastic-four-first-steps/) (80):\n\n&gt;With an exemplary cast and shiny new alt-universe to enjoy, this is the best Fantastic Four yet. And if that bar\u2019s too low for you, then it\u2019s also the best Marvel movie in years.\n\n[Slashfilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1918790/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review/) (90):\n\n&gt;The Fantastic Four: First Steps is set in a world that I wouldn't mind living in. Even if there are occasional, ineffable cosmic deities plotting to devour me, and terrifying silver aliens ripping my soul apart with their eyes. \"First Steps\" is a superhero movie where we're already better. And I love that.\n\n[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2025/07/22/fantastic-four-first-steps-marvel-movie-review/85302239007/) (75):\n\n&gt;After two mediocre 2000s film featuring Marvel\u2019s legendary superhero family, and an atrocious third outing in 2015, the foursome makes its Marvel Cinematic Universe debut in a combo sci-fi/disaster flick full of retrofuturistic 1960s flavor.\n\n[Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review-pedro-pascal-leads-team-back-retro-future-11776476) (75):\n\n&gt;From its Saul Bass-inspired opening credits to its callbacks to Saturday morning superhero cartoons, it practically vibrates with its sense of time and place.\n\n[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review-pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby-ebon-moss-bachrach-joseph-quinn) (70):\n\n&gt;These First Steps might not be the great strides I was hoping for, but they are sure footing for the Fantastic Four to officially leap into the MCU.\n\n[The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/fantastic-four-first-steps-review-b2793808.html) (60):\n\n&gt;In fact, all the ingredients are perfectly lined up here, and, in the right combinations, and with the pure wonderment of Michael Giacchino\u2019s score, The Fantastic Four: First Steps does shimmer with a kind of wide-eyed idealism. And that\u2019s lovely.\n\nDirected by Matt Shakman:\n\n&gt;On the 1960s-inspired retro-futuristic alternate universe known as Earth-828. the Fantastic Four must protect their world from the planet-devouring cosmic being Galactus and his herald, the Silver Surfer.\n\n\nCast:\n\n* Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards / Mister Fantastic\n* Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm / Invisible Woman\n* Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm / The Thing\n* Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm / Human Torch\n* Julia Garner as Shalla-Bal / Silver Surfer\n* Paul Walter Hauser as Harvey Elder / Mole Man\n* Ralph Ineson as Galactus",

        "content": "For those of you who might be into surreal movies like what David Lynch and Ingmar Bergman make.  I just recently found this and loved it.  The acting and script are good for a low budget movie but the cinematography and the haunting imagery is what really stands out.  The director of the movie Henk Harvey also plays a role in the movie as shown in the image for the link.  ",

        "content": "First off I think my serotonin and dopamine levels were just insanely high watching this movie because the amount of joy I got watching these corrupt cops get their ass beat was chef kiss. I think the irony of this movie was that the main character never once shot a bullet (that could kill) the entire time! He was able to disarm, capture, and defend without ever using a firearm and THAT is such an ironic twist that I absolutely loved. It was clearly a movie about political reform and corruption within the policing system and it was done in a way that wasn\u2019t a cliche. It was too long for me to want to rewatch it anytime soon but I would easily watch it just to dissect the movie. I give it a 8.5/10 but the premise of the story and the actors who played in this movie were phenomenal. I can see why it\u2019s Emmy nominated.",

Would it look like trash?\n\nI\u2019m here to say that the town is \u2014 geographically and physically \u2014 almost exactly as it is depicted! The population is a little smaller than implied, and obviously there are no shootouts in the streets. But other than that, you could go to Truth or Consequences and retrace most of the scenes step-by-step. Our Bullocks grocery store, the side streets with arched doorways, the Geronimo museum with the statue of Geronimo. Garcia\u2019s Bar is even there (though it\u2019s not open). The only thing he left out was all our hot springs spas (the name used to be \u201cHot Springs, NM\u201d). And the sheriff\u2019s house was filmed in Santa Fe, judging by the trees. \n\nAri Aster is himself a New Mexican, and he showed respect to our dusty little town by not dressing it up, and not running it down. No imaginary geography, just a few out-of-place residences, but otherwise it\u2019s T or C. I appreciated that. ",

It's like a spiritual successor to the show.\n\n\nI also love how this is sort of a satirization of John Wick. Instead of someone breaking into Keanu's home and killing his dog, someone &gt;!breaks into Peele's house and abducts his cat Keanu!&lt; lmao.\n\n\n\nI would also like to shout out Luis Guzm\u00e1n for being hilarious in this despite his very brief appearance.",
