        "content": "Seriously, how good was this movie? Twenty years later, it still holds up. Their depiction of 2027 didn't have flying cars or any crazy shit like that, in fact, it seems pretty spot on in terms of how the world actually looks from a technological standpoint. Less people glued to their phones, but perhaps the director was more optimistic than the movie let on.\n\nThat said, the film certainly did have its own flavour. The  shaky cam shots and tracking sequences were just as cool and engaging as the first time I'd seen the movie 15 years ago and brought about a sense of realism. True to this theme, the characters were human through and through, flawed, likeable, and relatable.\n\nClive Owen is a cynical alcoholic with a sad past, but as we see, is incapable of being anything short of a good man. His pot head friend in Michael Caine is similar in this regard. Serving both as comedic relief and the voice of reason despite being a stoner who lives in the woods. Kee, the first mother in over 18 years, is a far-cry from the Virgin Mary. Not only does she not know who the father is, she doesn't know \"who any of the wankers were.\"\n\nThen we have that ceasefire scene where we see the human side of a government that is initially portrayed as inhumanly cruel and oppressive. For as long as it lasts, it's a touching moment (and one of many scenes that makes great use of contrast -- the bombing at the beginning, Julie Anne-Moore being killed out of nowhere... there was never a moment where you could allow yourself to relax).\n\nI'm gonna leave the depictions of anti-immigrant sentiments alone, but you're free to discuss the relevance of that part amongst yourself.\n\nAnyways, what did you think of *Children of Men*?",

It should be as revered as Isabelle Adjani in \"Possession\". \n\nThe TV show never gave us a fully fledged portrait of Laura Palmer but in \"Fire Walk with Me\", we get to see who she is, how she lived in a constant state of panic, fear and brooding resignation. Her self-destruction through a promiscuous life was her way of escaping from the abuse inflicted in her home and the conflicted emotions she had for her abuser. \n\nLaura didn't want to live, death was her way of wanting to escape, wanting the angel to save her from BOB and all the pain and anger inflicted on her. Not even the love she got from James and Donna was enough. \n\nI absolutely adore this movie by David Lynch. I even think Moira Kelly was a better Donna than Lara Flynn Boyle (whom I always found to be miscast).",

        "content": "I think by now it's common knowledge that Richard Pryor (who was a co-writer from the start) was Mel Brooks' first choice to play Bart - the role that went to Cleavon Little. The money weasels claimed that Pryor's drug convictions made him uninsurable...\n\nWhat fascinates me more however is the fact that Books seems to have really wanted an older actor to play the Gene Wilder part - the Waco Kid. His top choice was John Wayne, who declined but said he'd be first in line to see it. Next he wanted Dan Dailey, whose film credits begin in 1940. Finally they tried Gig Young (b. 1913), who collapsed on the first day of shooting from alcohol withdrawal (*he* was insurable?). That's when they finally said screw it and flew in Gene, nobody's choice but available *and* insurable.\n\nThink about how different Blazing Saddles would have been with Brooks' first choices in the main roles! It's comical to even think about, which might have been Brooks' intention all along. It's a little nugget of humor buried in the back story of the film itself, a lasting legacy.",

        "content": "I think this is such a great concept for a bleak film,  but I just can't think of many that take advantage of it. I'm sure there are a bunch of horror films, but I really struggle to think of any other films that play this completely straight -  usually if it ends with the protagonist losing then they made a mistake somewhere along the line.\n\nI'd exclude biopics and movies in series from this as they are part of a larger story (eg: Empire Strikes Back ends with Han being frozen and Luke losing to Vader, but you know it's only the middle of the story) \n\nI'm sure I'm missing obvious ones but one of the only examples I can think of is actually Don't Look Up, where the main characters are correct, try to warn everyone, do it as well as they can... but it doesn't make any difference.",

        "title": "How did the 3D experience die out?",
        "content": "Apparently, I was just thinking about a while back how 3D was big for a while before dying out. We had 3D Blu-ray's, 3D movies, 3D TV's and 3D channels for a time. But this is where I found out that 3D was such a gimmick to audiences.\n\n&gt;The post-credits scene for Thor was originally filmed with 3D cameras, and it was created by The Avengers director Joss Whedon. Originally intended as a test to determine whether The Avengers would be shot in 3D, it resulted in Kevin Feige being discouraged from the process entirely moving forward. It was so difficult, that it was described as \"being an abysmal experience.\"\n\n&gt;The post-credits scene was a roughly 90-second clip and consists of little more than the meeting of Samuel Jackson's Nick Fury and Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd's Erik Selvig setting up the MCU's future. However, despite the seeming simplicity of the scene, the decision to shoot it with 3D cameras caused the filming process to be unnecessarily long. Jeremy Latcham, an executive producer on The Avengers, described the tedious shoot. He said, \"It took so long to change a lens that it was truly awful. It was the longest day to shoot that tiny, tiny scene.\"\n\n&gt;Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd's experience filming the post-credits scene caused him to ask Jeremy Latcham whether this would be how the next film was shot, and if it were so, then he would not be starring in it. Luckily, he was able to appear in The Avengers because they didn't shoot the movie in 3D.\n\nI think that the problem was that it was a gimmick to the audience, it was expensive and the novelty would wear out after a while. Plus, a lot of the 3D conversions were terrible (e.g. Clash of the Titans and any movie that had its 3D conversion rushed to cash-in on the success of Avatar). Look at 2010 where 60% of Shrek: Forever After's opening weekend came from 3D sales post-Avatar and by 2011, 40% of Kung Fu Panda 2's opening weekend came from 3D sales. That is a noticeable decline\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are still 3D movies being released but not as often as they were 5-10 years ago (Captain America: Brave New World is getting a 3D release next month). I just think the problem with 3D was that it proved to be a gimmick with audiences and the good 3D conversions were the ones shot in 3D like Avatar and stuff like that.",

Something like [The Act of Killing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Act_of_Killing), or a youtube documentary I saw years ago of a guy that went to live among the cartel.",
