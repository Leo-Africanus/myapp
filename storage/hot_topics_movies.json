        "content": "I appreciate the 007 story and want to see good James Bond movies arrive.\n\nBut spying is not the same game it was in the 20th Century, and the stories we are getting are increasingly bizarre and implausible, and it just doesn\u2019t work to shoehorn 007 into the current year.\n\nSo let\u2019s bring 007 not only back to the beginning, but let\u2019s start him as a brand new British spy during World War II, behind the front lines. There could be an entire trilogy of material just set in WWII, and we could see Felix as a brand new OSS agent.\n\nThe story has a defined enemy: Nazis. And a megalomaniac: Hitler. But to avoid counterfactualism, 007 should do a realistic intelligence gathering mission in Lisbon and occupied Paris. (Maybe he is tasked with something small but thinks he has a chance at assassinating Hitler and tries but misses and has to escape.)\n\nThen, there\u2019s the whole second half of the 1940s to mine for good stories. The point of this post is that I think we\u2019re hitting our heads against the wall trying to make a 21st century story about a 20th century character. So reboot the series and put 007 back to the beginning: his first op in WWII.",

But that\u2019s what makes it stand out. Love it or hate it, you have to admit it takes guts to go there.\n\nIt\u2019s one of those films that sticks with you, whether you want it to or not.",

        "title": "Few directors have ever had a streak of top notch films like Rob Reiner did for the first decade of his film directing career. And few have ever had that streak end so spectacularly with the likes of \"North.\"",
        "content": "Seriously, these are the first seven films Reiner directed:\n\n1984: \"This is Spinal Tap\"\n\n1985: \"The Sure Thing\"\n\n1986: \"Stand By Me\n\n1987: \"The Princess Bride\"\n\n1989: \"When Harry Met Sally\"\n\n1990: \"Misery\"\n\n1992: \"A Few Good Men\"\n\nThat is an INSANE streak of excellent films, several of which are classics. The least of them is probably \"The Sure Thing\" and that's a charming, funny 80s teen spin on \"It Happened One Night\" that made John Cusack a leading man. And especially impressive is how diverse they are, ranging from the best music mockumentary ever to one of the greatest coming of age films ever to a gold standard romantic coming of age film to one of the most beloved fantasy/family films of all time. Reiner really seemed like he could do no wrong...\n\n...and then he made \"North\" and that streak ended in a crashing halt that promptly exploded. \"North\" was the kind of disaster made by a director on an insane hot streak who thought he could not miss and thus had a blank check to make his pet project which he clearly thought was going to be a modern \"Wizard of Oz.\" Instead, it became a massive bomb that is now best known for being the subject of one of Siskel and Ebert's greatest reviews. And regrettably, Reiner's never been the same as a director since. (He did rebound with \"The American President\" as his next film, but Aaron Sorkin was much more the driving creative force on that one and his directing career since has been scattershot at best.) But at least he'll always have that awesome directoral decade to look back on with well-deserved pride.",

        "title": "Ghostbusters: Afterlife...Egon's exile doesn't make sense",
        "content": "Finally got around to watching *Ghostbusters: Afterlife* recently, and one of the main plot points isn't making sense to me: Egon's estrangement and self-imposed exile from the rest of the team. \n\nRay tells Phoebe that Egon called him and told him everything he'd discovered in the mine, but gives no reasons at all why he didn't believe him. Maybe Winston and Venkman had moved on to other things and thought Egon was just trying to relive the glory days, but Ray's the most enthusiastic of all of them about the paranormal. Egon's quirky but we never see him being anything other than levelheaded and methodical. When Egon tells him he discovered a Gozer-worship temple in an old mine Ivo Shandor used to mine the materials for the NYC building (not like it's a secret who owned it, his name's on the thing as well as half the buildings in the town), and *Ivo Shandor himself* is in a sarcophagus there, and it appears it's being used as another attempt to bring Gozer back into our world, why wouldn't Ray at least go have a look? \n\nThe reasoning that he was sore at Egon for taking off abruptly with most of their equipment seems weak. At most that might explain why Ray *initially* hung up on him, but Egon was out in Oklahoma for years. In all that time someone as intensely curious about the paranormal as Ray wouldn't have second thoughts and decide to go out and see if his old friend and long-standing academic and business partner who he know extremely well might be telling the truth? At the very least, since Janine obviously knows exactly where Egon is and is in direct contact with him, Ray couldn't have reached out to her and asked what's going on with him?\n\nI know the 'real' reason is that the plot required it to happen, obviously. I liked the movie quite a lot overall and thought it was a very worthy sequel to the original (I did find it funny they pretended *Ghostbusters 2* never happened). Just seemed like an oddly weak spot in an otherwise good movie. ",

I'm especially curious to know if there has been a performance where someone has surprised you and made a passable attempt.\n\nI feel that there's a lot of effort made to either get an accent right or get weapons and fight training but not nearly as much effort when it comes to languages which I can understand because the few people will notice.",

        "content": "One for me was a teen comedy/drama period piece set in the 60s about an all-boys high school called Heaven Help Us. A very sweet, underrated movie. Stars Andrew McCarthy. One of the major sub plots involves a brother/teacher in this religious school and he's abusive in a realistic way. It's disturbing. He enjoys the corporal punishment he inflicts on the students. \n\nAs the movie nears the end... something happens where McCarthy finally fights back from the abuse and it's such a moment, such a rush for me I've never forgotten that feeling. Anyone have that with another film?",

They added it to Hulu and I was looking for something to watch while I work on some projects. \n\nDANG I totally forgot how many amazing actors they got for this film.  Mark Wahlberg, Zoey Deschanel, John Leguizamo, and I was surprised to see Alan Ruck and Jeremy Strong too. \n\nThe actors are soooo good but the dialogue is SO bad that it makes them all look like it\u2019s their first time performing. And the story line is like\u2026 idk definitely interesting enough to keep you watching. It\u2019s really my favorite combo. \n\nI find it hilarious that they keep some things out of view of the audience (people shooting themselves in the head) then 10 minutes later show a man voluntarily feeding his own arm to a lion. The direction is absolutely insane. \n\nWell worth a rewatch imo if you haven\u2019t seen it in a while and are looking for something entertaining. ",

        "content": "if you rewatch the film, you'd notice another scene with the ripples at the end of the movie, when he talks with einstein. both scenes tells different stories:\n\n1. the ripple sequence in the beginning tells how oppenheimer is curious and intrigued by \"a different universe\"-a different perspective of the quantum world and how he goes on, driven by curiosity.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tr1h0e3k4e8e1.png?width=225&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72854e44d7b8b98f9b4f7e0016b5aaa201c91c90\n\n2. after the bombing, he becomes devastated by the impact his invention had on the world. so the 2nd sequence which comes at the end depicts the catastrophic consequences of his own creation, tells us how he imagines that he had done 'a chain reaction' and he got 'blood on his hands'.\n\nthe ripples also evoke a sense of universal interconnectedness, echoing oppenheimer\u2019s own view of science, life, and morality. They suggest how small actions in one domain (e.g. theoretical physics) can have cosmic, even existential, consequences.\n\nits so awesome how nolan had this level of creativity of showing the same scene having different interpretations in different timelines to the audience",
