That fascinates me. Also, that's art! It isn't supposed to comfort you.\n\nBeau is Afraid is a masterpiece (Also, Eddington is so relevant and if you liked No Country, check it out in context of modern politics and that we no longer have a shared reality).\n\nBut Beau makes people with panic attacks feel \"seen\". It's an unreal Odyssey. Also one of my favorite films ever.\n\nSo, apparently I like that chaos and tension. I think it's also why I like horror: it's a way to parse my own anxiety, channel it, and realize that life could always be worse. LOL\n\nWhat other films feel like a panic attack, or pure anxiety, or that you might have a heart attack from the tension?",
