There would be a large Starbucks type seating area where I could grab breakfast while I look at my laptop. An hour or so later, I go see an early screening. Once that\u2019s done, I go for a walk or hit the gym. I then go back to the theater but need to get some work done before seeing my next movie. I reserve a sound proof work booth where I can zoom into a meeting. \n\nOnce done I\u2019m ready to see another movie, but this time order lunch which is delivered to my seat in the movie theatre. \n\nWhen that done, it\u2019s time to meet a friend who\u2019s also a big fan of a show on Netflix. We get some beers and head over to semi private booths that have 32 inch screens and watch an episode or two together. My friend has to take off for a party but asks if I want to join. \n\nIt\u2019s been a long day but I say sure. Turns out the party is right here in my dream theater complex. We walk over to one of the private screening rooms.  Big enough for no more than 20 guests at a time but also good for socializing. It\u2019s someone\u2019s birthday and everyone chipped in to pay to for a screening room viewing watch a the guest of honors two favorite movies, \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d and \u201cCannibal Holocaust\u201d. \n\nWe laugh. We cry. We vomit. I meet a girl who\u2019s really impressed with my extensive knowledge of found footage horror and she gives me her number. But soon we have to leave because the room is reserved for Karaoke at 10 pm. \n\nI go home, go to bed. And do it all over again the next day. \n\n",

There\u2019s the seedy motels. The downtown courthouse. The posh private school. The jalousie windows. The incessant cricketing of crickets. The music does a good deal of the heavy lifting. That base line alone is both tongue in cheek and moody. Just like the movie. The script is full of twists and turns. None need to make sense when you\u2019re having this much fun. The cast is more than game. If Bill Murray graces your set you must be doing something right. You also get a vintage Denise Richards on full display. I saw this in the theater and couldn\u2019t believe these mainstream actors were going all out exploitation on us. Find this flick and make it your next movie night. You may have to shower after this one\u2026. Enjoy!",
