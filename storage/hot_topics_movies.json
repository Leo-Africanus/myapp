        "title": "The Total Recall movie fixed a huge dumb problem with the original short story",
        "content": "I've loved Total Recall for years so I wanted to finally read the short story it was based on, \"We Can Remember It For You Wholesale\" by Philip K Dick. And the short story is... kinda dumb, even compared to a Schwartzeneggar movie. Specifically this one aspect.\n\nThe story and movie are vastly different, but the setup is basically the same in both.\n\nStory and movie: An ordinary man is bored with his average life on earth and endlessly dreams of having adventures on Mars. He discovers a company called Rekal, which boasts it can implant 100% convincing false memories into your mind. He pays for the memory of an epic adventure on Mars in which he's a badass action hero spy. The procedure fails catastrophically because he actually IS a badass spy and just doesn't remember it.\n\nIn the movie, they made a very wise change. Rekal in the film makes sense as a business. Rekal is basically an entertainment company. You have a memory of a thrilling adventure, then it ends and you go back to your life. It's like a movie. You know it wasn't real and yet you have the satisfied feeling of coming home from an epic vacation, only with no personal risk and a lot less financial burden.\n\nHere's what immediately bugged me about the short story. In the story, Rekal is supposed to convince you that their fake memories are real. Period. They give you fake \"souvenirs\" from your adventure. They delete the last couple weeks of your real memories. They even delete your memories of coming to Rekal. You will just wake up at home after your \"adventure\" is over.\n\nMy issue: How is that supposed to work? They expect you to believe you're a spy assassin, but still show up for your shift at T Mobile? To just keep waiting on new orders from the agency that will never show up? What if you try to tell your wife? She'll correctly assume you're insane. What if you get mugged? You'll think you can do John Wick moves on the gunman and then get shot in the face. How can you live an ordinary life believing you're basically a superhero? Rekal is pretty much a company that charges you to ruin your life.",

        "title": "I have a deep love for the movie MONEYBALL. Here's why...",
        "content": "Moneyball is a 2011 film. It was directed by Bennett Miller and adapted by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin. \n\nI have seen the movie over 15 times. It took me a while to figure out why I am such a huge fan. Turns out quite a few people on reddit feel the same way. But I think most of the reviews actually miss why the movie resonates so deeply. Here is my theory. It comes down to four things: \n\n**1. It uses the subject of Baseball to show society's evolution into the digial/computer age.** Of course, this is never mentioned in the film. But the real underlying story is how computing technology will eventually disrupt our old way of life. And how some people will kick and scream to stop it, but it is inevitable. Those who identify it first will have the edge. Billy Beane and Pete represent the digital, new way of thinking. The manager and scouts represent the analog age. In a sense it is the most important issue of our time, and it tells it through baseball, America's most beloved, but aging institution...genius. \n\n**2. It is a love/hate letter to capitalism and therefore, America**. Again, never mentioned explicitly. But Moneyball is also a story about all the evil and beauty of capitalism. It is a story about how capitalism serves the ultra-wealthy and creates an unfair advantage for the few who hold the power and resources (\"there are rich teams, there are poor teams... there's fifty feet of shit, then there's us\"). The game is rigged in their favor.  But...capitalism also forces innovation, Billy's place at the bottom forced him to innovate. And in the end, it got baseball closer to a meritocracy, where individuals are accurately compensated for the value they create. For better or for worse, that is America. \n\n**3. The acting, directing and writing are all remarkable**. Bennett Miller came from a documentary background, so he captured the film in a way that felt like a documentary, using real footage in key moments and recreating it in others. But Aaron Sorkin's dialogue adds a pace and flavor that it unbeatable. And then of course, Pitt and Hill are remarkable. Excellent casting. Not to mention Phillip Seymour Hoffman. \n\n**4. Above all else, I believe this movie is about Leadership**. This is the most important one IMO. I don't think anyone watching the movie will realize it until they obsess over it like I did. But really this movie is about Billy Beane's leadership. Humans are addicted to effective leaders. Beane was faced with great adversity, he accurately identified the threat, came up with a solution and found a way to implement his vision, despite great resistance. He also lifted up those around him who believed in his vision, even though they were young and inexperienced. That is what great leaders do. And subconsciously, I think that is the real, strongest draw of the film. And it certainly helps that Pitt is the perfect casting for it. ",

The only bright spot was ***Clown in a Cornfield***, while ***Shadow Force*** and ***Fight or Flight*** had some of the worst debuts for films playing at over 2,000 theaters.

That drop is better than ***Captain America: Brave New World*** (68.3%) earlier this year, but it feels like the film could've done a bit better than this.

Not to mention its new title change, [which was heavily promoted on social media.](https://variety.com/2025/film/news/thunderbolts-poster-the-new-avengers-title-change-1236386731/) But it looks like its \"A\u2013\" on CinemaScore pretty much signaled that while word of mouth is good, it's not exceptional enough to convince those skeptical.\n\nThrough 10 days, the film has earned $127.7 million domestically. While the film is posting better daillies than ***Brave New World***, it's still $14 million behind that film through the same point. That film benefitted from lack of competition and a lot of under-performers. ***Thunderbolts***, on the other hand, is about to face more challenges. This weekend, it's losing PLF screens to ***Final Destination: Bloodlines***, which should dethrone it. And then it's gonna face a brutal Memorial Day Weekend with the arrival of ***Lilo &amp; Stitch* and *Mission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning***. What a contrast: a poorly received film with weak competition vs. a well received film with a lot of competition. Right now, it doesn't look like ***Thunderbolts*** will hit $200 million lifetime, which is quite concerning.\n\n***Sinners*** had its biggest drop this weekend. But when your biggest drop means just 33%, you know you're absolutely killing it. The film earned another $22.1 million this weekend, managing to add even more theaters on its fourth weekend. The film has earned an incredible $215.4 million, passing ***Captain America: Brave New World*** as the second biggest film of the year domestically. Depending on how it drops next weekend against ***Final Destination: Bloodlines***, we could be looking at a $270 million domestic total. And it can go higher!\n\n***A Minecraft Movie*** is still on the top 3. It dropped 44%, earning $7.6 million this weekend. The film has earned $408.6 million so far, and it's set to finish with a little below $430 million domestically.\n\nIn fourth place, ***The Accountant 2*** recovered from its rough drop. It eased just 29%, adding $6.7 million this weekend. The film has earned $51.5 million so far, and it should make a nice amount of money before facing brutal competition from ***Mission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning***.\n\n***Clown in a Cornfield*** debuted in fifth place, earning $3.6 million in 2,277 theaters. That's the best debut for Shudder/IFC, and they wisely spent very little on marketing (not even $10 million here). Although with a \"C+\" on CinemaScore and rough competition from ***Final Destination: Bloodlines*** next weekend might prevent it from hitting $10 million.\n\nLionsgate released ***Shadow Force*** in 2,170 theaters, but the film flopped with an abysmal $2.1 million this weekend. Considering the move was very last-minute, it's no surprise that the audience just didn't care for this. They gave it a middling \"B\" on CinemaScore, and with heavy competition on the coming weeks, it's unlikely it will stay long enough to hit $5 million domestically.\n\nVertical also released ***Fight or Flight*** on 2,153 theaters, but it flopped with just $2 million this weekend. Well, we can't really act surprised; this company hasn't been very successful in launching films on wide release. With a \"C+\" on CinemaScore, this is going to disappear quickly from theaters.\n\nIn eighth place, Sony's ***Until Dawn*** dropped 49% this weekend, adding $1.9 million this weekend. The film has earned just $17.9 million, and with ***Final Destination: Bloodlines*** coming up, it won't make it much further than $20 million domestically.\n\n20th Century Studios' ***The Amateur*** dropped a light 39%, earning $1.1 million. The film has amassed $39 million so far.\n\nRounding up the Top 10 was Angel Studios' ***The King of Kings***. It continued falling, now dropping 54% and adding $778,391 this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $59.1 million so far.\n\nOkay, it was a lot of negativity this weekend, so let's go to the other bright spot of the weekend. A24's ***Friendship***, starring Tim Robinson and Paul Rudd, earned $451,904 in 6 theaters. That's an incredible $75,317 per-theater average, which is the best of the year so far.\n\nOf course, a fantastic performance in limited release does not guarantee a successful wide expansion (***Kinds of Kindness*** comes to mind). But who knows? Maybe Tim Robinson's fanbase could be bigger than expected.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\nIf ***Thunderbolts*** is not lighting the domestic box office on fire, the overseas prospects are also looking quite bad.\n\nOn its second weekend, the film added $34 million overseas this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $271.4 million. That's a rough 60% drop from last weekend (even if we exclude the weekday holidays from last week, it's still a 52% drop), which is steeper than expected, and barely above ***Brave New World***'s second weekend ($35 million). The best markets are the UK ($15.5M), China ($13.8M), Mexico ($11.2M), France ($7.2M) and Australia ($6.4M). With drops like these and heavy competition on its way, there's a strong chance the film could miss $400 million. Considering the $180 million budget, that's flop territory. Damn, what does this mean for the MCU? \n\n***A Minecraft Movie*** added $12.5 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $909 million. The best markets are the UK ($71.2M), Germany ($37M), Australia ($34.2M), Mexico ($32M) and China ($28.4M). The billion milestone is starting to feel unlikely.\n\n***Sinners*** added $6.6 million this weekend. Its worldwide total is now $283 million, and should hit $300 million by Friday. The best markets are the UK ($17.4M), France ($8.1M), Australia ($5.5M), Mexico ($3.9M) and Germany ($3.1M).\n\n3 weeks ahead of its domestic debut, ***Karate Kid: Legends*** premiered in 12 markets in Latin America, debuting with $5.7 million. The best market was Mexico with $3 million, although this debut is lower than the 2010 version ($3.5 million). Other markets are Brazil ($860K), Peru ($415K) and Argentina ($320K). It won't hit more markets till the last weekend of May.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nNone.\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nWe've got two wide releases, with one clear winner.\n\n***Final Destination: Bloodlines*** should easily win the top spot. It's the sixth installment in the iconic franchise, and follows a group who realizes Death is coming after them... because they should never have existed in the first place. Notably, it includes Tony Todd's final appearance in the franchise, having filmed all his scenes prior to his death in November 2024. This is one of the most iconic horror franchises of the century, with the past 5 films earning a combined $666 million worldwide (hey, that's cool). It's gonna have a pretty great opening. The question is how high can it go?\n\nAnother release is Trey Edward Schults' ***Hurry Up Tomorrow***, which is a companion piece to The Weeknd's album of the same name. It stars The Weeknd, Jenna Ortega, and Barry Keoghan, and follows a fictionalized version of the Weeknd, an insomniac musician on the verge of a mental breakdown who is pulled into an existential odyssey by a mysterious stranger. The Weeknd drew poor reviews for his performance in ***The Idol***, but at least he's working with a great filmmaker like Trey Edward Shults here. Although the film is probably going to be sold for Weeknd fans, and Weeknd fans only. Will the general audience care?\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

        "content": "Out of boredom I looked up the average movie ticket prices for the past 40 years (the duration of my lifetime.) \n\n1985 - $3.55  \n1995 - $4.35 (+22.54%)  \n2005 - $6.55 (+50.57%)  \n2015 - $8.65 (+32.06%)  \n2025 - $16.08 (+85.95%)\n\nThis past decade has given us the largest price increase in tickets for the past 40 years. From 1985 to 2015 movie ticket prices increased by $5.01, yet from 2015 to 2025 prices increase by roughly $7.43. \n\nThe average might be $16.08, but my local theaters are $18-$20 a ticket. I rarely go to the theater anymore because I\u2019ve been priced out of it. I paid $10 to see Endgame in the same theater I just paid over $18 to see Thunderbolts. \n\nI can\u2019t help but wonder if theaters lowered the average movie ticket prices to $10-$12 a ticket if it would make it more accessible to more people. And if these lower prices would be profitable. \n\nWe saw a constant stream of billion dollar films when tickets were $10(ish) but now it seems like movies struggle more than ever. I know I can\u2019t support theaters like I did, I just can\u2019t afford it anymore. ",
