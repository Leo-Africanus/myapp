        "title": "Eric Stoltz made me understand the tragedy of the ending of Back to the Future and the inhumanity of the American Dream.",
        "content": "I think a good part of here knows the story behind the first casting of the protagonist of \"Back to the Future\". Michael J. Fox was not available and Eric Stoltz was chosen. But his type of acting was not suitable for what was a comedy, he was fired and MJF who had become available was called. The rest is history.\n\nBut recently I saw an interview with Lea Thompson (who plays Marty McFly's mother, Lorraine Baines).\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-\\_lWQhgLYA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-_lWQhgLYA)\n\nHere she tells an interesting anecdote. After the first reading of the script with the actors they are all enthusiastic, the story is great everyone laughs etc etc. Then they ask Eric what he thinks and he says it is a tragedy. Because at the end of the film Marty remembers a past and a family that no longer exists. His new family are strangers who have lived a totally different life. And this new family has lost a son, because at home they have a stranger who coincidentally has the same name.\n\nAnd I add, the movie tells us that all this is perfectly okay why? Because now Marty has a nicer house, he has a new car, he has so many *things*. Marty has lost his whole life but in exchange he has so many new material goods. And this is the essence of the American Dream, as long as you have things (goods, money, power, fame), everything else (love, family, beliefs) can be sacrificed.\n\n(I think that even Crispin Glover - who played Marty's dad, was very critical about the movie message: money and financial success = happiness)",

        "content": "There's some comedies from my childhood and teens that I watch now that I still have nostalgia for, but I look at them and I go yeah this is dated or this isn't as funny as I remember. I had that feeling a few years ago with American Pie where I watched it again and it really started to feel dated which is alarming for me because it seems like yesterday I was watching that movie as a kid on HBO behind my parents back. Superbad to me from start to finish is as perfect of a comedy as you're going to get. A very funny, relatable script from Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. Really cool locations and sets by Greg mottle and all the characters are so perfectly cast and portrayed. Not one missed joke in the entire movie and it's genuinely a movie that even at 32 I still laugh at damn near every frame now as I did at 14 when I saw it in theaters. ",

I loved the dichotomy between the Sheriff and Foster, where they both reach a breaking point with bullshit and go past the point of no return.\n\nAlmost all of the points are still relevant today.  The overpriced goods, the screwed up politics and bureaucracies, liars prospering, Nazis, people getting rich off useless and empty services, wasting land and wealth on the few while the majority are suffering.  \n\nWhat a great goddamn movie.",

Vudu/Fandango also carries a few fun things for free (though the app sadly isn't available on PS4 anymore), and Pluto TV tends to have a solid selection as well.\n\nAs an example of the quality work that Tubi is frequently showing off these days, they've currently got Heat, Train To Busan, Taxi Driver, Point Break, and Dances With Wolves all sitting pretty in their selection.. and that's just the very tip of the iceberg when it comes to the interesting things in their archives, much of it hidden away underneath the large pile of trashy stuff that they also tend to have lying around.\n\nBlockbusters, indie gems, gritty action classics, forgotten oddball work; the variety that you can find on a lot of these services is just awesome. So if there's any other film fans out there who ever struggle to find something interesting to watch, I just wanted to say: take a scroll through the archives of these services, and I think you'll find at least a few things that catch your eye.",

        "content": "For one example, there's a lot of reasons to dislike the \"Twilight\" films (as well as the books), but what I find especially annoying is that not only does it focus on the least interesting characters of the story, but Stephanie Meyer also created all of these side characters with backstories that sound like they'd make much better movies. In particular, there's the scene in \"Eclipse\" where Nikki Reed's Rosalie describes her backstory; she was gang-raped by her fianc\u00e9e and his cronies and left for dead, was turned into a vampire to save her and then proceeded to go on a spree of vengeance against her attackers, leaving her fianc\u00e9e for last. Frankly, a vampire mix of \"I Spit on Your Grave\" and \"Kill Bill\" sounds a lot more interesting to watch than anything around Bella, Edward or Jacob.\n\nYour example?",

        "content": "First off, what an incredibly beautiful and stylish film. The cinematography, heavy saturation and overuse (in a good way) of split diopter shots really pull you into this one. \n\nThe script uses one of my favorite writing techniques, which is to show you glimpses of the wider story &gt;!like the opposing politicians who ordered the expose on McRyan, Burke's meetings with them (the very concept of a meeting with a pro-assassin is hilarious), Jack's backstory with the cops, how the death is impacting the presidential race, Manny &amp; Sally's schemes and so on!&lt;, but never letting you get distracted from the fact that *this* is the main storyline. It makes the world of the movie feel so real.\n\nAlso, and I said this in the past about Serpico (1973), I love how grimy and \"un-movie-like\" the setting is. Manny's apartment, the train station, the streets, everything is very much as-is. \n\nJohn Lithgow with a performance for the ages, probably my new favorite movie sociopath. He's far from the cartoony portrayals you normally see, with the silly \"dropping the smile when the victim isn't looking\", he is just always *on*. \n\nAs soon as the movie ended, all I could think of was that I will definitely watch it again.",

        "content": "I noticed there are some movies like Argo and Jojo Rabbit where they are nominated at the Oscars for what I'd argue to be the most important categories when it comes to the quality of a film: best picture, best screenplay, and best editing. But how could a film be nominated for all 3 of these categories but not be nominated for best director? Wouldn't the director be the one of the main driving forces behind how all of these categories come together to create for a coherent film? I don't want to discredit the other categories like sound, score, production design, etc. But my brain simply cannot process how something like this can happen. Can anyone explain this to me?",
