        "title": "Introducing the Fantasy Box Office Game: Two years ago I met a redditor who was running a Fantasy Box Office League game from an Excel spreadsheet and now it\u2019s a fully functional website. Get ready for the 2026 Box Office year with us!",
        "content": "# [fantasyboxofficegame.com](http://fantasyboxofficegame.com)\n\n\n\nJust want to start off by stating that this is not a paid ad and this website is totally free to use.\n\n\n\nTwo years ago I was looking for a way to get more nerdy about movies. I love fantasy football and had heard of some similar games centered around the box office, so I did some googling and found a post on reddit from u/Chris_Tennant saying that he had made a game that runs off of Google Sheets. I messaged him and we ended up chatting on discord and he said it was a work in progress but he was looking for people to play it and give feedback. So I put a couple leagues together, two leagues with my coworkers and one with some other r/movies mods, and long story short we had an absolute blast with it.\u00a0\n\n\n\nChris has been working on this thing like crazy since then and this last year he upgraded it from a Google Sheet to a \\[website\\](fantasyboxofficegame.com). It looks great and is really intuitive. This year I\u2019m running four leagues and it\u2019s been a wild year for the BO and anyone who follows the news will tell you it\u2019s only going to get more unpredictable. Here\u2019s how the game works.   \n  \n\n\n**The game consists of three drafts throughout the year, one every four months, in which you draft movies only for the coming four months. Jan-Apr, May-Aug, Sep-Dec.**\n\n\n\n**When you select a movie you take on the burden of 2.5x that movie\u2019s budget upon release.**\n\n\n\n**So if you pick a movie with a budget of 100mil, you get negative 250mil when that movie comes out and then gain the box office for its entire theater run as it happens.**\u00a0\n\n\n\n**There are essentially three different kinds of draft picks.**\n\n* **The Hit Pick. One movie chosen from the entire calendar year that you are betting on to make all the money. You only get one of these per year. You will probably want a major blockbuster.**\u00a0\n* **Seasonal Picks. 3-4 of these per draft, so 9-12 total. This will make up the bulk of your roster. You can adjust how many depending on how many people are in your league or whatever rules you want.**\u00a0\n* **The Bomb Pick. This is a pick that you think will** ***lose*** **a lot of money, and it goes to all of your opponents rosters instead of yours. You only get one of these per year and they are chosen during the first draft, much like the Hit Pick.**\u00a0\n\n  \nAs the movies on your roster release, you take on their negative budget and watch it slowly climb back up as it continues to make money. Here\u2019s what our current season looks like:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ytyge9jcol6g1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be324efdcbc56169cc020cb951cb4c1bbe09c8b5\n\n\n\nEach of those datapoints is clickable to see what movie release it is and you can see the numerical stats here (please do not roast me for picking Snow White, no Disney Live Action Remake had lost money before this):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f60anpkdol6g1.png?width=1045&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6592e4adcef2789259f7305b5371fa5028095a16\n\nWe have been playing this for two years now and the drafts are always so fun and unpredictable and there\u2019s a surprising amount of strategy to it. You don\u2019t always know budgets this far in advance so you have to gamble a bit on which studios are more conservative with their budgets and realistically how expensive movies look.   \n  \nSo get some friends together or organize a league here in the comments with other redditors. **It\u2019s totally free** and if you\u2019re a movie nerd like me then I can vouch that this really adds a lot of fun and investment to every release!",

        "content": "Re-watching the scene with Aurelio and Tarasov: the first few times I watched these scenes I was thinking of it as Aurelio owing John respect, and being disgusted by Tarasov's behavior. But re-watching it now, I realize that Aurelio is absolutely *terrified*. He realizes that if John thinks for a moment that he's helped Tarasov that he's dead, whereas if he humiliates Tarsov and kicks him out at least he has a chance of surviving Viggo's wrath. Both the scenes with Tarasov and the scenes with John he's basically making the case for his life, just in different ways.\n\nIt's easy to miss because John doesn't show any overt hostility towards Aurelio but part of Reeves' performance is he doesn't often show that, and the (apparently) calm drinking scene where Aurelio pours John a drink and they have the brief conversation about Tarasov is still one fraught with tension.\n\nAurelio's anxiousness is most evident when Tarasov first shows up with the car. It's not just Aurelio being disdainful of Tarasov, he's acutely aware that now he's involved, and knows that John's going to show up at some point. And if John thinks Aurelio helped Tarasov that he's a dead man. It's honestly a fantastic performance from Leguizamo, an all time great character actor, demonstrating a mix of emotions that I think often gets overlooked. It's honestly kind of amusing that he's demonstrating less fear during the conversation with Viggo (although not none) than he is when he's talking to Tarasov.",

        "content": "This movie is absolutely excellent in my opinion; I think it\u2019s one of Peter Jackson\u2019s best films, right alongside The Lord of the Rings. It\u2019s perfect in pretty much every way. I love the directing, the acting, the actors, the score, and the locations. The CGI for the time looked phenomenal back in 2005 and still holds up incredibly well today. I know that the film\u2019s length was and still is controversial, but I actually don\u2019t mind it. I personally think that the buildup to Skull Island is well done, and I think the whole movie was paced fairly well overall - with the first hour being in New York City and on the ship, the second hour on the island, and the third and final hour back in New York with Kong causing chaos. What do you all think? I think this is still the best version of Kong; I wish the newer movies had kept the 2005 design.\n\nEdit - this is in no way a diss to any of the other films; I like King Kong no matter what, and they're all good in their own ways. I just personally find this one, in my opinion, to be the best. I love having discussions like this and seeing the discussions; it's super awesome to be able to talk about these things with people who are just as passionate about movies as I am. The overall consensus does appear to be that I'm right about this, though.",

        "content": "What are your thoughts on BlackBerry\n\nI saw BlackBerry just recently and I must say, I really did enjoy the film. Essentially the film is about the BlackBerry line of mobile phones and how it achieved success and failed and stars Jay Baruchel as Mike Lazardiis, Glenn Howerton as Jim Ballsillie, and Matt Johnson as Doug Fregin, who also directed the film.\n\nSo with the film, I thought it was well-written, great set designs, and was very fun to watch and the performances were good.\n\nI must say, I was really shocked at how good the performances were and I felt Glenn Howerton stole the show as Jim Balsillie, who basically came in and whipped Mike &amp; Doug into shape and make sure that the Company didn't go bust the moment he came in. I was impressed &amp; surprised with Jay Baruchel in the role of Mike, who while not as cutthroat as Jim, has enough knowledge in tech and knows what is behind it to actually get inventors interested in it &amp; in the end, grows somewhat of a spine. Matt Johnson was also good as Doug. I must say, I felt was an idiot for most of the film. He is great with the tech side of things, but on the business side of things, he is very clueless and I felt he really didn\u2019t understand the stakes that were involved. (which I find funny as in real life, his character was at least aware enough to sell his stock and become one of the richest men in the world). Also to mentioned, Michael Ironside was great in the small role he had and stole the scenes he was in.\n\nOverall, the film was just an enjoyable experience and probably one of the better of a Social Network rip-offs.",
