        "title": "Best and worst examples of exposition in movies?",
        "content": "Screenwriters of course have to convey information to the audience in one form or another, and the canonical maxim is \"show, don't tell.\"  Not every writer adheres to that rule, though, and we're all familiar with some of the lazy tricks writers use to dump info on the audience (expository newscasts, for example).\n\nFor a good example of exposition in screenwriting, I'd offer up *Apollo 13*.  The exposition and background info is given in relatively small doses most of the time, such as in snippets of dialogue between people at Mission Control, and some info is conveyed during a chat that Lovell has with his young son, which comes across very natural, and exactly the way you'd talk to a boy that age, with the side benefit that the audience learns something, too.\n\nFor a poor example of exposition in screenwriting, I'd offer up *Avatar*, specifically the scene where Selfridge info dumps to Dr. Augustine about unobtanium being a highly sought-after resource, and the reason why humans have a presence on Pandora, and how they're on the brink of war with the Na'vi, and so forth.  She listens to all of this as if it's perfectly natural that he's explaining things *that she already knows because she's been working there for years*.  It is just a very ham-fisted way of conveying the current state of affairs on Pandora to the audience, and comes across as incredibly forced and unnatural.  \n\nAnd the thing is, Jake Sully was the newbie on the scene, so it would have made much more sense for Selfridge to have that talk with *him*, rather than with Augustine.  (I know this movie is not highly-regarded in some circles, and it was never considered a masterclass in writing, but I actually liked it, for the most part.  I'm just quibbling with one particular aspect of the script here.)",
