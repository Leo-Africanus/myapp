After Siskel passed, it was still must see viewing to see Ebert's reviews (No knock against Roeper; the show's essence didn't change; which is a testament to him.)\n\n\n\nI agreed with Ebert about 90% of the time (overall thumbs up/down), but what mattered most was hearing his reasoning, which when combined with my preferences, it created a super quick heuristic to know whether I would love, like, dislike or hate a movie. For example, his review of Blue Velvet, which he disliked, gave me enough information to want to see it.  \n  \nSince his passing, there has been a void in me and surely others. Changes in cultural and technology are the main culprits, and I don't know of a good solution (for society as a whole).\n\n\n\n/mild rant over",

        "content": "I live in a tier 3 city in india. We have 5 theatres here and they play international movies often but only like the really mainstream high budget movies so most movies which I wanna watch don't even release. Just this month, Weapons, Together and sorry baby came out and none of them released here. It's extremely disheartening. Also most movies only stay in English for a week since the audience for them is so less. Most people watch it dubbed here\n\nThankfully through digital, most movies are available much earlier than before. I can already watch both Sorry baby and eddington without waiting too long and can do a 3rd viewing of Superman.\n\nSo yeah, before complaining about a movie coming to digital early, think about other people too",

Why are women almost always making the worst decisions  in all these movies??\n\nThis scene creeped me out most of all because as someone who\u2019s been in NYC their entire life I\u2019ve always found late night empty train stations kinda creepy, especially when the streets feel empty too. It always feels like someone is watching you or following you. \n\nIt\u2019s a film set in NYC but it\u2019s an Italian production. I love when foreign films are set in the states. They\u2019re always so bizarre. But it\u2019s interesting to see what foreign studios do with their films set in the states. I imagine it is how foreign countries view Hollywood productions set in their countries. \n\nThe actor they cast to play the murderer was genuinely creepy. ",

        "content": "I am going by the movies. I read the sequel book 2010: Odyssey 2 about 45 years ago, and don't have it off-hand.\n\nIn the sequel movie 2010: The Year We Make Contact, there is an important scene in which Chandra (HAL's creator) informs Dr. Floyd that he has figured out exactly why HAL malfunctioned in the first movie and went on a killing-spree.  The following is from the scene in which Chandra is telling Dr. Floyd (the space agency director in the first movie) and Curnow (the chief engineer of the Discovery) about this:\n\n&gt;(Chandra to Floyd) In going through HAL's memory banks I discovered his original orders. You wrote those orders.\n\n&gt;Discovery's mission to Jupiter was already in the advanced stages when the first small monolith was found and sent its signal toward Jupiter. By direct presidential order, the existence of that monolith was kept secret. So as the function of the command crew Bowman and Poole was to get Discovery to its destination it was decided they shouldn't be informed. The investigative team was trained separately and placed in hibernation before the voyage began. Since HAL was capable of operating Discovery without human assistance it was decided he should be programmed to complete the mission autonomously in the event the crew was incapacitated or killed.He was given full knowledge of the true objective and instructed not to reveal anything to Bowman or Poole.\n\n&gt;He was instructed to lie.\n\n&gt;(Floyd) What are you talking about? I didn't authorize anyone to tell HAL about the monolith.\n\n&gt;(Chandra) The directive is NSC 342-slash-23 Top Secret, January 30, 2001.\n\n&gt;(Curnow) NSC, National Security Council, the White House.\n\n&gt;(Chandra) I don't care who it is. The situation was in conflict with the basic purpose of HAL's design, the accurate processing of information without distortion or concealment.\n\n&gt;He became trapped.\n\n&gt;The technical term is an H-Mobius loop, which can happen in advanced computers with autonomous goal-seeking programs.\n\n&gt;(Curnow) The goddamn White House.\n\n&gt;(Floyd) I don't believe it.\n\n&gt;(Chandra) HAL was told to lie, by people who find it easy to lie. HAL doesn't know how, so he couldn't function. He became paranoid.\n\n&gt;(Floyd) I didn't know. I didn't know.\n\n I was watching the original movie 2001 recently, and at the end right after Bowman disconnects HAL, this triggers the playback of a video the was apparently supposed to be played to the Bowman and Poole after they got to Jupiter. The video is by Floyd (played in the first movie by a different actor) instructing them about the real purposes of the mission, and begins with this:\n\n&gt;This is a prerecorded briefing, made prior to your departure, and which for security reasons of the highest importance has been known on board during the mission, only by your HAL-9000 computer.\n\nSo was Floyd lying in 2010 when he said he did not authorize anyone to tell HAL about the monolith? The video that Bowman triggered in the first movie says that he did.\n\n  \n\n\n",
