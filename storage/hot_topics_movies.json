Since most people there knew the movie by heart, they just started doing the dialogue out loud. It was hilarious.

        "content": "I used to do SFX and my first job out of university was a shock to me because I realized motorbikes and gunshots on screen didn't sound like actual motorbikes or gunshots. I suddenly realized the studio's collection of 100 000 sound effects was useless without the experience to know which 50 effects the audience had been conditioned to accept as authentic by other films. And then there as the foleying that I helped with, in which a man kneeing a watermelon doesn't sound like a Hollywood effect, a real punch to the face doesn't sound like a Hollywood effect, but a man kneeing a watermelon with olive oil on his leg sounded \"right\" for reasons I can't explain.\n\nSomething I appreciate in the filming of movies is when the actors are actually shouting in loud environments (nightclubs, windstorms) because they're recorded in silence and the music/wind is added later. What this usually results in is the audio being loud to establish it's loud, then the SFX editor has to radically drop the levels because the actors have been recorded talking in their normal voices. I appreciate it when the director gives them directions to act like they're in a loud place. I was on a set once where the director had the actors put earplugs in so they HAD to yell (everyone in the scene had long hair or were given weird hats to hide the ear plugs).\n\nAnyways, I'm watching Bullet Train Explosion right now and they just used the Wilhelm scream for a student getting punched. I had to burst out laughing because, well, it sounds right when someone falls off a cliff, not when someone falls over a train seat.\n\n\n\n",

It's not that it's a bad film, it just was not what I expected. \n\nSequels:\n\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1 was such a bummer after a franchise high with Fallout.\n\nThe Accountant 2 - buddy film molded into the world of \"The Accountant\". It didn't embrace what made the first one a sleeper hit.  \n\nJoker: Folie a Deux - amazing visuals in incredible promotional materials but such a slog. ",

        "content": "This is just a spoiler free recommendation\n\nFirst and foremost, I don't like Kpop. Don't really listen to it. Not a pop person in general. Just listen to a few hits here or there, I'm saying this to highlight I'm not the targeted demographic for this flick. But despite that the premise of this movie, popstars Vs. Demons seemed really intresting to me. So I went in with doubts and walked out with my mind blown. This was one of the best things that came out this year and as far as animation goes, one of the best animated things I've seen in a long while.\n\nThat biggest thing that has floored me about this movie is just the sheer amount of outfits the characters change into. They fucking went HAM on their character designs. The animation quality and the exquisite taste of this movie are top notch. Smooth Sakuga action scenes at every corner.\n\nI can't praise this movie enough. It's perfect from every angle. It's bursting with Korean culture and It's fucking hilarious, the comedy is spot on. It's taking aspects from K-movies, dramas, music, fashion. Everthing. The story is also fucking amazing when it hits it's emotional peaks.\n\nThe biggest compliment I can give this movie is that it's like capturing those imaginary music videos we make in our heads when listening to music and animating it into an hour and a half montage.\n\nThe songs in this movie have potential to be \"Let It Go\" annoying with the overuse. Because they're catchy af.\n\nI didn't know how bad I was aching for a good ~~chick flick~~ (**EDIT**: ***Not*** a chick flick, my bad. I misinterpreted the term. I meant girl power action movie) until this satisfied that desire spontaneously. It brought back a sense of nostalgia for me of watching Totally Spies for some reason. It's the superhero/ teenager work, life balance vibes that they share.",

        "title": "I think I finally understand No Country for Old Men for myself",
        "content": "I've always loved this movie since I first saw it in theaters, but I think I've always struggled to connect with it thematically. Obviously the movie is subject to a wide variety of interpretation, but I saw it again last night and there were a couple of scenes that stood out to me this time:\n\n1. The conversation Sheriff Ed Bell has with his brother. His brother brings up the point about having humility and warns Ed not to believe the world *works differently for you*.\n\n2. The scene where Carson Welles meets Lleweyln Moss in the hospital in Mexico. Carson is talking about Chigurh, and Llewelyn makes the comments \"Who is this guy? The ultimate badass?\" in kind of an annoyed tone of voice.\n\nThe three main protagonists of the movie, Llewelyn, Ed Bell, and Chigurh, all share the same flaw to varying degrees--they all share in a degree of personal exceptionalism:\n\n1. Ed Bell believes at some level that he's on a noble path, and like he tells his brother, he felt like his choices would be validated in the end by \"God suddenly coming into my life\"--feeling like his life would culminate in some spiritual satisfaction and was therefore meant to be. He has become disillusioned by the lack of this feeling--a lack of success or victory as a lawman (as he sees it), with the criminals getting away with heinous, senseless violence. He can't even find closure in his personal life--the dream he describes to his wife in the end symbolizes that: it doesn't have a happy, meaningful ending--it just ends.\n\n2. Llewlyn thinks *he* is the ultimate badass and that he's smart/tough enough to overcome any adversary, even if it's the full brunt of the drug cartel. He tries to act like he's Rambo by putting all of his Vietnam combat experience into staging his escape/cat-and-mouse hunt with Chigurh, and his ego won't let him give up the fight. Carla Jean is enamored by this quality when she tries to tell Ed Bell that Llewelyn can take on all comers. In actuality, we see, as Carson points out, that he's a loser who can't make ends meet and is really not that difficult to predict. The movie devotes a fair number of scenes to him \"prepping\" for the fight by buying various things from sporting goods stores, and as a moviegoer you expect some kind of Rambo/A-Team/MacGyver-esque ingenuity from that, but it doesn't really amount to much. His skills and instincts keep him alive for a while, but he never really turns the tables and is vastly outnumbered by the cartel, which has no dearth of hitmen after him.\n\n3. Chigurh, of course, is delusional and insane and believes he is some sort of supernatural force of fate.\n\nAll three guys commit the sin of vanity in their own ways, and Reality ensues for them all, but the only one to cash his chips in and move on with life is Bell. He is humbled by the carnage and literally escapes with his life after he decides to give up his pursuit (with Chigurh right there!). That's the movie for me--it's an all-time great movie that still has me thinking about it nearly twenty years later.",

So on that note, did anyone else absolutely love Annihilation? I saw it 4 times in the theater. I like Alex Garlands work ",

Not too mention, it ends with the kid literally creating himself a better living by helping his parents when they were younger. Also, Michael J Fox and Christopher Loyd are great as always.\n\nIts not just one of the best films ever made, buts its Robert Zemekis's best film in general. Yeah, I said it.\n\nEasy 10/10.",

        "content": "When people talk about movies they only would watch once, it's almost exclusively sad movies. Requiem for a Dream, 12 Years a Slave, Grave of the Fireflies, Dear Zachary - all these movies are really well made and people give them their flowers, but like no shit people only want to watch them once, they're emotionally devastating. \n  \nMeanwhile I think of Nomadland. Other than the main character's background of losing her things in a recession, the story isn't supposed to be sad. I mean, it's about a woman finding out what makes her happy and brings her joy and peace. And she finds a community of like-minded people. But man, it just instilled such an incredible sense of loneliness in me unlike anything else I've seen. And it came out right after the worst bout of depression I've ever had in my life, so I hate it because I felt like it found joy specifically where I had found misery.\n \nAnd this post was also inspired by how much I hated the new How to Train Your Dragon, which was also, technically, in theory, \"well made,\" but I hated because of its sheer and (other than 1998's Psycho) unprecedented lack of creativity, but unlike with Psycho which arguably made for an interesting artistic experiment, HTTYD was made exclusively for the sake of money and commercialism. Idc if money is the driving force behind your movie getting made, I just care that you're going to make something original\n  \nSo, other non-sad movies that you hate with a passion?",
