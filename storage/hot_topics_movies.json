        "title": "Jojo Rabbit, a comedy about a 10 year old Nazi.",
        "content": "Jojo Rabbit\n\nA comedy about a ten year old boy who loves being a Nazi. That shouldn\u2019t work. When I first saw Jojo Rabbit, I didn\u2019t know much about it. All I saw was a quick summary along the lines of, \u201cA boy in Nazi Germany towards the end of WWII discovers that his mother has been helping a young Jewish girl hide out in their attic.\u201d I thought I was about to watch a serious drama, but then it kicks off with a little boy and his imaginary friend, Hitler, and their banter. \u201cI guess it\u2019s a comedy,\u201d I told myself.\n\n\n\nThis movie is very funny. Sam Rockwell and Rebel Wilson at the youth camp are hilarious. Not only is the writing witty, the physical comedy hits the right notes of goofy. My favorite side character is Yorki. He gets to have the best lines:\n\n* \u201cI\u2019m going home to my mom. I need a snuggle.\u201d\n* \u201cGuess I\u2019m just a kid trapped in a fat kid\u2019s body.\u201d\n* \u201cSomehow I just keep staying alive.\u201d\n* \"The Japanese are our only allies left, and between you and me, they don't really look that Aryan.\"\n\n\n\nWhat the movie does with tone throughout the runtime is what I believe makes it a great film. The first time we see Jojo looking upon people hanging in the square, and is told that what they did is what they could, this hilarious comedy lets us know that the reality of the situation is extremely bleak. We also find out that Jojo\u2019s father is in the war, and that his mother is having the hardest time raising a young boy who has been brainwashed by the Nazis\u2019 propaganda. When Johansson pretends that she is her husband, it really makes me feel bad that she is alone in trying to raise a boy amidst the war, a war that she hates and knows how her country is in the wrong.\n\n\n\nThe \u201cshoes scene\u201d, as I like to call it, may be the largest gut punch any comedy has ever put to screen. We just had seen the most tense scene, where we think that Elsa has been found out by the Gestapo, but then gets away. There is a butterfly and nice music, and it feels like maybe everything is going to be alright. But then we see the shoes. Again, how a comedy can turn the mood so fast is where this movie earns its greatness.\n\n\n\nThe dilemma Jojo finds himself in, where he wants to be a good Nazi and turn in the hiding Jewish girl, but he knows if he does so, he, and especially his mother, would be in trouble, is quite unique. If Jojo wasn\u2019t ten years old, I don\u2019t think this plot would work. How can we have any feelings for someone who loves Hitler? It makes me feel bad for any youth who are raised to hate others.\n\n\n\nSo how did Taika make a movie about Nazis funny? He made sure to let the audience know that Nazis are stupid. It has a repeating gag of Hitler offering him a cigarette. If you watch this movie and get nothing out of it, at least you will know, Nazis are stupid.\n\n",

This is the movie that made me understand what love is, the chemistry between Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen is incredible, you genuinely believe their bond, but at the same time, it's such a sad movie. \n\nWhat might seem a movie about an Alien. Starman/Scott (Jeff Bridges), taking human form and holding his female companion, Jenny (Allen)  hostage for most of the film, ends up being a picture about an alien life form learning how it is to be a human while at the same time, a broken woman starts to accept the loss of her husband/partner, the alien having taken his appearance which adds greater gravitas. Jenny barely having survived the death of Scott, now faces another loss, Starman/Scott whom she learns to love and starts to yearn to leave Earth with him. All the time, they're being chased after by the Government. \n\nCrucial for the movie, it's Jack Nitzsche's epic, bittersweet and operatic score. Every time that score came up, I got goosebumps. It's so good. \n\nI don't think Starman gets as much attention as it deserves. It's such a classic but not many people know about it. Even with Jeff Bridges getting a nom (Karen Allen deserved a nom too).",

        "title": "Threads - A review of Britain's darkest and bleakest film",
        "content": "I was always fascinated by the effects of a nuclear war in Britain. I looked at old documentaries and informational films such as Protect and Survive when I was younger. I thought about how to protect myself and my family should the worse happen. I was thinking to myself that \"We could survive this with proper planning.\" \n\nI'm not correct. The mortality rate of a nuclear war in the UK was estimated at 53% of the UK population, some 29 million people, according to Square Leg. Chances are, I wouldn't even be safe. I used to live near RAF Menwith Hill, a missile warning site, and one of the primary targets for a first strike. But I still believed that I would be one of the \"lucky ones\" and would survive the nuclear explosions and fallout. \n\nLast night, I watched the film Threads from 1984, which seriously made me reconsider my position.\n\nThe film is split into three acts: the time before the bombs, the short period of civilisation months after the attack, and the following years of the attack. No matter where you skip to in the film, misery and fear is a constant theme.\n\n\"Threads\" is a film that slaps you in the face with the horrifying truth of the reality that a nuclear war would be the end of civilisation as we know it. It is cold in its message, delivery and story. It doesn't exist to tell a story, to give emotional beats that make you want to tear up or to make you laugh. It exists for only one message: nuclear war would be devastating.\n\nThis film was broadcast on TV in the 1980s. Then the BBC unofficially banned it, and I can see why. This film shows the true unpreparedness of any government in the world. It shows that we have no defence against these weapons and that we stand no chance if one were to drop on my head.\n\nThis film is not for the faint of heart. It has explicit images of the weapon's effects on humans. Burns that rip off the skin, shockwaves that send glass flying and radioactive fallout that causes a slow, painful death. It constantly has images and themes of death; the second two acts are depressing and dark.\n\nI would recommend this film as a serious \"We know what we are getting into\" film. It highlights the nature of nuclear weapons, and it shows their true colours, with the importance of the destruction of these weapons before it is too late. As the film subtitle says, \"It is the closest you ever want to come to nuclear war.\"\n\nStrangely, the film doesn't explicitly say \"nuclear weapons are bad\". Does it make a case against them? Absolutely. But it manages to stay coldly neutral, showing the effects of nuclear weapons as both numbers on a screen or burnt corpses under rubble. It lets the audience see the effects and tries to convince them as a *res ipsa loquitur* (it speaks for itself) approach.\n\nI especially find the film's messages relatable to modern-day society and our current geo-political climate. The threat of nuclear war is predicted to be as high, if not higher, than the detente of the 1990s and 2000s, not obviously because of the conflict in Ukraine, but unstable terror groups and rogue states, it could only take one before the gloves are off and we enter into a scene from Threads of our own.\n\nBut despite the film's exceeding dark tone, I still highly recommend you watch it. It's important that, as one of seven recognised nuclear powers, people from the UK (or any nuclear power) understand what devastating effects nuclear weapons have. It's low budget, and the obscure cast also sells the idea that it's a real tragedy, targeting real people. If you want to check out the film, it is free on the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/threads_202007), but if you do watch it, I warn you of explicitly violent and upsetting images, as well as the ability to stop you from sleeping that night.\n\nEDIT: I made a mistake, threads wasn\u2019t unofficially banned from the BBC, that was War Games, another film made in the 60s. Sorry about that!",

Studio. If anyone has any information on where one may be able to find these that would be much appreciated, thank you!",

The talent and creativity in front of and behind the camera. The bravery of studio execs to allow adult themes, alcohol, smoking, sexually suggestive scenes. Inclusion of characters from competing studios/Intellectual properties.\n\nThe animation is art. It's perfectly imperfect. Today it would be CGI. Are there even living animators now who could do this or are these techniques lost to history?\n\nIs there anything else remotely like this? I can't think of anything. I'll be rewatching this tomorrow with my kids and they better damn like it ",

I met this guy two weeks ago and we've really started a great relationship, but we're not movie theater people so I thought we could rent a movie instead. I've got to come up with a movie by Wednesday but I can't think of anything! \n\nI'm looking for something along the lines of action, comedy, and maybe a romance subplot but not the main focus. Lighthearted would be good too. It needs to be a pretty neutral movie since we don't know each other very well still when it comes to movie and the like. I don't want any intimate scenes because I don't want to imply anything by the movie either. A short blurb about your impression vs what google might say would be really helpful too. TYIA!!",
