        "title": "3,400 movies later... here are my top WTFs...",
        "content": "Hi Reddit! I've been lurking here for a long time and I rarely post but I reached a milestone recently and thought it might be nice to celebrate with you by jumping on.\n\nI have been keeping a list of movies that I've watched for nearly 25 years (since I was \\~13). It started in a notebook and eventually I moved the list to a spreadsheet. I log the name of the movie, the name of the director(s), the year it was released, my own rating (out of 5), whether or not I own a physical copy, and what my thoughts were after watching it. Today that list is over 3,400 entries strong!\n\nIn honour of the last WTF movie I watched, I wanted to share a list of my most recent and memorable WTFs that I've either seen more than once or would watch again, for anyone else who likes this as a \"genre\". If you enjoyed at least one movie from this list, then I'm fairly confident you'll also enjoy any of the others which you haven't seen yet.\n\nIf you have any other WTF movies you would recommend in return, I am very grateful for your suggestions.\n\n**My top 10 WTFs**\n\nIn no particular order and released within the last 20 years:\n\n* [The Substance (2024)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt17526714/) \\- I finally got around to seeing this today, and I haven't said WTF this much in a very long time. I thought it was utterly brilliant.\n* [Hereditary (2018)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7784604/) \\- one of the only true \"horror\" movies on this list. Difficult to unsee. Genuinely scary.\n* [Kill List (2011)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1788391/) \\- very original, completely unexpected. I watched it a second time with audio commentary from the cast which I thought was really interesting.\n* [Eden Lake (2008)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1020530/) \\- not the ending I was hoping for, but a total bucket of WTFs from start to finish.\n* [I Saw the Devil (2010)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1588170/) \\- one of two Korean entries on this list. Really brilliantly done. Just when you think it can't be more WTF, it gets more WTF...\n* [Parasite (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6751668/) \\- the second of the two Korean movies, with completely unexpected scenes out of the blue that had me saying WTF for a very long time.\n* [The Menu (2022)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9764362/) \\- another insane rollercoaster of WTF that just keeps building.\n* [Midsommar (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8772262/) \\- this movie had Wicker Man vibes but I was really much more freaked out watching this. There is at least one total WTF scene that you will definitely say WTF to... and then it almost immediately hits you again.\n* [The House That Jack Built (2018)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4003440/) \\- this is kind of a modern take on Dante's Divine Comedy, it's quite... \"poetic\"... and as far as serial killer movies go, this is really out there as one of the most WTF ever. Great soundtrack too.\n* [Der Goldene Handschuh (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/de/title/tt7670212/) \\- the only time I've ever paused a movie to take a photo and send a WhatsApp to the friend that recommended it... total WTF from start to finish, bordering on over the top, but I'd probably watch it again so I'll mention it. It's also \"based on a true story\"... which makes it even more WTF.\n\n**Honorable Mentions:**\n\n* [The Platform (2019) ](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8228288/)\\- I thought this was very original, and it had quite a lot of WTF moments. Not sure it needed a sequel though?\n* [We Need to Talk About Kevin (2011)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1242460/) \\- so many WTF moments...\n* [Tusk (2014)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3099498/) \\- I've never really seen anything else quite like this. I remember sitting through the credits and the only recurring thought was... \"WTFAF was that?!\". I haven't seen it a second time but I would definitely watch it again.\n* [Three\u2026 Extremes (2004)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420251/) \\- this was really on the verge of being too much and it's technically three short films blended into a feature, it's also the oldest on this entire list, but I've watched it more than once and it is uniquely WTF. You probably won't want to eat anything before, during, or after seeing this movie.\n* [Uncut Gems (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5727208/) \\- whilst not entirely WTF the whole way through, that ending came out of nowhere and it hit me hard.... I watched it twice. Brilliant.\n* [The Perfect Host (2010)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1334553/) \\- can't believe I forgot about this. I couldn't remember the name.\n\nI wanted to add that I've deliberately avoided the more \"extreme\" WTFs. There are several that I've seen that were so excessive, WTF doesn't quite cut it. If you want to see the most messed up shock cinema, there are several entries that come up quite frequently in other WTF threads which I've seen over the years of lurking here. For what it's worth, I think when a movie reaches the point of sacrificing any sincerity or logic in its story in favour of shock value, it's lost its entertainment value completely for me, hence the aversion to mentioning those titles here.\n\n**Edits:**\n\n24.08 - I swapped *The Menu* with *Uncut Gems* because I totally agree with some of the comments. Uncut Gems wasn't overly WTF, whereas The Menu really was WTF the whole way through. I also wanted to say a **huge thanks** for the support and comments, I never expected this to take off and the many suggestions you have given me will keep me busy for weeks!",

He attempts to justify it by stating his wife just gave birth and you can't imagine what's going on down there. \n\nMelissa's character responds something along the lines of he's got a lot of nerve to dry that to the mother of his children, he's blessed, her body goes through so much and so on.\n\nI think about this every time I'm upset with my wife, how I'm lucky to have her, and it doesn't matter what she looks like all the time after giving multiple births.  Or when I'm looking at other husbands doing similar things to their wives.  There are others, but this scene holds a special place in my head. ",

        "title": "Which movie twist completely blew your mind the first time? (Spoilers allowed)",
        "content": "For me, it has to be The Sixth Sense. I remember watching it for the first time not knowing anything about the plot, and when the twist finally hit\u2014that Bruce Willis\u2019 character was dead the whole time\u2014it honestly flipped my brain. I sat in silence for a good five minutes just replaying the whole movie in my head. Suddenly, all those little details made sense, and I realized how carefully the film was crafted to hide the truth in plain sight.\n\nWhat I really appreciate is how the twist doesn\u2019t feel cheap. Some movies throw in a random reveal at the end just for shock value, but The Sixth Sense actually becomes a richer film after you know the ending. Rewatching it feels like a completely different experience, almost like you\u2019re seeing it from another perspective.\n\nAnother one that stuck with me was Fight Club. I didn\u2019t see it coming at all that Tyler Durden and the narrator were the same person. It completely reframed not just the character interactions, but also the movie\u2019s commentary on consumerism and identity. Again, it\u2019s the type of twist that rewards rewatching\u2014you pick up on so many subtle clues that you just miss the first time around.\n\nSo my question is: what\u2019s that one movie twist that left you stunned the first time you saw it? And more importantly, did the twist make the movie better for you, or did it feel like a gimmick?",

I think it\u2019s brilliantly made film, and I wish David Byrne had done more films. \n\nI find the art direction, cinematography and set design to be very well done especially with how shots are framed and the color schemes. There are a lot of subtle details to add to the story or just there for comedic value. The script is filled with short narrations or one liners that have little to do with the characters or plot but provide  hilarious comedic moments. Upon rewatching I saw a lot of elements that I previously missed. \n\nIm curious what other people think of it and if there are similar films that I should check out. This movie is reminiscent of Edward scissorhands and napoleon dynamite for me. ",

He used to conduct it himself.\n\nTonight I went... it was great. The scores they did was Hook, Far and Away, Memoirs of a Geisha, Jaws, Indiana Jones, E.T,, Star Wars was the big ender going on for maybe 20-30 minutes. (I forgot they started the second half with Superman.)\n\nThey included smaller pieces from movies like Dial of Destiny which whatever you think of the movie this piece was incredible with a single violinist as the focus. And the Jaws score for when they all go out on the boat.\n\nWhen the Star Wars segment begins a ton of lightsabers light up in the crowd... the whole place is lit up... it's pretty gorgeous.\n\n[Light Sabers John Williams](https://legendary-digital-network-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/15101902/Maestro-of-the-Movies-Celebrating-the-Music-of-John-Williams-at-the-hollywood-bowl.webp)\n\nThey couldn't do all his stuff of course. It changes a bit year to year.\n\nOh and they did as a nod to Lalo Schifrin who just passed away 2 months ago, the Mission Impossible theme which sounded so freaking good at the bowl with that orchestra.\n\nYou have a favorite?

        "title": "School of Life (2017)",
        "content": "The plot of this movie is simple. Paul, a young orphan gets placed with a couple in the countryside. He\u2019s restless, angry and doesn\u2019t fit into their world. But then he meets Totoche, an older poacher who lives close to nature, outside the rules and structures of the estate. Slowly Totoche introduces Paul to the forest, it\u2019s animals, rivers and a new way of seeing the world. Through that relationship Paul not only learns about the natural world but also starts to find himself. \n\nThis film shows learning as something lived, not taught. About what it means to grow up, to be shaped by people and that education isn\u2019t limited to books and classrooms. Totoche never gives Paul motivational speeches. He doesn\u2019t sit Paul down to teach him lessons. He doesn\u2019t deliver long speeches about life. He just lives his own life fully and brings Paul alongside him. Paul learns by being with him, walking the woods, watching how he moves, listening when he chooses to speak. That dynamic feels real because that\u2019s how so much of life works. The people who shape us most usually don\u2019t realize they\u2019re doing it. They\u2019re just living in a way that leaves an impression.\n\nFor me, it made me reflect on my own Totoche figures. People who never tried to educate me but who shaped me through how they carried themselves. They just modeled a way of being and in their company I absorbed lessons I couldn\u2019t have gotten from a book. The most important lessons in my life came not from words but from watching patience, kindness and resilience in action.\n\nThe movie also got me thinking about how disconnected many of us are from the kind of learning Paul goes through. We spend so much of life indoors, staring at screens, rushing through routines and measuring ourselves by grades, pay checks or achievements. Kids get boxed into rigid systems that measure performance instead of curiosity. \n\nBut here\u2019s this kid, who starts with nothing, gaining a whole new sense of himself just by being present in the natural world and around someone who cared enough to share it with him. \n\nSome of the deepest growth happens in unscheduled moments, wandering, observing, being around people who live with integrity or even sitting in silence with nature. Watching Paul go from a sheltered, angry boy to someone awakening to wonder and responsibility made me think how much we lose when we forget that.\n\nAnother part that stayed with me was the idea of legacy. Totoche is old, nearing the end of his own journey but by passing on what he knows of the forest, he ensures it lives on in Paul. It made me think about the kind of legacy each of us leaves, not in terms of achievements but in terms of values and presence. Someone may not remember our advice but they\u2019ll remember how we made them feel or what they absorbed just by being with us.\n\nI also kept asking myself, am I surviving or am I actually living. It\u2019s easy to get stuck in routines where you wake up, go through the motions, and call that life. But this movie portrays that living has more to do with attention, paying attention to the natural world, to the people around us and to how we ourselves show up.\n\nBy the end of the film, I wasn\u2019t only thinking about Paul or Totoche. I was thinking about who my own mentors have been and whether I\u2019ve been able to show up that way for others. Because the truth is, all of us are probably someone\u2019s Totoche already and what they\u2019ll take from us isn\u2019t our words, it\u2019s our way of being. \n\nSo if you\u2019re looking for a film that\u2019s slower and maybe not for everyone (it\u2019s very patient, very nature-driven), I\u2019d recommend it. It\u2019s beautiful to look at but more than that, it\u2019s a reminder of where wisdom really comes from, not from institutions but from experience, presence and the quiet influence of those who choose to live with care.\n\nWe all need a Totoche in our lives, someone who shows us another way of being without forcing it. But equally, we all have the opportunity to be that person for someone else. Not through speeches or big gestures but through how we live day to day. How we treat others. How we pay attention. How we model patience &amp; resilience. This movie points to truths we all sort of know deep down but forget in the noise of everyday life.",
