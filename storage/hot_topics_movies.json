        "title": "'Dark City' (1998) - The Matrix's weirder, more mysterious older brother",
        "content": "Dark City seems to have been somewhat forgotten in the wake of The Matrix's sheer cultural presence and overwhelming popularity. It's easy to see why they're compared so often - both feature a lost, directionless protagonist adrift in a seemingly mundane world that hides the \"real\" world, and deals with a narrative where said protagonist uncovers what lies behind the curtain. \n\nDark City really needs to be seen and experienced though, as aside from these superficial similarities, it's very much its own unique beast and not just a proto-Matrix. \n\nWhat really sets Dark City apart are two things - the visual design and narrative direction. This is an absolutely *incredible* looking movie. The set design, the use of lighting and shadows, and the general ambiance is almost tangible and creates a surreal, dreamlike atmosphere. There's an almost organic, gothic feel in its aesthetics. It really succeeds in making you feel as lost and directionless as John Murdoch. \n\nThe overall story is really compelling as well, and I love the way it goes from a mystery to a sci-fi thriller and damn near cosmic horror at the end when we realize the true nature of the City and the strangers. Alex Proyas wisely keeps the lore rather mysterious and hazy - we never really know who the Strangers truly are, and their objective of understanding human souls is rather nebulous. But it works, and it adds to the hazy, dream logic feel of the movie. \n\nI do have some issues with it though. The characters are fairly dull and one-dimensional - but I guess since they're literally a different person every night or so, it makes sense kind of lol. Still, it's hard to actually care what's happening to them. I also wasn't a big fan of either Rufus Sewell or Kiefer Sutherland's performances. Rufus Sewell felt very stiff and wooden, and Kiefer's performance was just really wacky. The action scenes also feel rather stilted and clumsy, with the final telekinetic battle being the worst culprit.\n\nWith that being said, this movie is worth watching simply because of the vibes, and acts as a moodier, stranger relative to The Matrix if you're into these kinds of narratives.",

Is there a name for this trope?\n\nEdit: I personally think this does not fall under deus ex machina because it\u2019s still somewhat realistic to use an improvised weapon in a fight but it\u2019s definitely similiar to deus ex machina and feels like lazy writing to me\n\nEdit 2: It\u2019s apparently called \u201dWithin arm\u2019s reach\u201d but I like the term \u201dconvenient cudgel\u201d invented by the comments better :)",

It's a highly entertaining, humorous, and overtly anti-fascist film (so much so that, in today\u2019s political climate, it might even be labeled \u201cwoke\u201d). The characters go through compelling and complete arcs, and the ending is perfectly suited to the story. On a technical level, the lighting, sound, and cinematography are exceptional, especially for the time period. It\u2019s no coincidence that it is considered one of the greatest and most influential films ever made, and rightfully so IMO. ",

        "content": "I watched this having watched a video discussing the movie. I think this is probably the most emotional a movie has ever made me, and I'm not even American so god knows how it would make someone who lives there feel. \n\nThe connection you feel through watching everyone go through their day and realising what is going to happen to them is heartbreaking, one of the things that made me  really tear up is the discussion circle where the kids are having a discussion about how to tell if someones gay and the way it goes round all their faces and you're just thinking how bright these people are and what they would of done, their hopes, dreams, anxieties, it is soul destroying. \n\nAs well as Elias and his clear passion for photography, and everything John is going through but still manages to put on a cheerful and outgoing demeanour. \n\nThe soundacape is phenominal and it's so eerie when it's focusing on Alex when he's going around shooting and you get a sorted of distorted school chatter noise. \n\nThis films cinematography is great and everything just feels so real. \n\nBut I did have a theory and I want to know of anyone else thinks it may of been a legitimate choice of the director. John is wearing Yellow if you look at the main connotations and things associated with yellow you'll get it represents, Joyfulness, Happiness and energy, but if you look at some other meanings you also get caution, I feel like that fits Johns role in the film perfectly he is immediatly cautious when seeing Alex and his friend Eric entering the school, he immediatly knows something is up and then proceeds to run around the perimiter of the school to warn people not to go in. \n\nFollowing the themes of colours Nathan wears a red lifeguard hoodie, Red symbolises Love, Passion, Excitment, but also Danger Both Nathan and Michelle wear these colours. And I think it's more apt for Michelle because she is the first victim. Her wearing her red sweater symbolises she is in Danger from the beginning. Could be all nothing but Idk the colours just kind of switched something on for me. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on the movie and did you notice or piece together something that you think may of held meaning?
