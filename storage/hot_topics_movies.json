I've already put a reserve for 100 tickets (first come first serve) to redditors everywhere.\n\nIf you're in NYC and want to come watch this very special IMAX release + Q&amp;A,\n\njust RSVP: by sending \u201cr/movies + Yourname\u201d to\u00a0[ainsleymcgovern@falcoink.com](mailto:ainsleymcgovern@falcoink.com)",

It was a prison story, a kind which I hadn't actually tried before. The story started simple but the characters clicked with me instantly.\n\nI liked most of them.\n\nThe movie is slow, but in a good way. It doesn't rush important moments. The characters feel real, especially the friendship between Andy and Red. That's honestly the best part of the movie for me.\n\nThe moving didn't have flashy actions scenes and stuff but it still touched me, the ending was amazing and I stared at the end credits for a solid minute or two after it ended.\n\nSo for me it would be an easy 10/10",

The car scene with Toni Collette when he finally opens up. It feels raw and real, like a kid finally telling the truth he has been holding in for years.\n\nWhat is your pick?

Seth Rogen looks twitchy as hell every time it\u2019s mentioned in interviews, Emma Watson walked off set, Danny McBride has mentioned competitive one-upping and the Jay Baruchel and Jonah Hill dislike is fascinating too, like was it a personality clash or something deeper?\n\nAlso culturally it felt like the last of an era of very male, very Apatow-y comedy movies that dominated the 2000s and early 2010s. I\u2019m not sure whether that\u2019s a good or bad thing, suppose that\u2019s for discussion.\n\nI would kill for a tell-all documentary with the actors and people behind it behind all of the drama and to justify its existence, but what else deserves the treatment?",

        "content": "I am unapologetic about the fact that this is one of my favorite movies of all time. Admittedly, I am an emotional guy. I can be moved to tears with relative ease. But, after losing my father to an accident (aged 59) in 2011, and my younger brother, who was my best friend, (aged 40) to a sudden and unexpected heart attack in 2019... Any media to do with brothers or fathers or sons... can REALLY work me up. And Warrior is just perfection to me. The performances are so beautifully raw. I'm sure that if I step back and look at the film I could find flaws or aspects that could have been done better, etc, but as a piece of art, no movie has EVER moved my heart and soul (whatever that means) so strongly and suddenly. Like, we're talkin Ugly Cry territory. It should be noted that this film also brought my 3 children and my wife to tears as well, but they are less emotional, generally speaking, than I am. \n\nI am curious if anyone else feels this way or if I am just a silly little baby man who with some sort of unaddressed trauma that I am unaware of from my childhood. :-)\n\nAlso... I yearn to find another film that moves me like this. So if you have any recommendations I am all ears.\n\n(Side note: I also cry every time during the relatively benign film \"October Sky\" during the scene where Chris Cooper's character shows up for his son's rocket launch.)\n\nI should also point out that I was not estranged from my father. And we were relatively close, I think.",

I've never seen Heat, and I only saw Miami Vice once a VERY long time ago, like back when Blockbuster was still a thing. LOL I think I saw ***Manhunter*** a very long time ago. I can't remember if I saw ***Public Enemies***, the cast has me wanting to see it. I absolutely LOVED ***The Last of the Mohicans***; I need to see this one again.\n\nWhat about these movies? Are any of these worth seeing?  \nAli / Blackhat / Ferrari / The Insider / The Keep / Straight Time / Thief",

        "title": "'How To Make A Killing' - Review Thread",
        "content": "*Disowned at birth by his wealthy family, Becket Redfellow will stop at nothing to reclaim his inheritance, no matter how many relatives stand in his way.*\n\nDirector: John Patton Ford\n\nCast: Glen Powell, Margaret Qualley, Jessica Henwick, Topher Grace, Ed Harris, Zach Woods\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [58%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/how_to_make_a_killing_2026)\n\n**Metacritic:** [54 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/how-to-make-a-killing/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[The Wrap - Matt Goldberg](https://www.thewrap.com/creative-content/movies/how-to-make-a-killing-glen-powell-a24-review/) \\- 4 / 5\n\n&gt;How to Make a Killing has the acuity to know that even if you are willing to play such a rigged game in ruthless fashion, you\u2019ll still lose. The film\u2019s magic trick is taking this bleak idea and knowing how to find the fun in such brutal sport.\n\n[Slash Film - Bill Bria](https://www.slashfilm.com/2104095/how-to-make-a-killing-review/) \\- 7 / 10\n\n&gt;Powell's Becket recalls similar upwardly mobile antiheroes like Saul Goodman or Michael Corleone, characters who seem to be living a wish fulfillment of righteousness, only to find themselves trapped by the persona they've built up. It's this aspect which Ford addresses most subtly, ultimately making \"How to Make a Killing\" a cleverly scathing indictment of the American dream as it stands. It's also an impressively multi-layered indictment, too, for while it'd be easy (and rather popular) for Ford to point out how the haves and the have-nots aren't all that different from each other if they were able to switch places, the filmmaker instead leans into the complexity and systemic issues surrounding wealth and success. \"How to Make a Killing\" is a movie that sneaks up on you, and like Becket himself, doesn't simply stab you in the chest or punch you in the gut. Instead, it slowly poisons you, leaving you bewildered by the end as to how sick you and the country you live in has become.\n\n[AV Club - Jacob Oller](https://www.avclub.com/how-to-make-a-killing-review) \\- 'C'\n\n&gt;At the center of it all is Powell, making the same face for an hour and 45 minutes, too unflappable to root for, too smug to magnetize as an inhuman American Psycho. And *How To Make A Killing* needed to pick a side, either of clownish class comedy or of bitter sociopathic satire. Its split-difference approach certainly racks up a sizable body count, but its most battered and bruised victim is the truism it keeps hitting: In America, there are no consequences for the rich, unless other rich people desire it. That\u2019s almost funny, in an empty and respectable way, like how a *New Yorker* cartoon is almost funny, or how Glen Powell is almost a leading man.\n\n[Next Best Picture - Matt Neglia](https://nextbestpicture.com/how-to-make-a-killing/) \\- 6 / 10\n\n&gt;As someone who absolutely loves any kind of a crime film, \u201cHow To Make A Killing\u201d can be entertaining at times as a morality play wrapped in designer suits and generational spite. It\u2019s juggling a lot more than it needs to, and it never fully synthesizes its most perceptive ideas, but it\u2019s powered by another star performance from Powell, keeping it barely afloat.\n\n[Slant Magazine - Alexander Mooney](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/how-to-make-a-killing-review-glen-powell-john-patton-ford/) \\- 3 / 4\n\n&gt;The brittle humanity of Ford\u2019s characters is the key ingredient to his film\u2019s grim sense of irony. In a media landscape replete with hot-button satires and airless farces, *How to Make a Killing*\u2019s rejection of formal frippery and easy caricature is refreshing. Ford cultivates an old-school flair while keeping one finger on the pulse of the current moment, shrewdly retooling the canonical story of a rotten family patronage to comment on a quintessential American birthright: the compulsive desire for individual gain.\n\n[Variety - Owen Glieberman](https://variety.com/2026/film/reviews/how-to-make-a-killing-review-glen-powell-margaret-qualley-1236666029/)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s likely that 95 percent of the people who go to see \u201cHow to Make a Killing\u201d will never have seen, or even heard of, \u201cKind Hearts and Coronets,\u201d the 1949 British black comedy it\u2019s a remake of \u2014 or, I should say, a reimagining, since for once that marketing-spin term applies. In its day, \u201cKind Hearts and Coronets\u201d was wickedly outrageous. But in the age of \u201cDexter\u201d and \u201cSuccession\u201d and \u201cBeef,\u201d \u201cHow to Make a Killing\u201d just plays as a patchy amusement. Yet I was held by it; the film\u2019s acrid riffs on the hidden depravity of the new greed culture keep it aloft. And each time Margaret Qualley shows up, she gives the movie a charge, because of how her Julia incarnates money hunger cut off from everything else. Qualley somehow makes that fun, maybe because it\u2019s the one thing in the movie that everyone can agree on.",
