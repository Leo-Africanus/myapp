        "content": "Even more specifically, the actions and choices made by the characters directly impact the next event and make the situation worse or bigger somehow.\n\nThe best example I can think of is [this clip from Malcolm in the Middle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbSehcT19u0). If you can't watch it, Hal has to fix a light bulb, so he grabs a light bulb, but notices a problem with the shelf. In doing so, he realizes the shelf is unstable, so he grabs a screwdriver from a drawer. The drawer, is squeaky, so naturally he looks for WD40 to correct that, but it's out. So he hops in his car to get some more WD40, and wouldn't you know it, his car won't start. Lois comes home and sees the light is out. She goes to the garage to tell Hal to change the light, and he yells back, exasperated, \"What does it look like I'm doing?!\"\n\nAnyway, what movies you can think of which more or less follow this kind of pattern with cascading chaotic sequences? What's the most entertaining example you can think of?",

As a bonus, one has a 63 on Metacritic, the other a 64. Almost identical in every way. Both also premiered at a film festival in 2024 around the same time (one at Cannes in May and the other a few weeks later at Tribeca June). Both are internationally co-produced films and include Belgium and the US as production partners.\n\nOne is about an isolated fishing village in the artic, and the other is about an isolated Civil War company on the American frontier. Both really solid films as well. Both are slow burns and pretty philosophical. I preferred the artic one by a wide margin but both have strengths.\n\nTrailer for **The Damned**, Civil War film: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjL0sNvX_VM\n\nTrailer for **The Damned**, artic horror film: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itnHQHgxUI",

        "title": "Most realistic addiction movies you've seen? ",
        "content": "There are lots of good addiction movies but I'm not sure how many are very realistic. Like take the case of Requiem for a Dream. It's a terrifying movie and a unique experience of horror but not so much a realistic drug movie. It's more like what if everything goes wrong times 100.\n\nSpecifically, it's sort  of a horror movie that uses drugs as its language, than a movie about what a life of addiction looks like. It gets some details wrong too, like in reality heroin makes you chill not all excited and energized. But no denying the movie works great as anti-drug advertising. Show that to some young person to scare them straight.\n\nLeaving Las Vegas, in contrast, is a lot more \"realistic,\" or accurate in terms of what it's like for someone to abuse alcohol and become addicted. I find it to be one of Cage's best films. If you think Cage sucks as an actor, just watch this movie. Or if you think drinking is fun, just watch this movie to see how drinking can easily become a tool of self-destruction.\n\nThe movie is in some ways boring and depressing, nothing like your typical movies about people drinking and partying, but that's what alcoholism is. It's when you take refuge in drink, when you become its slave, when you drink because you have to and not because you want to. It's a slow suicide.\n\nSo my question is which addiction movies you find realistic, especially if you or someone you know has done drugs or alcohol.",

The ending is bitter and frustrating so a great film overall with a wonderful cast who all went on to do well. \n\nBut my lord how loathsome is Briony Tallis. \n\nCan we all agree that there was no atonement in this film. Zero. Briony was arrogant and self-serving to the bitter end.\n\nShe ruins Robbie's (James McAvoy's) life with her lie resulting in his imprisonment and later death. And ruins his sister's (Keira Knightley's) life in turn who was waiting for him to return from war. \n\nShe then goes on to live a full and successful life as an author with this being her 21st novel and she has the audacity, arrogance and smugness to mislead further about how in the end she gave them their happy ending because they didn't get one in life as though this was a merciful act.\n\nThis just rings hollow as she has continued to fabricate her lies and mistruths condescendingly even in old age. There was no atonement or anything close. \n\nAt every opportunity she fails in correcting her lie other than this fanciful version of events she conjures up as to way to forgive herself. The final scene with her, as joyless as ever, caps it all off.\n\nEven in death she harvested their story for personal gain and acclaim, only subverting what happened further.\n\nTLDR: Briony Tallis easily walks on to the shitlist for women in literature. \n\n ",

Even the more subtles emotions she brings says a lot about her character's context. \n\nRuth Gordon was daffy, kooky and unnerving as Minnie Castevet and I was glad she got the Oscar for it, however it's comical Mia Farrow wasn't nominated. It's almost like she got punished for giving up on her marriage with Frank Sinatra so she could continue filming.",

        "content": "Just rewatched this last night.  This movie starred Robert Redford.  Still hits home over 50 years later.\n\nA political consultant must find a Democratic to oppose three-term California Senator Crocker Jarmon in the upcoming election. With no big-name Democrat eager to enter the unwinnable race, Lucas seeks out Bill McKay, the idealistic, handsome, and charismatic son of a popular former California governor.\n\nMcKay receives a proposition: since Jarmon cannot lose and the race is already decided, McKay is free to campaign saying exactly what he wants. McKay accepts in order to have the chance to spread his values, and hits the trail. With no serious Democratic opposition, McKay cruises to the nomination on his name alone. Then, distressing news: according to the polling, McKay will be defeated by an overwhelming margin. Lucas says the party expected McKay to lose but not to be humiliated, so he convinces McKay to moderate his message to appeal to a broader range of voters. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3w4j8m02wfce1.jpg?width=452&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfed7e856289f7517be6529e56c9ae17bc89728c\n\n",

        "title": "I have always felt like Elektra (2005) got a bad rep",
        "content": "I was wrong. So wrong.\n\nRewatched it last night and man is it bad. The writing is bad. The plot is bad. The characters are bad. I never felt it was a masterpiece by any means, but at least the first time I saw it in theaters it was *fun* (but maybe that's because I was the only one there...).\n\nFirst of all, as a spinoff from Daredevil, it feels like a completely different universe. Obviously characters like Daredevil or Bullseye aren't possible but they are fairly grounded, just two dudes really good at what they do. But then Elektra goes full supernatural with resurrection, superspeed ninjas, clairvoyance, super powers, etc. just very far removed from a crime fighting blind guy (which, this one kind of has too).\n\nHowever, in this world of superpowered humans who can make their tattoos come alive, see the future, or infect areas with fatal diseases, for some reason the plot revolves around protecting a 14-year-old girl martial arts prodigy. Not super power martial arts, just regular old action movie martial arts. And she's not even really that good at it currently, she just has the potential to be.\n\nThe Treasure, as she is called, is a (potential) great warrior who can (potentially) singlehandedly tip the balance between good and evil (because that's what the bad guys are in this movie--evil for the sake of being evil) in the eternal war for (potential) dominance. But I guess also there is one every generation because Typhoid Mary (a super powerful mutant or witch I guess) was the treasure before this new one (Abby). But also that bad guys had her and she was nothing too special in the sense that the war is still going on. \n\nBut everybody agrees this Abby girl is special and must be protected because the premise is that if she falls into the hands of the other team, it's game over. Okay, cool, go team good guy. BUT, Team Good Guy (who knows who and where she is), instead of taking her in and raising her or even protecting her for most of her life, decides to just...not do any of that.\n\nUntil they decide to do exactly that. After Head Good Guy hires Elektra to kill Abby and her father (knowing that Elektra would see the light for some sensei reason) and they are all very nearly killed by mystical assassins, *then* they decide that this all powerful teenager with an okay high kick should be abducted against her will to train as a warrior. After her mother gets assassinated pre-movie (sorry, mom).\n\nElektra decides to 1v1 the head bad guy (sort of) for the girl's future which...I don't really see either side's larger coalition agreeing to but okay. Sort Of Head Bad Guy (who also for some reason murdered Elektra's mother as a child idk anymore) predictably reneges on that agreement by using his teammates (poorly) but loses anyway despite having Elektra dead to rights multiple times (she actually loses a lot in this movie lol).\n\nBut again, it's not like the bad guys (headquartered in Japan for some reason) have to honor that, they are bad guys after all so they predictably...oh no wait, they just aren't going to go after Abby anymore, Elektra says she is free. \n\nAnd then Elektra gets closure too, the end.",

        "content": "Ok I know this movie is not at all recent, but I just got around to it and love it. I\u2019m a big time loop fan.\n\nMy first thought after seeing the ending was, what if the \u201creal world\u201d we were watching was also an alternate timeline, or not the first time the source code was used. \n\nIf this captain stopped this crisis, were there previous crises on different timelines that were stopped by the captain, therefore making a new timeline where he hasn\u2019t been activated yet? So the next crisis that comes up, then creates another timeline and the process repeats?\n\nHopefully this makes sense, loved the movie.\nRIP Sean",

        "title": "Transformers One is a perfect Kid-Friendly Transformers Animation movie for younger fans of Transformers. ",
        "content": "This is mainly a fun post that I thought of making here.\n\nSo to start off:\nAs a huge Transformers fan since I was a kid(specifically a kid under the age of 13 during my elementary school years), I got really excited to watch the new animated Transformers movie ever since I first saw the trailers, promos and TV spots. I really like the song they used in the 1st trailer, I thought it was catching. I really love how very cool, fun, action-packed, funny, lighthearted, interesting, dramatic and thrilling the movie is going to be like from watching the Transformers One trailers and other clips. And the thing that I really liked the most is besides it being a Transformers movie in animation form, but it is also the fact that it's a Transformers movie that is truly kid-friendly for kids. As in like it's design primarily for a younger audience of kids(while still also for the whole family, parents who were fans of Transformers since they were kids and want to bring their own kids to watch a Transformers movie) than the live action Transformers movies. While the Michael Bay TF films were marketed towards kids, they were mostly PG-13 movies, making them more suitable to an older audience and that the movies themselves were not very appropriate for kids under the age of 13. Like the unnecessary sexual women, too much cuss words, almost graphical violence and the characters were not very good role models for kids to like and idolizes. \n\n\nBut this time, with a director who's known for making great and good kids movies(that being Josh Cooley), a Transformers animated movie for kids and families alike was finally happening. And after seeing the movie whhich was during the school holidays, it pretty much exceeded my expectations I had from the beginning. So if there is one thing that I would like to point out that the movie did right for the Transformers -  is besides it focusing on the Transformer characters themselves, but also because it was definitely a great Transformers animated movie designed to be suitable and enjoyable for kids aka a new generation of younger fans, rather than just being a \"far more mature, darker and gritty\" movie that can only be enjoyed by teenagers and adults and just abandon their core younger audience. Considering the fact that Transformers is for kids as the primary/core audience and that it has consistently been a franchise that's marketed towards a younger audience of kids(while also still being for families alike). And for the most part, it did so well with that kind of demographic, but that's mostly for the tv animated shows. The live action movies, while still has it's younger audience, they still weren't very appropriate for them. \n\n\nSo now, to add more things on why Transformers One is great for kids - especially to those kids who are fans of Transformers, the story is pretty simple, which is course the origin story of Optimus and Megatron, how the two iconic characters became rivals, the story is well-written in its own right. The movie has many things that I'm pretty sure any kids will love. \n\nIt's filled with appealing and interesting characters with good character developments and clear motivations, extraordinary CG/3D animation and visual effects, good voice acting, cool action scenes, lots of funny moments, it's lighthearted, has an interesting lore, nice worldbuilding, and lastly it has meaningful good themes and messages for the kiddos. It's such a great good vs evil tradition vibe movie. \n\n\nNow that's not to say that the movie is literally a masterpiece, because of course, like many things, it has its own problems. But there is no doubt that it's such a great kids movie as well as a great Transformers animation movie for kids/younger fans of Transformers, while at the same time is great to all families, including long time TF fans. So if you have any kids or younger siblings who are fans of Transformers, I recommend watching Transformers One, the kiddos are gonna love it. \n\n\nThank you for reading!",
