By the end, Cooper and company have crafted a winning dramedy that has elements of what makes any good rom com work. Wrapping up NYFF on a pleasant if unspectacular note, it\u2019s destined to be a very easy watch for folks, once it comes out later on this year.\n\n[Vulture - Alisson Wilmore](https://www.vulture.com/article/is-this-thing-on-review-bradley-cooper-made-a-crowd-pleaser.html)\n\n&gt;We\u2019ve seen Arnett play variations on his character before, sardonic and self-deprecating. It\u2019s Dern who\u2019s the revelation as a woman who truly doesn\u2019t know what she wants, and who is figuring it out in real time in a way that\u2019s a delight to watch.",

        "content": "I think I may have seen this movie when it first came out, but I had very little memory of it. Day off today, so I thought I\u2019d give it a go. I\u2019m sort of sorry I have. \n\nSome of my main complaints include the weird, TV-movie quality presentation (framing of shots, campy closeups, almost soap-opera-effect moments), the inexplicable changes to the origin story, and Nick Nolte\u2019s bizarre, Gary Busey level scene chewing. Beyond that, the plot is just so meh, and I\u2019m not digging on Ang Lee\u2019s direction. \n\nSo, Reddit, do any of you like this movie? What are some things you appreciated about it? What are your thoughts? ",

        "content": "The film was considered a major production in its time. $9 million to make, if I remember. Seems tame now.\n\nThe studios had really high hopes for it and it did good, but didn\u2019t take over the world the way Star Wars would, released less than a year later.\n\nEven though parts of it are clunky and dated, it\u2019s just unusual and detailed enough to remain interesting to some new audiences. I think will always maintain its cult status and be remembered as an example of what science fiction films looked like in the 1970s before Star Wars altered the genre forever (but Alien was close behind\u2026 things were changing fast).",
