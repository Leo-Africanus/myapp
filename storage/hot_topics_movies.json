When the film started, I thought I was going to get a lighthearted romcom starring Anthony Edwards and Mare Winningham. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, the main character gets a call saying nuclear war is coming in less than 70 minutes, and I'm sitting there thinking someone was playing a prank. I was not ready for the movie to shift into an apocalyptic thriller. The shift in tone was so unexpected that I just sat there watching for the next hour or so, completely baffled.",

Similarly, there\u2019s a bunch of dudes with white leathery skin and feathers near the rhino, that disappear before it can even be questioned\n\nI love all the random shit in this movie, it just throws so much craziness at you tjat you kind of have to accept the fact that the Persians have an Army of Elephants, crab clawed men, \u201cwizards\u201d, and random beast men that growl instead of yell\n\nI think it adds to the idea that it\u2019s the Spartans telling the story and exaggerating all the details to eachother to make it more crazy.",

        "content": "People have went back and forth in discussion around whether or not it was intended in Starship Troopers (1997) for the attack on Buenos Aires to have been a false flag attack perpetrated by the United Citizen Federation either intentionally or accidentally and blamed on the Arachnids. There is some minor circumstantial evidence that points to this interpretation. The officers of the Federation ship that crashed into an asteroid being young, cocky and inexperienced, Carmen nearly crashing the ship leaving dry dock, making course changes without telling anybody - what if Carmen caused this asteroid to redirect and hit Earth?\n\nKlendathu is 20k lightyears away. We see how far away it is on a map in the film, showing the bug homeworld on the other side of the galaxy. Do the bugs really have the capability to launch a direct strike on Earth?\n\nA news report says the bugs are responsible, but the movie is rife with propaganda. The movie in itself is like an in-universe propaganda recruitment piece. We can't trust what the report says. And we don't see the bugs launch an attack on Earth.\n\nBut it's also somewhat of a stretch because we don't see the asteroid Carmen hit change its trajectory towards Earth either. There is no documented evidence that a \"false flag\" attack is what Paul Verhoeven intended to convey.\n\nBut there's just enough superficial evidence to support the \"false flag\" theory if a person so chooses to interpret it that way. And the interpretation reinforces the theme of militaristic propaganda.\n\nI'm curious to read what other unconfirmed fan theories or non-canon interpretations there are of a movie that adds to the movie.",

It really holds up after 25 years.\n\nI love how they bonded together over writing stories. And how I wish I could understand- it was clear that the subtitles are conveying barely 70% of the meaning, if that.    \n\nThe music was also so beautiful and I will be playing it regularly. \n\nI guess it's not fair to compare a movie like this to the toxic schlock of hateful gender and racial ideology that is Babygirl, but it just so happens we saw them a couple of weeks apart and so comparisons were inevitable. The restraint, the sorrow, the heartache, the gentleness and dignity of the story told in In the Mood for Love is so at odds with the toxicity, cringiness, and just bad storytelling and barf factor of Babygirl.   \n\nAnyway, if you haven't seen it, or did at the time but mostly forgot about it, then go watch it if you're craving a bit of romantic movie. You won't be sorry!\n\n",

Bong Joon-ho's best English movie to date and arguably Robert Pattinson's best movie ever.\n\n[Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/mickey-17-review-robert-pattinson-b2698489.html) (5/5):\n\n&gt;This is Pattinson at his best, holding his movie star charisma hostage in order to pursue loveable weirdos in all kinds of shades. He\u2019s fully liberated here, consistently finding the most unexpected and delightful ways to deliver a line.\n\n[IndieWire] (https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/mickey-17-review-robert-pattinson-bong-joon-ho-1235095954/) (A-):\n\n&gt;I\u2019d argue that \u201cMickey 17,\u201d the best and most cohesive of Bong\u2019s English-language films, offers such exciting proof of Bong\u2019s genius precisely because it feels like such a clear amalgamation of his previous two, [Snowpiercer and Okja].\n\n[Slashfilm] (https://www.slashfilm.com/1790524/mickey-17-review/) (9/10):\n\n&gt;\"Mickey 17\" is a deeply heartfelt and uncomfortably funny musing on capitalism, colonization, and corruption. It's a perfect film for our time, and Bong Joon-ho's best English-language film yet.\n\n[Vulture] (https://www.vulture.com/article/mickey-17-review-bong-joon-hos-bitter-take-on-america.html):\n\n&gt;By showing that even the most resigned of sci-fi doormats can decide to stand up for himself, Mickey 17 ends on a more hopeful note than the rest of Bong\u2019s films. It\u2019s more hopeful than we currently deserve.\n\n[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/mickey-17-review-robert-pattinson/) (4/5):\n\n&gt;Who is this mad confection for? The answer should be as obvious as the question is tedious: anyone longing for the sort of sui generis romp a cinematic \u201cuniverse\u201d could never allow itself to get away with, given a 17- or even 170-film run-up.\n\n[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/mickey-17/) (4/5):\n\n&gt;Like Mickey himself, it\u2019s goofy and a little inconsistent, but it\u2019s also funny, thoughtful and more plausible than we might like. A charming space oddity for these unusual times.\n\n[The Wrap] (https://www.thewrap.com/mickey-17-review-robert-pattinson/):\n\n&gt;A teen-idol turned auteur-darling turned action-lead, Pattinson could easily call comedy his true calling, here delivering an elastic physical performance as dexterous as Jim Carrey in his prime.\n\n[The Guardian] (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/15/mickey-17-review-robert-pattinson-proves-expendable-in-bong-joon-hos-eerily-cheery-cloning-drama) (3/5):\n\n&gt;Mickey 17 is visually spectacular with some very sharp, angular moments of pathos and horror... But at two hours and 17 minutes, this is a baggy and sometimes loose film whose narrative tendons are a bit slack sometimes.\n\n[BBC] (https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250215-mickey-17-oscar-winning-director-bong-joon-hos-confused-sci-fi-blockbuster-is-a-serious-disappointment) (2/5):\n\n&gt;The bad news -- and possibly an explanation for its delays in release -- is that it doesn't really know what approach it wants to take instead. All in all, it must be considered a serious disappointment from the director.\n\n\n**Synopsis**:\n\n&gt;The unlikely hero, Mickey Barnes has found himself in the extraordinary circumstance of working for an employer who demands the ultimate commitment to the job\u2026 to die, for a living.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Robert Pattinson as Mickey Barnes\n* Naomi Ackie as Nasha Adjaya\n* Steven Yeun as Timo\n* Toni Collette as Ylfa\n* Mark Ruffalo as Kenneth Marshall\n* Holliday Grainger as Gemma\n* Anamaria Vartolomei as Kai Katz\n* Thomas Turgoose\n* Angus Imrie as Shrimp Eyes\n* Cameron Britton as Arkady\n* Patsy Ferran\n* Daniel Henshall\n* Steve Park as Agent Zeke\n* Tim Key\n\nDirected by: Bong Joon-ho\n\nScreenplay by: Bong Joon-ho\n\nBased on: \t*Mickey7* by Edward Ashton\n\nProduced by: Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner, Bong Joon-ho, Dooho Choi\n\nCinematography: Darius Khondji\n\nEdited by: Yang Jin-mo\n\nMusic by: Jung Jae-il\n\nRunning time: 137 minutes\n\nRelease dates: February 28, 2025 (South Korea), March 7, 2025 (United States)",

I'm currently rewatching it for about the twentieth time and I've never been able to understand it.\n\nThey say it's a game of deception, and the game involves all the dice, not just your own. How can you be deceptive when you have no idea what the other players' dice are showing?\n\nTo me it just seems like gibberish, like they're all just saying random numbers, but these movies are way too well-written for the game to not make sense. I would like to understand how the game works because it's the only thing that bugs me about this movie. ",

I didn't want to mess around with finding something so I saw 'Flow' was an Oscar nominee and thought I would give it a try.\n\nIt's animated, it's gorgeous early on, particularly how it depicted the depth of water while also giving reflections on the water. It had a cute cat and some fun dogs so I thought I would give it 20 minutes while I ate.\n\nI didn't stop watching until a lot of the credits were rolling. No dialog aside from barks, meows and various animal noises.\n\nI found it to be beautiful and really enjoyed it. \n\nHas anybody else seen it? ",

Gerard Butler with a thick Scottish accent playing and old Transylvanian \ud83e\udd23\n\nThere was this backstory though that blew my mind.  Dracula was revealed to actually be Judas Iscariot who was punished by God for betraying Jesus.  He was hung at dawn as his 30 pieces of silver he got for betraying Jesus fell to the ground.  When he awoke  he was told he was cursed to walk the Earth as a leech and never see another sunrise. \n\nThis explained why Silver hurt him and dawn could kill him.  \n\nI thought for years about how good that was and what a great movie that could have made from a good Director.

        "content": "Been watching all the terminator movies recently, and t3 is not what I would call a strong entry. It's a very safe and corporate version of T2, that is until the very last 5 minutes. Judgement day happens as it's revealed that skynet has become an omnipresent piece of software incapable of being simply turned off. The characters pretty much lose everything except their lives, though there is the promise of eventual victory based on this alone. It's such a tragic yet hopeful ending, shot well, scored well, even the monologue from the film's lackluster John Connor is pretty decent. It's sad that the franchise really never got better than these 5 minutes in over 20 years and 3 movies (I like salvation but man is it kind of a fucking dumb movie lol).",

My opinion at the start wasn't all that good as I wasn't convinced that this movie was worth buying as in the UK and Ireland not a single Bond movie is on any streaming service, but wow, by the time we reached the archive shootout I no longer cared, it was money well spent. \nNow I am going to start off with the negatives.\n\nNegatives \n\nPositvies\nBoris is a pretty good villain, the general is alright and 006 is good too. I liked the bond girl and her story arc but not how she eventually became a love intrest if that didn't happen I'd like this even more. Brosnan is pretty good at making Bond more modern, pretty much everything else in this movie i liked, cinematography, music, acting, etc. \n\nI am going to give Goldeneye a 9.45/10\n\n\nEdit: I have seen a lot of the Bond movies. I am not new to the franchise. ",

I wanted to see if you guys might have the answer to it. \n\n  \nI'm somewhat of a beginner when it comes to understanding aspect ratios and how different size film formats impact the aspect ratio a film is shown in. From what I've read, the Brutalist was shown at a 1.66:1 ratio. However there were several shots during the epilogue and if I recall correctly, during the beginning of the second half as well that looked closer to 4:3 or even 1:1. Any idea why they chose to do that for certain shots only?\n\nReally looking forward to your guy's take on it.",

As a soon to be dad I honestly teared up a few times. \n\nGeneral thoughts:\n\n1) Steve Martin is in his prime. The man is just funny, IMO way above Ben stiller or Adam Sandler who I often hear hes compared to\n\u201cOf his time\u201d \n\n2) The whole Mark character arc throughout the movie already knowing he\u2019s the outlier hits way harder. He shows signs of being an outcast like 12 minutes in but didn\u2019t know it til you knew it!\n\n3) The plot line in general is very solid, two parents trying to live their dreams at the same time, inconveniently, but figuring out a way to make it work. And making sacrifices for their family- Shake: \u201cgiving up the dream?\u201d Coach: \u201cJust going with a different one\u201d \ud83e\udd79\n\nAnd all with a tolerable cast. Like Jesus, today these movies are so bad and just unwatchable. Cheaper by the dozen is one I\u2019ll show my kids and also enjoy while disseminating a good message. \n\n4) Ashton plays a fantastic douche bag! ",
