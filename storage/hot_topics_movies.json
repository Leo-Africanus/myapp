        "content": "For this I'm not really thinking of improv takes for comedy films, but I guess that can fit. But just recently I've seen multiple actors/directors talking about a take that was originally just meant to be funny but ended up getting used in the final product. Examples:\n\n- **A Real Pain**: after tour guide James is saying a heartfelt thank you and goodbye to Benji and just turns and nonchalantly and flatly tells David thanks. James' actor has said that that was just meant to be funny and even Jess Eisenberg originally though the take was \"ruined\" but ended up loving it and using it.\n\n- **Leon the Professional**: Gary Oldman dramatically yelling \"EVERYONE!\" was one of a couple takes that he intentionally was overdoing to make Luc Besson laugh. Turns out he liked it enough to use it in the final film.\n\n- **Severance**: TV obviously, but in the most recent episode when Mr. Milchick delivers a letter to a character and then abruptly sprints away, Tramell Tilman has said he just did that to be funny and didn't think it would be used.\n\nWhat are some more famous or interesting examples?\n\n---\n\n**EDIT**: To emphasize, I'm not necessarily interested in \"just\" improvised scenes/lines here, but specifically a delivery or take where the actor themselves thinks it's ridiculous or a joke or unusable that I'm interested in.",

        "content": "I know everyone always goes on about the Little Mermaid, Beauty &amp; The Beast, Aladdin etc. (&amp; those are wonderful films)\n\nBut for me? 1986\u2019s \u201cThe Great Mouse Detective\u201d is the **PERFECT** animated Disney film. I love practically every frame. The music, the voice acting &amp; animation? It\u2019s wonderfully charming. Disney doing Victorian era London is always special &amp; atmospheric. \n\nFor those who don\u2019t know the premise? It\u2019s simple. What if Sherlock Holmes\u2026was a mouse. Solving mice crimes. All while living in mouse hole tucked away in actual human Sherlock Holmes address of Baker Street\n\nThis movie was completed in that sweet spot where Disney had yet to make the switch to digital coloring(aka digital Ink &amp; paint aka the CAPS system) and so this film has that warmth &amp; charm that was a little bit lost when the conversion was made circa the early 1990s. It does have a very early CGI sequence in an animated film, the terrific Big Ben Clock climax. (The gears were created digitally and then traced over, not actually rendered out to film or composited digitally)\n\nSo what makes the film so special? The characters. The characters! I know this isn\u2019t technically \u201cSherlock Holmes\u201d BUT if it were, this would be my favourite rendition of the great detective. \n\nLike all great Sherlock adaptations it\u2019s the Sherlock/Watson relationship that is the true measure of success and this movie takes the cake. David Q Dawson is our Watson stand in, he\u2019s a caring albeit clumsy mouse, compared to Basil\u2019s man(er..mouse) of action. They just have terrific chemistry. You buy them as friends instantly. \n\nAnd it\u2019s this reason more adventure were needed. I don\u2019t care in what form. Straight to video, animated series or legit theatrical sequel. So long as the same voice actors were used? Give me more! But alas, it was not meant to be. After Little Mermaid and the rest become huge cultural juggernauts, there was no more room for the relatively modest successful fare like The Great Mouse Detective. And we are all the poorer for it. Also unlike most those other films, this isn\u2019t a musical. There\u2019s one scene where characters break out in song. And it\u2019s great.\n\n\nI\u2019ve often wondered if Disney would do the same \u201clive action\u201d remake route befallen to so many of the animated films. Maybe in time but you\u2019ll never do better than Vincent Price as Ratigan, Barrie Ingham as Basil and Val Bettin as Dawson. RIP.\n\nAnd that score by Henry Mancini? Now that\u2019s a theme! Remember when we had memorable musical themes? \n\nSo? For those who haven\u2019t had the pleasure or for those who have &amp; haven\u2019t had the pleasure in awhile, go check out The Great Mouse Detective, bask in its charm, warmth, heart and splendor. \n\nThis movie deserved to be a franchise.",

        "content": "I never heard of this movie before and learned this is the only Martin Scorsese movie with a solo female lead. So I thought maybe Martin made this as some quick work between Mean Streets and Taxi Driver. I expected this to be a forgotten flop like New York New York or some form of oscar bait that no one talks about.\n\nTo my big surprise, it's great. I absolutely enjoyed every minute of it. I love the cast of characters and the fun journey of Alice and her son (he's hilarious) going on a road trip to pursuit her singing career. It's somewhat realistic with some domestic abuse scenes, but the overall tone is light and gentle when it comes to the main story where you can feel the love between Alice and her son while she struggles to make her way. You got a stacked cast with Ellen Burstyn as the lead, Kris Kristofferson, Harvey Keitel, Diane Ladd, and Jodie Foster making an appearance. It's really funny and a very interesting portrait of a woman in the 1970s figuring out her life after her husband passes. I can kind of see it like a 90s version of Nomadland, but this is more of a slice of life comedy than a introspective drama. \n\nI don't know why this isn't talked about when it comes to Scorsese movies. Maybe it just doesn't have the deep subject matter or the intensity of his gritty body of work, but it doesn't make it shallow or lacking an emotional core. I think the most memorable image in this movie is Ellen Burstyn holding a forced grin when working as a waitress and she gets embarrassed by the other waiters. Just a great moment.\n\nRandom thoughts\n\n* I can see why Ellen Burstyn won an oscar for this. Doing this and The Exorcist back to back blows my mind with how she has great range.\n* This movie doesn't have a single moment where I thought Scorsese was on hard drugs\n* the actor who played Alice's son grew up to work as an engineer. Good to know!\n* I couldn't find a blu-ray release, so the DVD makes the movie look kinda ancient and the colors don't seem to pop off as they should.\n* Criterion, please give this a blu-ray release.\n* \"A Jack Job in a paperSack, Get off my back!\"",

For example, I recently watched Babylon and was struck by its incredible speed. I\u2019m looking for that Kind of film, Also can be movies of comedias that have fast paced and have an enormous speed.",

It has western themes set in modern(ish) times, it's not a shoot-em-up spaghetti western but it has some old cowpokes just trying to get along in a relatively modern day as a sideshow attraction. I find it interesting and just love the general plot. ",

Maybe they\u2019re a multi-Oscar winner, or a prominent character actor, or just a big box office draw, but you just don\u2019t get it.\n\nMy big one is Richard Gere. I know you\u2019d never see him on a list of greatest actors, but he\u2019s definitely well-respected enough to have a \u201cgood actor\u201d reputation attached to him. I like a few of his movies, but I always found him to be an excruciatingly boring watch. I suppose he\u2019s not the worst, but more often than not I end up checking my watch when he\u2019s on screen.\n\nWho are yours?",

The Autobots and Decepticons have returned, but this time, their war is no longer limited to distant planets or secret battlefields. The conflict has spilled onto Earth, and humanity is caught in the crossfire. The Autobots have forged a fragile alliance with the military, while the Decepticons, led by Megatron, are more determined than ever to enslave mankind for their own power.\n\nMeanwhile, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew\u2014Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), and others\u2014are laying low after their last mission, trying to live a normal life. But their peace is shattered when a mysterious ally, Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), seeks them out for help. Optimus needs their skills in navigating dangerous streets and using vehicles to battle the Decepticons, who are now trying to take control of critical transportation routes to fuel their war effort.\n\nDom, reluctant at first, is convinced when he learns the Decepticons are targeting his family\u2014his crew, and even his daughter, Brian (Paul Walker's character\u2019s son, introduced with technology to honor his legacy). The Autobots need the best drivers and racers to infiltrate high-stakes races and sabotage Decepticon supply chains that are hidden behind underground black-market networks.. ",

I already watched LoTR extended editions, which initially got me interested, then a DnD campaign I had to write for work got me thinking more about it. I\u2019m about a year into writing and my friend asked me if I\u2019d been watching any fantasy stuff to get inspo and I realized I hadn\u2019t been! I\u2019ve been writing lore raw with latent influence from everything I\u2019d seen before, but I haven\u2019t looked for anything new yet. Any recommendations would be really appreciated :)",

It a low-budget film that follows the aftermath of the discovery that the entire population of a small desert town on the Arizona/Mexico border has mysteriously and violently vanished.  The only clues come from a roll of 35mm photos later discovered that tell a story.  The pics are super freaky and creepy; and the last two photos, geez.  No spoilers here except that I really liked the film.  All that said, I was wondering if there are other movies out there that never actually reveal the \"bad guys\" face to face.  ",
