He was as nice and unassuming as he was depicted in the movie.  He seemed very much to be legitimately surprised at the reaction to what he considered to be \"doing his job\".\n\nI thought Clint Eastwood struck the right tone with this movie to not overly dramatize this event but rather let the story play out on its own.",

So I want to know which movie you recognize as being really high quality (good production/writing/acting/etc.), but you didn't care for it. \n\nAt the same time, I want to know which movies you love, but also recognize as being very poor quality.\n\nHere's mine:\n\n* **Best movie I didn't like:** *The Godfather Part II* (1974) - It has a strong argument for being one of the best movies ever made. The acting, writing, production, everything is pretty close to flawless. I also found it to be very boring. It took me four tries to watch it all the way through because I fell asleep within the first hour the first three times.\n* **Worst movie I love:** *Highlander II: The Quickening* (1991) - This movie is terrible. The story is awful and completely undermines the rest of the franchise, regardless of which version you watch. The special effects aren't very good, and it's pretty clear that none of the actors really wanted to be there. That said, I find the melodrama to be very entertaining, and I love the Highlander franchise, even this one.\n\n",

I am kicking myself for not watching it in 1994 when it came out but I cant decide if I would have enjoyed it as much or its looking back at that 90s summer smogginess that has made me fall so hard and fast in love with it. I know Luc Besson's creepy reasons for the Mathilda/Leon relationship but Jean Reno's playing of it captured so much that feeling a pubescent girl might have for an adult man and how the adult can respect that while not tainting it and therefore keep it as the beautiful first love dream of a young girl. Just every scene including Gary Oldman's every sniff and movement as crazy DEA officer was amazing.\n\nUtterly utterly blown away. ",

So, whilst hitman movies are mainly what I\u2018m after I wouldn\u2019t be opposed to other crime films that scratch a similar itch as to what I described.
