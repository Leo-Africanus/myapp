I'll be back at 3 PM ET today to answer your questions.\n\n**Bio and more information:**\n\nFrom Peabody, Golden Globe, and Emmy Award-winning writer/producer/director Larry Charles, COMEDY SAMURAI: 40 YEARS OF BLOOD, GUTS, AND LAUGHTER is a rollicking journey through modern American comedy, as he shares behind-the-scenes stories from his life\\&amp;#39;s work.\n\nGrand Central will publish Charles\u2019s memoir on June 17, 2025. To tell Larry Charles\u2019s life story is to tell the story of modern American comedy. Over the last 40 years, few comedians have been a part of so many iconic, beloved projects. Larry was one of the original writers and producers on the first five seasons of Seinfeld, executive produced both Curb Your\n\nEnthusiasm and Entourage while directing 18 episodes of Curb and served as the showrunner for Mad About You. His film directing credits include Borat, Bruno, and The Dictator, the comic documentary Religulous (starring Bill Maher), and Masked and Anonymous (which he co-wrote with Bob Dylan who stars).\n\nIn\u00a0Comedy Samurai, Charles pulls back the curtain on the making of his successful projects, offering sharp, never-before-told anecdotes about Jerry Seinfeld, Sacha Baron Cohen, Bill Maher, Bob Dylan, Nic Cage, Mel Brooks, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, and Larry David, among many others.\n\nLarry Charles\u00a0rose from the mean streets of Brooklyn and the working-class housing projects of Donald Trump\u2019s nefarious father Fred, to become the director of\u00a0Borat,\u00a0Bruno, The Dictator\u00a0and\u00a0Religulous\u00a0amongst others. He directed Bob Dylan and an all-star cast (Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Jessica Lange and Penelope Cruz among others) in the film,\u00a0Masked an Anonymous\u00a0which he and Dylan wrote together. He has also directed numerous episodes of\u00a0Curb Your Enthusiasm\u00a0and was one of the original writers and producers of\u00a0Seinfeld. Larry is a Peabody, Golden Globe, and Emmy-award winner. Since the Malibu fires, he, and his wife and two dogs are vagabonds.\n\nBack at 3 PM ET to answer your questions!\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "[**Rotten Tomatoes:**](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/superman_2025) **87% (135 Reviews) -**  ***Certified Fresh***\n\n* **Critics Consensus**: Pulling off the heroic feat of fleshing out a dynamic new world while putting its champion's big, beating heart front and center, this\u00a0Superman\u00a0flies high as a Man of Tomorrow grounded in the here and now.\n\n[**Metacritic**:](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/superman-2025/) **71 (42 Reviews) -** ***Generally Favorable***\n\nReviews:\n\n[Variety (80)](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/superman-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet-1236444126/)\n\n&gt;The super-busy quality of \u201cSuperman\u201d works for it and, at times, against it. The movie rarely slows down long enough to allow its characters to meditate on their shifting realities. That\u2019s one reason it falls short of the top tier of superhero cinema (\u201cThe Dark Knight,\u201d \u201cSuperman II,\u201d \u201cThe Batman,\u201d \u201cGuardians\u201d). I\u2019d characterize the film as next-level good (a roster that includes \u201cIron Man,\u201d \u201cThor,\u201d \u201cBatman Begins,\u201d \u201cCaptain America,\u201d and the hugely underrated \u201cIron Man 3\u201d). Yet watching \u201cSuperman,\u201d we register the layered quality of the conflicts, and we\u2019re drawn right inside them. Gunn constructs an intricate game of a superhero saga that\u2019s arresting and touching, and occasionally exhausting, in equal measure\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter (80)](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/superman-review-david-corenswet-rachel-brosnahan-james-gunn-1236305764/)\n\n&gt;What matters most is that the movie is fun, pacy and enjoyable, a breath of fresh air sweetened by a deep affection for the material and boosted by a winning trio of leads.\n\n[DEADLINE](https://deadline.com/2025/07/superman-review-james-gunn-reboot-1236450641/)\n\n&gt;Overall, Gunn might be trying to do too much here, basically throwing everything against the wall and hoping some of it sticks. More than enough does in this entertaining new direction, but at times\u00a0*Superman*\u00a0suffers from overload, much like Gunns\u2019\u00a0*Guardians of the Galaxy*\u00a0trilogy, which wore out its welcome with Vol. 3 where Rocket unfortunately got the\u00a0*Babe: Pig in the City*\u00a0treatment. Nevertheless he is a talented and skilled director, no question, and one with optimism himself. It will be interesting to see where the future lies for DC under his (and Safran\u2019s) more hopeful vision.\n\n[Indiewire (58)](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/superman-movie-review-james-gunn-1235137386/)\n\n&gt;Gunn is right to recognize that a certain amount of silliness is key to Superman\u2019s charm, but here it mostly just distracts from the seriousness of what\u2019s at stake. It\u2019s hard to make a comic book come to life at the same time as you\u2019re trying to bring life into a comic book, just as it\u2019s hard not to admire Gunn for trying. But it\u2019s even harder to care if a man can fly when there isn\u2019t any gravity to the world around him. Grade: C+\n\n[IGN (8)](https://www.ign.com/articles/superman-2025-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet-rachel-brosnahan-nicholas-hoult)\n\n&gt;Superman is a wonderfully entertaining, heartfelt cinematic reset for the Man of Steel, and a great new start for the DC universe on the big screen.\n\n[The Atlantic (90)](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/07/superman-movie-2025-review/683462/)\n\n&gt;The First Superman Movie Worth Watching in Years. The newest take on the caped hero wisely embraces his corniness.\n\n[Consequence (83)](https://consequence.net/2025/07/superman-review-james-gunn-2025/)\n\n&gt;Grim and gritty are words this movie firmly rejects, instead leaning into the human side of everyone involved, even its villains. There are a few choices that work less well than others, but the end result is a movie that doesn't sacrifice its titular character in service to franchise-building. Instead, it focuses on celebrating the values that Superman himself has embodied from the beginning.\n\n[Collider (80)](https://collider.com/superman-2025-review-james-gunn-dc-david-corenswet/)\n\n&gt;Superman is a magnificent feat, a film that makes the Man of Steel fascinating in a way we\u2019ve rarely seen on film, with a take on the hero that is trenchant, clever, and delightful. Gunn is paying tribute to the past while also making a very clear mark on this world\u2019s future, crafting an introduction to the DCU that inherently makes the viewer want to know where this world goes from here. At this point, it\u2019s rare for superhero films to give a sense of wonder and a reminder of how beautiful these films can be when executed well. But Gunn has brought optimism, hope, and care back to Superman. It ends up becoming one of the best DC films in years, and one of the best movies of the summer.\n\n[The Guardian - UK (2/5)](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jul/08/superman-review-david-corenswet-james-gunn)\n\n&gt;From the very beginning, this new Superman is encumbered by a pointless and cluttered new backstory which has to be explained in many wearisome intertitles flashed up on screen before anything happens at all. Only the repeated and laborious quotation of the great John Williams theme from the 1978 original reminds you of happier times.\n\n[The Wrap (88)](https://www.thewrap.com/superman-2025-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet/)\n\n&gt;A fabulously smart and entertaining film whose flaws stem from trying too hard\u2026 which are the best flaws a film can have.\n\n[Entertainment Weekly (67)](https://ew.com/superman-review-david-corenswet-rachel-brosnahan-soar-kryptonite-script-11768207)\n\n&gt;Whether Gunn fell victim to the kryptonite of excessive studio notes, his desire to populate the film with his stalwart company of actors, or the hubris of not needing to offer reasons to be invested in these characters beyond the mere fact of their existence is unclear. Because there is an unquestionable love for the material and a passion for the goofier, larger-than-life scenarios of comic book lore. With a cast this excellent, there's a capacity for something truly super in a future film \u2014 if only Gunn chooses to put the characters' humanity first.\u00a0**Grade: B-**\n\n[BBC (3/5)](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250708-superman-review)\n\n&gt;It's a shame that Gunn didn't give his story more time to breathe. It's a shame, in particular, that he didn't devote more time to showing us that Superman really is the paragon that his supporters keep saying he is. Corenswet is well cast \u2013 he has plenty of all-American charm both as Superman and as his mild-mannered alter ego, Clark Kent \u2013 but we have to take it on trust that he is a selfless gentleman who helps his friends and enjoys Lois Lane's company. We don't see any of that. Indeed, Corenswet plays him as an oddly hot-headed manchild who can't get through a conversation with his girlfriend without shouting angrily at her. Was Gunn racing through his material so fast that he forgot to put in the scenes that show Superman's sweeter and nobler side? Maybe so. In a film that whirls with flying dogs and bright green baby demons, the most bizarre element is a Man of Steel who keeps having meltdowns.\n\n[Empire Magazine - UK (2/5)](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/superman-2025/)\n\n&gt;David Corenswet takes on the blue-and-red mantle admirably, and glimpses of Gunn\u2019s signature sense of fun shine through \u2014 but a lack of humanity, originality and cohesion means the movie around them just doesn\u2019t work.\n\n[Rolling Stone (80)](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/superman-review-james-gunn-dc-universe-1235374965/)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s faint praise, even in the post-MCU era of the genre, to say that Superman is a solid superhero film; the caveat is hiding in plain sight. What Gunn has pulled off is something more complicated, more interesting, and far tougher: He\u2019s given us a Superman movie that actually feels like a living, breathing comic book.\n\n[SlashFilm (80)](https://www.slashfilm.com/1906722/superman-james-gunn-movie-review/)\n\n&gt;Yes, \"Superman\" is a frequently corny movie because Superman is a corny character, a Kansas farm boy alien who saves squirrels in danger and listens to lame pop music. There's nothing grim or dark here, just a real sense of entertaining silliness that left a big, stupid smile on my face. In our current media landscape, such an approach feels surprisingly bold.\n\n[Independent - UK (4/5)](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/superman-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet-b2782165.html)\n\n&gt;David Corenswet, Rachel Brosnahan and Nicholas Hoult lead a movie that doesn\u2019t just serve as a referendum for superhero films, but for the cinematic future of DC as a whole.\n\n[New York Times (90)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/08/movies/superman-review.html)\n\n&gt;As both a story on its own and a prequel to a whole bunch of others, this movie must introduce us to a variety of characters we\u2019ll meet later, and it does it without feeling too much like fan service or exposition.\n\n[Vulture (90)](https://www.vulture.com/article/review-james-gunns-superman-cant-help-but-be-political.html)\n\n&gt;There\u2019s a lot about how we complicate and obfuscate what should be obvious goods, such as saving the lives of children. But the film\u2019s approach isn\u2019t ham-fisted, and it makes room for gleefully fun stuff, too.\n\n[The Times - UK (2/5)](https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/superman-film-review-david-corenswet-vbzrgpdhh)\n\n&gt;This migraine of a movie is superhero soup. David Corenswet is serviceable as Hollywood\u2019s latest Man of Steel, but director James Gunn has turned the ninth big-screen film into an indigestible mush\n\n[The Irish Times (2/5)](https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/review/2025/07/08/superman-review-utterly-charmless-and-as-funny-as-toothache/)\n\n&gt;The cartoonish closing battles make it clear that, not for the first time, Gunn is striving for high trash, but what he achieves here is low garbage. Utterly charmless. Devoid of humanity. As funny as toothache.\n\n\\---\n\n**SYNOPSIS:**\n\n&gt;Follows Superman as he reconciles his heritage with his human upbringing. He is the embodiment of truth, justice and a brighter tomorrow in a world that views kindness as old-fashioned.\n\n**STARRING**:\n\n* David Corenswet as Clark Kent / Superman\n* Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane\n* Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor\n* Edi Gathegi as Michael Holt / Mister Terrific\n* Anthony Carrigan as Rex Mason / Metamorpho\n* Nathan Fillion as Guy Gardner / Green Lantern\n* Isabela Merced as Kendra Saunders / Hawkgirl\n* Skyler Gisondo as Jimmy Olsen\n* Wendell Pierce as Perry White\n* Beck Bennett as Steve Lombard\n* Mikaela Hoover as Cat Grant\n* Alan Tudyk as Superman Robot #4\n* Sara Sampaio as Eve Teschmacher\n* Mar\u00eda Gabriela de Far\u00eda as Angela Spica / The Engineer\n* Pruitt Taylor Vince as Jonathan 'Pa' Kent\n* Neva Howell as Martha 'Ma' Kent\n\n**DIRECTED BY:** James Gunn\n\n**WRITTEN BY:** James Gunn\n\n**PRODUCED BY:** Peter Safran, James Gunn\n\n**CINEMATOGRAPHY:** Henry Braham\n\n**EDITED BY:** William Hoy, Craig Alpert\n\n**MUSIC BY:** John Murphy, David Fleming\n\n**RELEASE DATE:** July\u00a011,\u00a02025\n\n**RUNTIME:** 2h 9m\n\n**BUDGET:** $225 Million",

        "content": "Okay so I've been on a bit of a Cusack spree lately. Id seen 1408, Gross Point, 2012 etc, but I wanted to watch his older flicks.\n\nSo I watched High Fidelity (which was great) and ~~Don't~~ Say Anything, which was also really good. Next up was this one, Better off Dead. Which I thought would be another romcom.\n\nBro, what was this movie. It was unhinged in an incredible way, from the Airplane style jokes to the relentless paper boys, to the \"testicles all over me\". \n\nI'm pretty sure Lane killed at least like 3 people in this movie lol, and what was with the skiing obsession?! \n\nI need to look into the making/background of this movie because yeah wow, what the heck was that. And of course, endlessly quotable...\n\nEdit: while folks are commenting, any other Cusack recommendations? I'm definitely watching \"One Crazy Summer\", but I'm open to pretty much anything he's in that's also a good movie lol",

        "content": "I think I've seen most of the mainstream spy movies, and as far as the novels go I'm a fan of Trevanian, Ian Fleming, John Le Carre, And other masters of the genre. The thing is, is it's really hard to find a good spy movie that I haven't seen that was made after 2000. \nA lot of them just look nearly as badly thought out as \"made-for-television\" movies, not to speak badly of made for television movies, but they just lack a certain adult theme and intellectual quality that makes the great spy movies.\n\nSo I'm thinking that maybe some of you with your excellent tastes, who have never steered me wrong, can recommend some excellent intrigue/spy/political drama movies, that were made after 2000? I also like some historical intrigue, like,\"\"Britannia\" which felt like a combination of a suspense and intrigue movie combined with action and historical reference.\nDoesn't have to be in English, I don't mind reading subtitles see if it's good.\nThanks!",

        "content": "This movie is billed as being a daring romance with elements of espionage - set during the resistance in Berlin during the Second World War. \n\nIt is not. \n\nSpoilers -\nWhile it is a very topical movie with a timely message, it is an extraordinarily depressing tale of one woman\u2019s existence in Nazi prisons while she raises a baby while waiting the death penalty. Her romance with her husband is shown in flashbacks, but there is no chemistry between the leads and after he is executed, she just stoically gets on with it. Therefore, no romance. The espionage bit is basically just them typing in morse code, trying to reach the Soviets, but in the end their radio was too weak to send but a single message.  No thrilling espionage.\n\nWhile it is pretty clear what Hilde\u2019s fate is going to be, it is shown very starkly. \n\nI can\u2019t really say I enjoyed it. It is very scary, because people were given the death penalty for basically putting up stickers over Nazi propaganda and listening to a certain radio programme. It isn\u2019t too much of a stretch to see that pattern repeating itself. \n\nTLDR: good movie, but definitely NOT for a date and not what it says on the tin. ",

Yesterday was the second day with Bahrain. Today is Bangladesh. \n\nOur second day winner, from Bahrain, is **Hamad and the Pirates (1971) directed by Richard Lyford.** I know nothing about this movie other than it apparently is a Disney movie, yet sadly not on Disney Plus. It is not on 1337x. If anyone has access on how to view it, feel free to comment. \n\nOkay let's do **Bangladesh.**\n\nIt's a little country east of India that oftentimes lingers in India's shadow. So let's let this beautiful country stand on its own today in film!\n\nThe rules:\n\nI) It's not important if the movie was made in the given country, but it *has* to be set there (e.g. the movie can be set in Paris, but hasn't to be a french movie after all). Mainstream American made movies are totally okay, but let's always try to prioritize movies with the native language, if possible. If a movie is split between a few locations I\u2019m looking for where it\u2019s rooted.\n\nII) Animated movies are okay but not documentaries.\n\nIII) On ties I'll just pick the movie with less reviews on imdb to spotlight the lesser known films.\n\nIV) After 24 hours, whatever movie comment gets the most upvotes, wins. make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment.\n\nDay 2: Bahrain- Hamad and the Pirates (1971) directed by Richard Lyford\n\nDay 1: Afghanistan- Osama (2004) directed by Siddiq Barmak",

Honest, hard worker, a bit too flashy with the outfits, but a solid backup man with a good mind.\n\nGun: I'm a plain kind of guy who wants something reliable, not too flashy, and with a story behind it. John Ryder's (Rutger Hauer's) S&amp;W Model 28 from \"The Hitcher\" fits the bill perfectly. \n\nCar: So many to choose from, but my heart always goes back to my love for the white 1985 Ferrari Testarossa from Miami Vice.

Award Winner - One Must Be a film for which the actor received an Awards nomination, be it Academy Awards or Golden Globes\n\n2. Box Office Smash \u2013 Need to have Made 200 Million at the Box Office \n\n3. Two Hander \u2013 A movie where the actor stars opposite another major movie star\n\n4. Auteur Turn \u2013 A movie where the actor works with an Auteur Director \n\n5. Comedy \u2013 Every serious Actor of the last 40 years \u2013 This doesn\u2019t mean the movie itself necessarily is a comedy, but the Actor has to give a comedic performance, intentionally or not. \n\n6. Bit Part \u2013 This Can be either a brief cameo appearance in the movie or an appearance as part of a larger ensemble\n\n7. Flop \u2013 Even our biggest stars have a few flops interspersed throughout their careers and Hackman is so different \u2013 the key to this category is choosing a FLOP that is still somehow watchable\n \n8. Wild Cards- Dealer's choice\n\n9.

        "title": "Which actors do you only ever see as themselves, and which completely disappear into their roles?",
        "content": "Had a chat with my fam about this the other night while watching a film. For whatever reason, with some actors, no matter what film I\u2019m watching with them in it, I don\u2019t see the character, I just see the actor.\n\n\nSometimes it\u2019s because they basically play themselves every time, or they\u2019re typecast into the same type of role over and over. Other times it\u2019s just their massive star power overshadowing the entire film.\n\n\nFor example, Marilyn Monroe - one of the earliest examples of this. Hell yeah, she was a great actress, but in every film, all I see is Marilyn. I can never even remember her characters\u2019 names because it\u2019s just her.\n\n\nPerfect example: Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson...he\u2019s been playing himself since the mid-2000s. imo Jack Black too. Jeff Goldblum feels like he\u2019s parodying himself these days. And as much as I love Bruce Willis (\ud83d\ude22) after Die Hard, 90% of his roles felt like slight variations of a cavalier John McClane. Pacino too - after Scent of a Woman, all I see is Pacino being Pacino. Watching Tom Cruise in a movie these days feels like Tom Cruise doing cool Tom Cruise things, and as hilarious as I find Ryan Reynolds, Deadpool is basically Van Wilder in a suit. I don't mean to bash on any of them at all, I've enjoyed every single one, i just thought it interesting to point out. \n\n\nBut then you've got absolute superstars like DiCaprio, one of the most recognizable faces on the planet, yet when I watch his movies, I don\u2019t see Leo, I see his characters. Same with guys like Daniel Day-Lewis, Gary Oldman, and Christian Bale, who completely vanish into whoever they\u2019re playing.\n\n\nFunny enough, Johnny Depp used to be on that list for me. the king of vanishing into a role. But now, even though he looks nothing like himself under all that makeup, i'm still sitting there in the theatre like: \u201cyep, that\u2019s Johnny Depp doing his thing.\u201d\n\n\nNicolas Cage is the wildcard. Sometimes I can\u2019t get past that it\u2019s just Nic Cage being Nic Cage, other times his performance is so phenomenal I completely forget it\u2019s him...or maybe because it\u2019s actually John Travolta, playing Nic Cage, playing John Travolta\u2026\n\n\nWhat about you guys? Which actors can you never unsee, and which ones completely vanish into their characters for you?",
