Arthur Christmas is a 2011 animated Christmas film produced by Aardman Animations. It focuses on Arthur, the clumsy but well-meaning son of Santa Claus, who works in the high-tech North Pole operation that delivers presents worldwide. In the film, Santa\u2019s modern, gadget-filled sleigh and sophisticated delivery system make the process of gift-giving appear efficient and flawless.\n\nHowever, a mix-up occurs when one child is accidentally missed on Christmas Eve. While Santa and his older son Steve (who runs the operation) don\u2019t see it as a big deal, Arthur is determined to make sure every child receives their gift. With the help of his Grandsanta (Santa\u2019s father, who is old-fashioned) and a team of elves, Arthur embarks on an adventurous mission to deliver the last present in time.\n\nThe movie emphasizes the themes of family, the spirit of Christmas, and the importance of doing the right thing, even if it seems difficult. It\u2019s a heartwarming, humorous tale about overcoming challenges and keeping the magic of Christmas alive.",

It\u2019s one of the few movies where I genuinely needed a moment of silence after the credits rolled. The sheer hopelessness and irony of the final scene make it unforgettable\u2014and so divisive.\n\nWhat gets me is how the movie perfectly builds the tension and despair, only to deliver an ending that\u2019s so bleak, it almost feels cruel. But that\u2019s what makes it stand out. Love it or hate it, you have to admit it takes guts to go there.\n\nIt\u2019s one of those films that sticks with you, whether you want it to or not.",

        "content": "The 1988 classic die hard features a wide array of 13 (13 not 12, 13) villains for Bruce Willis to take out but how do they rank aganist each other\n\n13 - Heinrich - he is incharge of - spoiler - putting the C4 on the top of the building and is killed in a fairly boring way by McClane, plus he has no screentime so, here he goes\n\n12 - Alexander - he is the ordinarg looking missle guy who blew up the SWAT RV.\n\n11 - Kristof - does absolutley nothing but he does get the honour of being spared by McClane and being one of two terrorists to survive the night. He is Theo's assistant\n\n10 - Fritiz is Karls long-haired bodygaurd. He appears a bit throughout the movie and is killed when McClane fires wildly into the lift. \n\n9 - Tony - Karls brother places low because the action scene he dies in is the worst in the movie\n\n8 - James - he is the strong missle guy, he is Alexanders assistant, he along with Alexander are killed when McClane blow them up.\n\n7. Franco - getting shot in the kneecaps and landing on glass got him here\n\n6. Marco - \"next time you have the chance to kill someone, don't hessitate\" shoots him \"thanks for the advice.\" This is one of my favourite action scene in the movie and the franchise. such a fun sequence from the shoot out to the police car escaping the gunfire from the other terrorists. Very cool, very fun. Not sure who shot at the car so i am mentioning it here.\n\n5. Uli - he is the person who loves chocolate so much he eats some when preparing for a shootout.\n\n4. Eddie - all right, its just the main 4 left (A.K.A the ones with any plot relevance) so we know the ranking but lets continue anyway. Eddie is pretending to be the secetary for the first half of the movie, hangs around by the vault for the second and has a laugh off with Hans and McClane before he is shot in the head. His actor does a good job, the slight akwardness with the laugh is good, everything is good... but everything can be even more good.\n\n3. Theo - he is the 2nd terrorist to survive the events that took place in nakatomi plaza on christmas eve 1988. It would of been cool if they acknowleged they're survival. Anyway he is pretty darn great, but he has little screentime and like Hans and Eddie, isn't very physical as he never fights McClane.\n\n2. Karl - finally the proper good stuff. Karl is so fun. The way his only goal is to kill McClane, for killing his brother. I mean they didn't need to add that to the movie but they did and his actor gives a pretty good performance, plus his fight with McClane is cool, double plus the way he could get away but doesn't want McClane to survive is pretty cool too. \n\n1. Hans Gruber - go read an article on why he works as a villain, that exists. In short, he is perfect. Top five villains of all time.\n\n\n",

        "content": "I watched this movie for the first time today. I was surprised by how good it looks. It's 14 years old and the lighting is still on point. The animations also leave nothing to be desired. The colours are wonderfully chosen. Only some minor daylight sequences can't hide a bit of well worn dust.\n\nWhat also surprised me about the movie was its ending. The main character wins a lot. But he is also losing a leg? I think that could cause some interesting dialogues with kids, right?\n\nRegarding the remake: even with the relatively decent trailer released some time ago, I have problems seeing that work out. The colours. The stilistic choices. The final battle. How are they gonna translate this into a realistic environment?\n\nWe will see. What's left so far is watching the next two movies. ",

        "content": "I appreciate the 007 story and want to see good James Bond movies arrive.\n\nBut spying is not the same game it was in the 20th Century, and the stories we are getting are increasingly bizarre and implausible, and it just doesn\u2019t work to shoehorn 007 into the current year.\n\nSo let\u2019s bring 007 not only back to the beginning, but let\u2019s start him as a brand new British spy during World War II, behind the front lines. There could be an entire trilogy of material just set in WWII, and we could see Felix as a brand new OSS agent.\n\nThe story has a defined enemy: Nazis. And a megalomaniac: Hitler. But to avoid counterfactualism, 007 should do a realistic intelligence gathering mission in Lisbon and occupied Paris. (Maybe he is tasked with something small but thinks he has a chance at assassinating Hitler and tries but misses and has to escape.)\n\nThen, there\u2019s the whole second half of the 1940s to mine for good stories. The point of this post is that I think we\u2019re hitting our heads against the wall trying to make a 21st century story about a 20th century character. So reboot the series and put 007 back to the beginning: his first op in WWII.",

        "title": "Few directors have ever had a streak of top notch films like Rob Reiner did for the first decade of his film directing career. And few have ever had that streak end so spectacularly with the likes of \"North.\"",
        "content": "Seriously, these are the first seven films Reiner directed:\n\n1984: \"This is Spinal Tap\"\n\n1985: \"The Sure Thing\"\n\n1986: \"Stand By Me\n\n1987: \"The Princess Bride\"\n\n1989: \"When Harry Met Sally\"\n\n1990: \"Misery\"\n\n1992: \"A Few Good Men\"\n\nThat is an INSANE streak of excellent films, several of which are classics. The least of them is probably \"The Sure Thing\" and that's a charming, funny 80s teen spin on \"It Happened One Night\" that made John Cusack a leading man. And especially impressive is how diverse they are, ranging from the best music mockumentary ever to one of the greatest coming of age films ever to a gold standard romantic coming of age film to one of the most beloved fantasy/family films of all time. Reiner really seemed like he could do no wrong...\n\n...and then he made \"North\" and that streak ended in a crashing halt that promptly exploded. \"North\" was the kind of disaster made by a director on an insane hot streak who thought he could not miss and thus had a blank check to make his pet project which he clearly thought was going to be a modern \"Wizard of Oz.\" Instead, it became a massive bomb that is now best known for being the subject of one of Siskel and Ebert's greatest reviews. And regrettably, Reiner's never been the same as a director since. (He did rebound with \"The American President\" as his next film, but Aaron Sorkin was much more the driving creative force on that one and his directing career since has been scattershot at best.) But at least he'll always have that awesome directoral decade to look back on with well-deserved pride.",

I absolutely love this story, it's super interesting and done really well. Characters (and actors) are great. It has some kind of an old school touch. Nice and warm sci-fi feeling in the vein of a classics such as Ray Bradbury, Simak, PKD and a tv show Quantum Leap, of course. But I have one tiny question: Colter ends up in Sean Fentress's body. Did Sean disappear from the  existence? He was such a nice guy",

Vince Lombardi High School keeps losing principals to nervous breakdowns because of the students' love of rock 'n' roll and their disregard for education. The leader of the students, Riff Randell (P.J. Soles), is the biggest Ramones fan at the school and also the worst behavioral problem. When the new principal of the school Principal Togar (Mary Woronov) shows her hatred of The Ramones the students start to take over the school. If you are a fan of The Ramones this film is worth checking out. Also aside from The Ramones music the film does have a great soundtrack.",

Of course it\u2019s nowhere near as good as the original but I thought it was cool to see these characters interact again after all these years and I love the addition of Kathy Bates who I thought was hilarious in this one. I still love the interactions between Willie and Thurman although of course it\u2019s not gonna hit quite the same notes as the first time around due to the actor who plays Thurman is much older this time around. I feel that with all the comedy movies that got sequel\u2019s a significant time after the original was released that have fallen flat (Zoolander being the perfect example of this). I found Bad Santa 2 to be quite enjoyable and fun, although I know this opinion might be more in the minority given its ratings and reviews online, it seemed not to do very well, perhaps my expectations were just quite low. What do you guys think of it? ",
