The necklace was far too recognizable. Had she tried to sell it, the insurance company that settled the claim would have recovered it, assuming that the insurance company was still in business.\n\n============\n\nEDIT: Regarding the points above, from the script:\n\nLOVETT: I tracked it down through insurance  records... an old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?\n\nROSE: Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.\n\nLOVETT: Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace his son Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee... you... a week before he sailed on Titanic. And the claim was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship. See the date?\n\nLIZZY: April 14, 1912.\n\nLOVETT: If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank. And that makes you my new best friend.",

Did you like it or dislike it?\n\nTo be honest, I'm a bit bewildered by it all. This movie really threw my emotions for a loop; there were moments that made me laugh, while others left me feeling frustrated. I found myself scratching my head because I\u2019m torn about whether I actually liked it or not. Perhaps it was the way it ended, or maybe I just wanted more closure. I was left wanting to know what would happen next, and that lack of clarity didn\u2019t sit well with me.",
