I've already put a reserve for 100 tickets (first come first serve) to redditors everywhere.\n\nIf you're in NYC and want to come watch this very special IMAX release + Q&amp;A,\n\njust RSVP: by sending \u201cr/movies + Yourname\u201d to\u00a0[ainsleymcgovern@falcoink.com](mailto:ainsleymcgovern@falcoink.com)",

It was a prison story, a kind which I hadn't actually tried before. The story started simple but the characters clicked with me instantly.\n\nI liked most of them.\n\nThe movie is slow, but in a good way. It doesn't rush important moments. The characters feel real, especially the friendship between Andy and Red. That's honestly the best part of the movie for me.\n\nThe moving didn't have flashy actions scenes and stuff but it still touched me, the ending was amazing and I stared at the end credits for a solid minute or two after it ended.\n\nSo for me it would be an easy 10/10",

        "title": "What film deserves a tell-all documentary?",
        "content": "I\u2019ve seen This Is The End loads recently on my Reddit feed for some reason - probably the algorithm because I\u2019ve rewatched it recently - and I have SO MANY questions around this existence of this film. Seth Rogen looks twitchy as hell every time it\u2019s mentioned in interviews, Emma Watson walked off set, Danny McBride has mentioned competitive one-upping and the Jay Baruchel and Jonah Hill dislike is fascinating too, like was it a personality clash or something deeper?\n\nAlso culturally it felt like the last of an era of very male, very Apatow-y comedy movies that dominated the 2000s and early 2010s. I\u2019m not sure whether that\u2019s a good or bad thing, suppose that\u2019s for discussion.\n\nI would kill for a tell-all documentary with the actors and people behind it behind all of the drama and to justify its existence, but what else deserves the treatment?",

        "content": "Sometimes it is not the whole movie. It is one scene. One look. One line reading. And you just know this person can act.\n\nFor me it is Ben Foster in 3:10 to Yuma. The campfire talk with Russell Crowe. He is calm, but you can feel how dangerous he is. Half the tension is just on his face.\n\nAlso Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense. The car scene with Toni Collette when he finally opens up. It feels raw and real, like a kid finally telling the truth he has been holding in for years.\n\nWhat is your pick? Name the movie and the exact scene that sold you.\n\nThank you.",

It\u2019s from a movie that deserves a bit more praise than it gets, unexpectedly dropping the hardest line of all time. From Sonic the Hedgehog 2:\n\n\u201cDo I look like I need YOUR power?\u201d",
