        "title": "The T-Rex in Jurassic Park is the Greatest Special Effect Ever - And I'm not Talking About the CGI One",
        "content": "So, *Jurassic Park* is a very important movie to me. I'm in my early thirties, and I've grown up watching this movie, as well as it's first two sequels (I'm admittedly not a fan of the *World* sequels). I've seen it more than any other movie by far, and it never ceases to amaze me. When I was a kid in the 90's, entering the Jurassic Park section at Universal Studios in Florida was a magical experience as they perfectly re-captured the feeling of entering the park from the movie. The music still gives me goosebumps every time I hear it. My favorite dinosaur? It's got to be the T-Rex. And I truly believe it's the greatest special effect that was ever in a movie, or ever will be. And I'm not talking about the CGI one - despite being a ground breaking achievement, it doesn't hold a candle to the life sized animatronic Stan Winston Studios created for the movie.\n\nUnfortunately, over the years, I feel like the life sized animatronic T-Rex has been overshadowed by the CGI one. Sure, it a huge step in a totally new form of digital effects. And sure, 30 years later and it still manages to hold up due to Spielberg's restraint and cleaver usage of the medium. But having an actual 30 foot tall [T-Rex sized robot that looks and moves as realistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFTsYGgdR9k&amp;t=59s) as it did is just jaw dropping. I'm currently watching the Industrial Light &amp; Magic docuseries on Disney+ and they, along with everyone else in other similar videos discussing the cultural impact of the film, always highlight the CGI effects and don't seem to spend as much time discussing how incredible the practical effects were. \n\nDuring quarantine, I was lucky enough to interview Stan Winston's son Matthew Winston regarding his father's legacy. He told me how he was present on set for multiple movies his father worked on, and got to be up close and personal with Aliens, Predators, Terminators, Pumpkinheads and everything in between, but nothing was as incredible and surrealistic as seeing the T-Rex in all it's glory. I could only imagine how mystifying that would have been.\n\nThey went even bigger with *The Lost World* by having two T-Rexes. Say what you will about that movie, but they absolutely devoured every scene they were in (sharing a bite with each other is one of the coolest deaths in the series). While the third movie continued the practical dinos, the modern trilogy either seemed to lean fully into CGI (which is already dated) or used practical effects that were somehow less effective than ones used decades prior. \n\nHow do you feel about the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park? Have they left a huge impression on you? Do you think any special effect has come close? I personally think Gollum in LOTR would be the most noteworthy, and I also think the practical effects, costumes, set design, etc in that trilogy is phenomenal as well. ",

The screenplay by Ken Nolan and Gary Spinelli tries its best to avoid the cliches of the overworked spy genre and manages to help create a worthy character for Malek to run with, maybe not as fast as Jason Bourne, but no less memorable.\n\n[Variety - Owen Gleiberman](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/the-amateur-review-rami-malek-1236362272/)\n\n&gt;This is the third thriller that Rami Malek has made since becoming a star in \u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d and it nudges his tense, twitchy moodiness even closer to the center of his brand. He\u2019s the right actor to play a digital geek turned mindhunter; those eyes of his glare like lasers. Mostly, though, Malek plays out his methodical mission of vengeance as if it were something almost theoretical. The conceit of \u201cThe Amateur\u201d \u2014 that Charlie must do all this himself \u2014 remains, at heart, a conceit. That\u2019s why the movie is okay but never, you know, killer.\n\n[Guardian](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/205) \\- [Peter Bradshaw](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/peter-bradshaw) \\- 2/5\n\n&gt;There is a fundamental problem concerning how ruthless Charles is supposed to be in killing his wife\u2019s murderers in cold blood and the final confrontation with the homicidal mastermind involves a very muddled exchange of views.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/213) \\- [David Rooney](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/david-rooney)\n\n&gt;It at least looks and feels like a real movie. That might sound like not much of a distinction. But in this age of assembly-line streaming originals that play like bland knockoffs of a dozen multiplex hits you\u2019ve seen before, it\u2019s not nothing, either.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/226) \\- [David Ehrlich](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/david-ehrlich) \\- C+\n\n&gt;An aggressively competent spy thriller that has less use for logic than its lead actor does for his smile... the film makes a compelling enough case to sustain itself across the entire television season\u2019s worth of plot that it packs into two hours.\n\n[awakeinthedark - Brent Leuthold](https://awakeinthedark.com/2025/04/the-amateur/) \\- 2.5/5\n\n&gt;*The Amateur* isn\u2019t a bad movie from a technical perspective. Despite some misjudged shaky cam, it\u2019s well-shot and edited in a way that makes its 2-hour runtime move along briskly. It\u2019s just not a film that distinguishes itself enough from other revenge or spy films we\u2019ve seen already. Its release comes just a few weeks after *Black Bag*, already one of the year\u2019s best, which also follows spies chasing spies but does so with much more panache and thematic heft.",

I thought she was a good actress but men were mesmerized by her body and iconic lips. She then did Weird Science, playing a virtual woman, created by two geeks, and that film became a instant cult classic. In the 80s, she was the perfect woman. \n\nSo what happened? Two words: Steven Seagal. She married the famed martial arts movie star, after working together in Hard to Kill, and the troubled marriage lasted 9 years. \n\nShe barely acted but while her film career went up in flames, she did turn to a good cause, helping the Terminally ill by being a spokesperson for Club Carson, a foundation helping children with cancer. \n\nA good woman, her film career didn't rise to the potential she had, but she has used her fame for a worthy cause and this is what matters the most. \n\nAnd she's still stunning.",

Are there any vampire-themed films that you love the plot of - I get people are gonna say Blade and stuff, but that's cool....I discovered He Never Died, and thought that was quite interesting, for example - I'm also looking forward to trying Sinners :) but any recommendations would be welcome. Thank you very much!! :)",

        "title": "April 4-6 Box Office Recap: 'A Minecraft Movie' massively over-performs, debuting with a colossal $162.7 million domestically. Worldwide, it earned $313.4 million, the second biggest debut for a video game movie.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/3kitircrohte1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92e79a33892ca9682412307a2d502234da9c8839\n\nAfter some very weak months, the box office finally picked up steam with April.\n\nAnd that's practically all because of ***A Minecraft Movie***, which overcame months of negative buzz to deliver a record opening weekend for a video game adaptation, as well as the biggest debut of the year.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $190.8 million this weekend. That's up a massive 135.3% from last year, when ***Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire*** stayed on top, while ***Monkey Man*** and ***The First Omen*** underwhelmed.\n\nDebuting atop, WB's ***A Minecraft Movie*** surpassed all expectations, earning a colossal $162.7 million in 4,263 theaters. That's even bigger than WB's ***Barbie*** ($162 million), and it's only behind ***Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2*** ($169 million) for the studio's biggest debut. The opening is also higher than the previous video game record, ***The Super Mario Bros. Movie*** ($146 million), although ***Mario*** debuted on a Wednesday and burned off demand.\n\nSimply put, it's a fantastic film. Especially after months of negative buzz surrounding the film's trailers. And a much needed win for WB after a slate of disappointing performers like ***Joker***, ***War of the Rohirrim***, ***Companion*** and ***The Alto Knights***.\n\nBack in September 2024, when the teaser trailer debuted, the film earned poor reception, with many criticizing the VFX. To win over audiences for the other trailers, studio marketing suits added more VFX and quelled rabid fans by conveying that their Minecraft will stay true to the game. But that's perhaps the key; people will talk badly about a product, but that buzz translates into awareness, which builds into curiosity.\n\nOf course, not all negative buzz translates into curiosity (***Snow White*** waving in the distance). But the advantage for this film is simply ***Minecraft***. Despite the belief that the game lost relevance years ago, the stats say otherwise; ***Minecraft*** is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 300 million copies sold and nearly 170 million monthly active players as of 2024. Clearly, there's already an audience awaiting for a film, and they happily paid tickets for this. Even lukewarm reviews (48% on RT) didn't dissuade fans from checking it out.\n\nAccording to Warner Bros., 67% of the audience was male, and 78% was under 25 years old. They gave it a middling \"B+\" on CinemaScore, which is very mediocre for a family film. While word of mouth among children is very positive, adults are less thrilled with the film. We'll see in subsequent weeks how much it drops, but for now, a $450 million domestic total is in the cards for ***A Minecraft Movie***.\n\nLast week's champ ***A Working Man*** added $7.3 million this weekend. That's a 53% drop, which is slightly worse than ***Beekeeper***'s 48% drop. Of course, that film had incredibly weak competition, but it's a sign that the film might not be able to leg out as hoped. Through 10 days, the film has amassed $27.8 million, and it should finish with around $40 million domestically.\n\nIn third place, ***The Chosen: Last Supper \u2014 Part 2*** earned $6.9 million this weekend. That's down 42% from ***Part 1***'s performance last week. Let's see how ***Part 3*** fares this weekend.\n\nWith the arrival of a big blockbuster, ***Snow White*** had another terrible drop this weekend. It fell a rough 59%, earning just $5.9 million this weekend. The film's legs appear to be running out. Through 17 days, the film has earned a terrible $77.3 million and it's gonna finish with less than $90 million domestically. That's absolutely pathetic.\n\nBlumhouse's ***The Woman in the Yard*** added $4.5 million this weekend. That's a 52% drop, which isn't that bad considering the film's poor word of mouth. Through 10 days, the film has earned $16.6 million, and it should pass $20 million by next week.\n\n***Death of a Unicorn*** earned $2.6 million this weekend. That's a 53% drop, which is quite rough for a comedy. Through 10 days, the film has earned just $10.7 million and it will struggle to get to $15 million by the end of its run.\n\nWith the arrival of ***Part 2***, ***The Chosen: Last Supper \u2014 Part 1*** collapsed a horrible 84% this weekend, earning just $1.8 million. That took its domestic lifetime to $17.9 million after 10 days.\n\nThere was another wide release this weekend, Neon's ***Hell of a Summer***. Debuting in 1,255 theaters, it earned an okay $1.7 million. With weak word of mouth and horror/thriller competition on the way, it's gonna disappear quickly from theaters.\n\nIn ninth place, Bleecker Street's ***The Friend*** expanded to 1,237 theaters and earned $1.6 million this weekend.\n\nRounding up the Top 10 was ***Captain America: Brave New World***, which fell 54% and added $1.3 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $199 million and it will crack the $200 million milestone sometime this week.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***A Minecraft Movie*** also took over the rest of the world. The film earned a huge $150.7 million overseas, for a $313.4 million worldwide debut. That's the second biggest debut for a video game movie, behind ***Mario***. The best debuts were in the UK ($19.9M), China ($14.5M), Mexico ($11.2M), Germany ($10.6M) and Australia ($8.3M). It still has other markets left, including Japan. We'll see if the film can be strong enough to hit the $1 billion mark.\n\n***Snow White*** is running out of steam and it's already its third week. It added just $9 million overseas, which takes its worldwide total to a terrible $168.6 million.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nNone.\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nWe're getting FOUR wide releases, and none stand a chance in dethroning ***Minecraft***.\n\nThe first is 20th Century Studios' ***The Amateur***, which stars Rami Malek as a CIA cryptographer who seeks revenge against his wife's killers. With ***A Working Man*** slowing down, this could be a main attraction for old-school action fans.\n\nAnother release is Universal/Blumhouse's ***Drop***, which stars Meghann Fahy as a widow who is contacted by a stranger to kill her date, or her family will be murdered. The film already premiered at SXSW and it has received strong reviews (89% on RT). Can it be the hit that Blumhouse wants and needs?\n\nAnother is A24's ***Warfare***, which follows in real-time a platoon of Navy SEALs on a mission through insurgent territory in 2006. It's directed by both Ray Mendoza and Alex Garland (although the latter states his role is more secondary), and it has earned great reviews so far (93% on RT). It's unreasonable to expect numbers similar to ***Civil War***, but perhaps it could be a surprise breakout for A24.\n\nAnd finally, there's Angel Studios' ***The King of Kings***, an animated film about the life of Jesus Christ. Angel Studios has delivered a big marketing for the film, and pre-sales are reportedly strong here. Maybe it could surprise.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",
