What's more, I think they basically got it right about what happens after you die, which is pretty much in line with the Buddhist and Hindu beliefs in karma and reincarnation. However, I'd say the movie embraces too many superficial yuppie values from the 80s, with very little focus on how your actions affect others, not just yourself. What about the 30 or so people he accidentally killed on the bus? Shouldn't he have been punished for their deaths? And I think there's much more involved during the interim period between lifetimes than looking at a few critical days of your life to see what lessons you learned from them, in particular pertaining to dealing with fear. Sure, we all need to learn to deal with fear, which is a very big part of growth, but I think we need to learn a lot more lessons than just this, in particular, being responsible for the consequences of our actions, intentional or not, though intent carries a great deal more weight. In any case, these are just some of my thoughts, and I'm curious to know some of yours as well.",

        "content": "What's up with these AI Ghibli pics recently? Wherever I go, I just cannot escape it. Being a guy who loves the cinematic art in any form, seeing this trend getting this scale of traction is simply sad. I have profound respect for the studio and I  was amazed by their work when I discovered movies like Castle in The Sky, Grave of the Fireflies, Spirited away, etc. And when I got to know how these movies are made and how much manual effort it takes to produce them, my appreciation only increased. But here comes some AI tool that can replicate this in a matter of minutes. This is no less than a slap on the faces of artists who spend hours imagining and creating something like this. \n\nI am not against AI, or advancements it is making. But there must be a limit to this. You can cut a fruit as well as stab someone with a kitchen knife. Right now, it is the latter happening with the use of AI tools just for cheap social media points. Sad state of affairs.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you guys like his trend? ",

Then when it was over they'd stay, watch the opening cartoons, then watch the feature film up to the point they arrived.  My mom and I tease him about this and say surely it was never really a thing but he swears that's the way it was done back then.  Anyone heard of or experienced this? ",

After watching him in Season 3 of True Detective, I really wanted to see  more of him. I enjoyed his short-lived show Deputy afterwards as well. I'd like to see more, but a lot of his catalog seems so cheesy, I don't want to waste my time watching them. I feel like he could be acting in a lot higher caliber of movies. He's an actor I'd love to have if I was directing a gritty crime thriller or western.\n\nAnyone else?",

        "content": "The first scene of pro Baseketball, we see Coop blow the Denslow Cup. He gets psyched out so bad that he falls forward, and barely makes it in the direction of the rim. Squeak made his shot right before to bring Coop to the plate with a chance to walk off Denslow Cup 4. \n\nSqueak gets roasted nonstop the entire movie. He cannot be psyched out. He gets more fucked up shit said to him than anyone by far. He lives and plays with the best psych-out artists in the league. On the surface he seems like a nervous wreck, but he's the most clutch shooter on the team. He also psychs out Tuttle to beat the LA Riots to clinch a playoff spot.\n\nSqueak always protects Joey's heroic image of Coop, even though Coop is a complete asshole to him. It's all about the kid. He tells Joey that Coop is a major dude, while not pursuing the girl at the bar. Coop falls asleep at the plate, throws the 3rd homerun over the garage, and almost kills Joey at the hospital. Before that, Coop and Remer spend Joey's whole day with the team fighting over Jenna. \n\nSqueak is a leader. With Denslow Cup 5 slipping away and the team getting blown out, It is Squeak who rallies the team on the Mulakalaka balance board of trust, while dressed as a pineapple. Remer doesn't even try, while Coop merely sucks until then. Once again, Squeak never misses. In fact, the only shot Squeak misses the entire movie is when he's not even playing, and doesn't know the rules yet.\n\nSqueak puts himself in scoring position in the Denslow Cup 5 game so many times, he collapses from running the bases. He then scores the tying run on the game winning shot. Only then, with the championship won, does Squeak engage with the girl from the bar.\n\nCoop is overwhelmed and out of his element as the player/owner. He gets distracted with the ownership of the team on the line by chasing Jenna instead of maintaining the Beers franchise and trying to make the playoffs. He flies to Calcutta to deal with his clothing line scandal and barely makes it back in time for the big game.\n\nRemer is the team cancer. When he doesn't get his way, he pouts. He cares way more about money and status than winning. He actively colludes with the Dallas owner to begin turning the league into everything it was meant not to be. He basically gives up on the team on anal-probe night, dragging the rest of the team down. Only Squeak isn't pissed off about not controlling the team they aren't the owner of.\n\nSqueak \"Little Bitch\" Scholari. MVP of the Milwaukee Beers, and Denslow Cup champion.",
