A spunky, young girl whom Rosso takes under his wing and she tries to understand who he is. Miyazaki always had a great knack for female protagonists.\n\nAnd this movie has my favorite Joe Hisaishi original score for a Miyazaki movie. For years, I've been trying to find the piece which scores the flashback scene of young Rosso flying with young Gina. I've never found it. If you know the title, please tell me. I'd be grateful.",

        "title": "Wasn't the biggest fan of The Whale, but I'm shocked at the number of people who don't seem to understand Charlie's character at all",
        "content": "So many people hate him because they say it was selfish for him to eat himself to death with his daughter back in his life, and if he really loved her, he would try to get better.\n\nBut the point of the movie isn't to be some big redemption story for Charlie.  He binge eats because he's essentially given up on himself due to a combination of guilt and self loathing.  He abandoned his family and failed his lover.  Every day he's alive reminds him of what a piece of shit he feels he is.  When you're that deep in the hole, it's not so easy to just pick yourself up and try to get better.  You don't feel like you deserve it.  In his mind, he deserves to die, and the only thing about him that's worth giving to his daughter is his money.\n\nSo he saves money for his daughter as a way for him to justify his continued existence, and he doesn't really believe he deserves to be part of her life, so he keeps his distance.\n\nWhen he finally does contact her, I don't think it's really a rational decision.  He still feels like he doesn't deserve to be in her life, but he knows he's dying, and he can't stomach the idea of leaving the world without having some kind of relationship with her, so he ends up kind of sheepishly trying to re-insert himself into her life to some degree.  I don't think he ever tries to squeeze forgiveness out of her.  He just doesn't want to go to his grave knowing she hates him and that he didn't try to do something right for her before the end.\n\nIt's a lot of conflicting emotions and decision-making from a highly flawed human being who doesn't really want to live anymore, but is still trying to \"something\" right with the time he's got left.  Him giving his daughter the money doesn't make up for what he took from her, and that's not really what he's trying to do anyway.  It's all he's really capable of giving her at this point, and he doesn't want to die knowing he did nothing for her at all.\n\nPeople saying that he should've just stopped eating clearly don't understand why he's eating.  It's not because he loves food.  It's because he hates himself.  He doesn't feel like he deserves to live, but he's also still afraid of death.  The base human instinct to continue living is extremely strong.  Anyone who's been severely depressed and suicidal but still can't stop themselves for going about their daily routine can tell you that.  So he eats to numb the pain, and once he realizes it's killing him, he sees it as a just punishment for his failings as a person and allows it to continue happening.\n\nI can understand not empathizing that much with Charlie to some degree, but the people who see his refusal to get well as actively malicious and selfish on his part don't really understand what it's like to be truly depressed to that degree.  You might as well be telling a suicidal person to just \"suck it up\" or a depressed person to just \"stop being depressed\".  When you're that deep in the hole, it's nearly impossible to pull yourself out because you've already resigned yourself to death and also to the idea that you're not worth saving, and everyone would be better off with you gone.\n\nSame thing with him hiding his money from the caretaker.  He wasn't consciously doing it to make her life harder.  He was doing it because he felt he didn't deserve to get better, and he knew if he'd told her, she wouldn't have understood because who would willingly watch someone kill themselves like that.\n\nI think it was realistic how frustrated people became with him, but also a little grating at times that no one seemed to be able to comprehend why a mentally ill person would make irrational, self destructive decisions.\n\nHe's not a hero, and he's not a villain.  He's a guy who made an incredibly selfish, impulsive decision, caused a lot of suffering as a result, and then paid for it with his happiness and his life.  When we meet him, that person is long dead, and he's a shell of the man who did those things.  I don't think the film is trying to absolve Charlie of his past wrongdoings.  It's just painting a picture of an unfortunate situation that people often find themselves in in the real world.  There aren't always happy endings or meaningful lessons to learn.",

You know those movies where the credits roll and you're just sitting there like... \"what the fuck did I just watch?\" And then you're thinking about it for the next few days, replaying scenes in your head, overanalyzing everything, maybe even questioning everything....\n\nGenre doesn't really matter psychological thrillers, mystery thrillers, dramas, mind-benders,  deeply emotional stories, even comedies are all welcome. I just want something that leaves a mark.\n\nsome movies that did this to me: Fightclu....(uhh sorry I can't talk about it, rule- 1 and 2) , Interstellar, The Theory Of Everything, se7en, the Martian, prisoners, shutters island, grave of the fireflies....\n\nThanks!!!",
