        "content": "Hi Reddit! I'm Pedro Kos, director of Utopia's upcoming gripping found-footage horror film, In Our Blood, which is being released nationwide on October 24th. IN OUR BLOOD delves into the complexities of grief, documentary storytelling, and the struggles faced by society's most vulnerable.The film stars Brittany O\u2019Grady, E.J. Bonilla, Krisha Fairchild, and Alanna Ubach, who deliver deeply affecting performances that linger long after the credits roll.\n\nHappy to be here for an AMA! Ask me anything about the film, the filmmaking process, or horror in general. Can\u2019t wait to talk with you all!\n\n**Synopsis:**\n\nNothing is as it seems when filmmaker Emily Wyland (Brittany O\u2019Grady) teams up with cinematographer Danny (E. J. Bonilla) to shoot an intimate documentary about reuniting with Emily\u2019s estranged mother after a decade apart. When her mother suddenly goes missing, possibly succumbing to the addictions that first tore her family apart, Emily and Danny must piece together increasingly sinister clues to find her before it\u2019s too late.\n\n**More:**\n\nDirected by Oscar-nominated documentary filmmaker Pedro Kos (Rebel Hearts, Lead Me Home) in his first narrative feature, IN OUR BLOOD masterfully blends psychological mystery with chilling horror. The film weaves a twisted tale of reconciling with the ghosts of our past and confronting the complicity we share in creating a world that preys on the most vulnerable.\n\n**Trailer**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LynIegqcZr8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LynIegqcZr8)\n\nI'll be back at 5 PM PT / 8 PM ET today (Wednesday 10/22) to answer your questions.",

        "title": "I've probably watch Dead Poets Society over a 100 times during my adolescence, but I only realized some crazy details today",
        "content": "I just realized something kind of wild. I've probably seen Dead Poets Society a hundred times, but only now do I feel like I'm really understanding certain scenes. Maybe I was too young the first times I watched it, but on rewatch, things hit differently.\n\nFor example, the scene where Keating pushes Todd to improvise a poem in front of the class. For years I just thought it was an inspirational teacher moment, but I didn't get the deeper meaning. Keating tells Todd to look at the picture of W.W, a grim old man staring back, and says, \"Close your eyes. Describe what you see.\" Todd ends up saying: \"...a sweaty-toothed madman... his hands reach out and choke me...\" Back then I didn't realize this was Todd describing himself. His fear of expression, his anxiety, his self-loathing, all of that comes through in the words. Keating didn't just make him speak; he made him reveal himself.\n\nThat blanket image itself takes on a deeper symbolism the more I think about it. Todd says: \"You push at it, stretch it, it will never be enough. You kick at it, beat at it, it will never cover any of us. .\" At first it sounds abstract, but it\u2019s really about truth and acceptance. Keating uses this moment to push Todd to face who he really is. The blanket being too small for everyone becomes a metaphor that truth and self-expression can\u2019t be confined or limited, it\u2019s bigger than any of us. And then the haunting line: \"\u00a0From the moment we enter crying to the moment you leave dying.\", hich suddenly makes me think of birth and death, the painful but inescapable bookends of existence.\n\nThen there\u2019s Neil\u2019s suicide. When I was younger, I understood it was tragic, but I never really thought about the fact that Neil was only seventeen. That\u2019s still a child, and the pressure from his father, the crushing weight of not being able to live his own life, feels even heavier when you remember how young he is. It wasn\u2019t just about the play or his father forbidding him to act it was the loss of hope that he could ever be himself.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the Todd and Neil relationship. For the longest time I thought the idea of people shipping them was just fans being over the top. But looking back, there\u2019s real tension between them. I don\u2019t necessarily think either of them would have consciously recognized it, especially in 1959, but the intimacy is there. Todd\u2019s shyness breaking down under Neil\u2019s encouragement, Neil\u2019s obvious care for Todd, the way their interactions carry more weight than typical school friendships  there\u2019s something more, even if it\u2019s unspoken.\n\nIt\u2019s funny, because the movie hasn\u2019t changed, but I have. Now I see layers that were invisible to me before. Dead Poets Society really is one of those films that grows with you.",

        "content": "\"Since the beginning of last year, Blumhouse has been on a cold streak, releasing an almost uninterrupted string of box-office disappointments. In January 2024, the poorly reviewed 'Night Swim'\u00a0drowned theatrically, followed in failure by the murderous teddy bear-flick 'Imaginary' (which did not hemorrhage money due to its relatively microscopic budget but is regarded as a dud). That left the vacation-friends spatter-fest 'Speak No Evil' to provide Blumhouse\u2019s only positive cash flow for the year. Leading into this weekend, the Universal-partnered production company\u2019s entire 2025 slate had fizzled: the Julia Garner biomorph-scarer 'Wolf Man', the supernatural \u201ctrow-ma\u201d\u00a0'Woman in the Yard,' and the SXSW-anointed digital-dependency potboiler 'Drop' all undershot financial expectations en route to 'M3gan 2.0.,' Blumhouse\u2019s reigning \u201925 disaster.\"",
