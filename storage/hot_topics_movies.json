But what's a movie that you thought was gonna get talked about for a long time, but now nobody seems to talk about it at all. \n\nFor me it's gotta be Sin City, when I first saw that at the theater  I thought it was not even just a movie, that it was an experience. I thought it was just gonna be a movie that people talked about for ages. But I can't remember the last time I  heard Anyone talk about Sin City. And in fact, it's not even a movie I would wanna go back to, maybe it was just too mid 2000s.",

It's not helped that he IMMEDIATELY prioritizes attention on his new adopted daughter and neglects his son, and even TELLS off Sister Abigail who visits to warn them of Esther's presence near questionable situations. They were obviously just trying to make him the cliched idiot horror character to advance the plot.",

I love slowly watching Nicolas Cage solve the mystery of the snuff film. All the performances are great as well, James Gandolfini is so good in this film, he was such a great actor and made even small roles memorable.

        "content": "I just watched Ridley Scotts Good Year, not for the first time. I remember seeing it years ago and liking it immediately. I enjoyed the script, the acting, the cast, and Ridleys completely left field whimsical, almost goofy directing.\n\nSo yesterday I jumped over to Rotten Tomatoes just for the heck of it and was shocked to see the movie sits at 28%! I mean, I get it\u2019s not Ridleys or Crowes best work, it\u2019s a light comedy; but that low? \n\nMy palette is either way off, or something is going way over my head, so I was wondering if you guys told me what you thought about it.\n\n\n\n   ",

        "content": "Some films survive the decades without ever truly disappearing\u2014no matter how old they are, we continue to talk about them, quote them, and show them to the new generation.  \nBut sometimes, there are also films that, at the time of their release, seemed destined to be etched in pop culture... and then, strangely, they fade completely.  \nWhat is this film for you? The one you were sure would become a cult classic, but now seems forgotten by everyone?  \nPersonally, I think of Donnie Darko. At one time, it was on everyone's lips, especially among \"alternative\" teens. Now, I feel like no one really talks about it anymore. Maybe it was just very \"anchored\" in its time.  \nI'm curious to see your answers!",

        "content": "I like this mind-bending Cronenberg classic but can anyone explain what is actually going on and what the film is saying?\n\nSome more specific questions\u2026\n\n1. Max has bizarre hallucinations but these sometimes interact with reality. Assuming his hiding a gun in the new vagina in his stomach is a hallucination\u2026 what is actually occurring in reality in that moment?\n2. Same with Harlan stuffing a throbbing VHS tape in Max\u2019s stomach, only to withdraw a grenade instead of a hand which blows up, killing him. Again, if this is a hallucination then what actually happened? How could Harlan die from one of Max\u2019s hallucinations?\n3. What exactly does Barry Convex want Max to do? What are Convex\u2019s political goals?\n4. What does Bianca Oblivion want Max to do? What are her and her father\u2019s political goals?\n5. When Max shoots Barry Convex he doesn\u2019t just die, he grotesquely breaks apart and erupts in a hideous white brain like matter all over his body. Why?\n6. At the end Max hallucinates (?) a TV screen in which he shoot\u2019s himself and the screen explodes with guts. Why? Then he shoots himself believing he\u2019ll become \u2018the new flesh\u2019, what is that?\n\nThanks in advance \ud83d\ude4f\n\n  \n",

I loved the cinematography, the directing, the characters and over all the whole plot. I love how it made me feel like he was really talking to me and telling me his story, or updates on life and where hes at in his mind. 4/5 for me, but was anybody else ready for the ending of SLC punk? Because i definitely WAS NOT. ",
