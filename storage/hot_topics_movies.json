        "content": "If you guys recall, in MiB 1, Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) takes a seemingly special interest in Will Smith\u2019s character, who eventually becomes Agent J.\n\nJ is clearly talented and not like those other government robots but beyond that, even Rip Torn who mocks those guys is confused as to why Tommy Lee Jones was so insistent in picking Will Smith in particular.  Btw I\u2019m going back and forth between the character letters and the actor names to make it make sense for myself.\n\nIn MiB3, it\u2019s revealed that K had traveled back in time\\* and witnessed not only J as a small kid but the death of his father, and K knew he was basically unwittingly responsible for how J grew up. But K doesn\u2019t treat it as a burden, he\u2019s honored by it and the father\u2018s heroic sacrifice.\n\nSo in the first movie, Tommy Lee Jones\u2019 insistence that Will Smith should not only be a new MiB agent but even his replacement when he retires makes all the more sense.\n\n\\*edit: sorry for fucking that up, Tommy Lee Jones didn\u2019t travel back in time of course, but we did. And he had those memories. ",

        "title": "'Train Dreams' felt like home.",
        "content": "I grew up and live in Eastern Washington, I watched Train Dreams last night after seeing it recommended and seeing William H. Macy is in it, and while talking about it with family they mentioned it was filmed in our area. \n\n I don't think I've ever watched a movie that felt so relatable in a way this movie did for me, the scenery is what I see everyday and it made me more grateful for where I live. We have a running joke in our family that William H. Macy is our father because of his role as Frank Gallagher in Shameless plus he looks and sounds like our dad. Every character in the movie felt like someone I know, every actor/actress did so well for their characters, especially William H. Macy as the old \"things ain't like they used to be\" man was so accurate, worked with many guys like that. \n\n I instantly knew they used White's Boots in the film because I used to make them, the old railroads and old shops remind me of road trips to small old towns, the views of downtown Spokane, the mention of towns many wouldn't know if they aren't from here all remind me of \"home\". The fact it's revolved around logging is familiar as I've worked in a lumber mill and watched the whole process using the same type of trees and watched how the logs kept getting smaller and smaller over time. \n\nI went in expecting to watch a good movie, not expecting a feeling of nostalgia and gratefulness for the place I call home. It encaptures the feeling of Eastern Washington perfectly, if I ever live somewhere else I would show people this movie as an example of where I came from. Such a fantastic film that I can see myself watching over and over again.\n\nAre there any movies that you've watched that felt like \"home\" to you? I'm interested to hear. \n\n",

Both seem horribly depressing to me (and in a way I like that because I\u2019m a fan of the dramatic genre). What do you think of the movie? Obviously it\u2019s more censored than the book, but I think it\u2019s pretty good. What about you?",

        "content": "Like I know that the Twilight series is uh mid, but the soundtracks for every single installment is like a perfect introduction to mid2010s indie music. We Bought a Zoo is okay, pretty good, maybe a little forgettable, but the Jonsi music makes me want to be a better human being.  I liked The Hours fine, but I love the soundtrack\u2014 Philip Glass at his Philip Glass best. \n\nSimilarly in kids\u2019 movies, some of the (I shutter to say) Paw Patrol movies have surprisingly good tunes. \u201cBark to the Beat\u201d is\u2026 weirdly acceptable. My Little Pony also punches above its weight. \n\nWhat other movies have soundtracks that are better than the movies themselves?",
