For example killers of the flower moon had both Robert deniro and Leonardo DiCaprio but more people probably saw that film because it was directed by Scorsese than they did for the lead actors. ",

But that is just about the only major flaw this movie has, and its easy to get used to. The music, cinematography and animation all slap so hard. The standout feature though is the writing. Every single joke is clever, the plot is well paced, all the characters are unique and interact well with each other. \n\nAnd the premise, outright hillarious. I wont spoil anything but its a tightly interwoven set of threads that recontextualize each other; which all get expertly revealed in the correct order to maximize impact. Not to mention that despite the fairy tale aestetics, it delivers emotional moments and covers interpersonal relationships with light hearted respect. Also there is mystery and foreshaddowing for those paying attention and trying to piece the puzzle together before the characters do. ",

I prioritize choreography but love humor and always a fan of a good romantic storyline. \n",

        "content": "I'm interested in more movies about people from the past somehow ending up in present time.  But when I search for it, I just get lists of movies that involve any tyoe of time travel. I don't want people from present time traveling back in time or forward into the future, or people from the future traveling to today... I'm looking for the amusement of characters from the past being fascinated or surprised about basic modern technology and lifestyles.\n\nThink Hocus Pocus and the witches being surprised by the fire sprinkler systems, a paved road, or a car.\n\nOthers I can think of that I've seen: Blast From The Past, Bill &amp; Ted's, \n\nBut throw more recommendations at me!  I don't mind cheesy TV movies as well.",
