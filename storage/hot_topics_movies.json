Here to answer your questions!\n\nIf you want to know more about us here are our credits\n\n* St\u00e9phane\u2005Naz\u00e9: [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0623408/?ref\\_=fn\\_all\\_nme\\_1](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0623408/?ref_=fn_all_nme_1)\n* Lo\u00efc Mireault: [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm12787058/?ref\\_=fn\\_all\\_nme\\_1](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm12787058/?ref_=fn_all_nme_1)\n* Kevin Sears: [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3010149/?ref\\_=nv\\_sr\\_srsg\\_0\\_tt\\_4\\_nm\\_4\\_in\\_0\\_q\\_kevin%2520sears](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3010149/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_4_nm_4_in_0_q_kevin%2520sears)\n\nHere\u2019s a taste of what we tackled on **Superman**:\n\nWe collaborated closely with director James Gunn and VFX Supervisor St\u00e9phane Ceretti to reimagine Superman\u2019s world, not just with spectacle, but with nuance, heart, and technical innovation.\n\n\\-Krypto the Superdog. Inspired by James Gunn\u2019s dog Ozu, we captured every subtle gesture, emotion, and furry leap to ensure Krypto felt like a genuine canine first, only one who happened to have superpowers.\n\n\\-The Fortress of Solitude: We designed the Fortress using more than 6000 reflective crystals, each one a challenge in shading, lighting, and rendering.\n\n\\-4D Gaussian Splatting: A first in feature film, we used 4D Gaussian Splat to create Superman\u2019s Kryptionian parents hologram.\n\n\\-And also the Engineer\u2019s nanite power suit, SupermanRobots, Lex vs Krypto fight scene and more! You can learn about our work here: [https://www.framestore.com/work/superman](https://www.framestore.com/work/superman) \n\nWe\u2019ll be back today (Tuesday 8/16) at 3PM ET to answer your burning questions. In the meantime, ask away, we\u2019re excited to dive into the murk and magic of bringing Superman to life! Ask us anything!",

One of the last films I remember seeing him in was Three Fugitives (and I was happy to be reminded about Prince of Tides ... phew).  I went in blind on Warrior, only knowing that Tom Hardy was in it and was shocked to see Nick.  More shocking was how honest and sad his portrayal of Paddy Conlon was. The Casino and hotel scene were both so very different and so gut wrenching.  It was hard.\n\nI know the movie wasn't necessarily about him but I thought the ending was a little too Karate Kid in the way it dismissed his demons so cleanly and simply had him looking on like a proud dad. \n\nAnyway, just finished and it's still raw and with me and thought I'd share.",

Their presence although might be small, but they make a direct impact on the film\n\nThis is a complicated question for any movie buff such as myself, but if I were to put a name to it, I\u2019d 100% choose Robert Duvall. \n\nWho\u2019s your choice? \n\n***Edit: after going through this entire thread, I didn\u2019t see ONE person talk shit. Not one single person start an argument. Just literally a bunch of good people talking about their favorite actors and it really made me feel quite nostalgic.

He wasn\u2019t some over-the-top monster; he was refined, calm, and even likable on the surface, which made the sinister edge underneath all the more chilling.\n\nThat smooth Southern drawl, the sly smile, the way he carried himself \u2014 it was like he *knew* he already owned the room (and maybe your soul, too). He gave the Devil a sort of gentlemanly charisma that made the stakes of the bargain feel very real.",

        "content": "I went on a George C. Scott binge recently, and I came across Hardcore. This film is really interesting, it is about a father whose teenage daughter goes missing in California and turns up in a porno film. This leads him to search for her and leads him into the subculture of pornography.\u00a0\n\nI got to say, I honestly think this film is overlooked &amp; underrated. What makes the film is George C. Scott and his performance as the father, Jake van Horn, who immerses himself into the industry we would never dare go into, just so that he could find his daughter. George C. Scott is just a good actor, who always commits himself to the role and always is the best part of anything he is in. Season Hubley is also great as Joanne, a prostitute who help Jake find his daughter. What I like is that Joanne and Jake found a grudging respect for each other, in spite of the cultural differences between them. Also good was Peter Boyle as the private investigator\n\nHowever, I did feel that the ending was a bit of a letdown, which I found predictable. I did read that Paul Schrader was forced to change the ending from what he originally intended it to be.\u00a0\n\nBut regardless I did enjoy the film and I do think it is overlooked.",
