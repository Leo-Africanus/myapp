They added it to Hulu and I was looking for something to watch while I work on some projects. \n\nDANG I totally forgot how many amazing actors they got for this film.  Mark Wahlberg, Zoey Deschanel, John Leguizamo, and I was surprised to see Alan Ruck and Jeremy Strong too. \n\nThe actors are soooo good but the dialogue is SO bad that it makes them all look like it\u2019s their first time performing. And the story line is like\u2026 idk definitely interesting enough to keep you watching. It\u2019s really my favorite combo. \n\nI find it hilarious that they keep some things out of view of the audience (people shooting themselves in the head) then 10 minutes later show a man voluntarily feeding his own arm to a lion. The direction is absolutely insane. \n\nWell worth a rewatch imo if you haven\u2019t seen it in a while and are looking for something entertaining. ",

One of the major sub plots involves a brother/teacher in this religious school and he's abusive in a realistic way. It's disturbing. He enjoys the corporal punishment he inflicts on the students. \n\nAs the movie nears the end... something happens where McCarthy finally fights back from the abuse and it's such a moment, such a rush for me I've never forgotten that feeling. Anyone have that with another film?",

        "title": "The most epic sci-fi movie ever partially-made is not for everyone, but you should watch it. Thoughts \"On The Silver Globe\" (1988)",
        "content": "Story time. Back when I was a wee 18-year-old lad in 2008 I got my first job working in film and met a bunch of industry veterans who recommended a lot of unique movies and it just happened to be when Netflix was like 5 dollars a month to have 2 DVDs mailed a month and they had a broad selection of obscure movies. During this time I saw Fantastic Planet, El Topo, The Holy Mountain, Stalker, Come and See, 120 days of Sodom, Enter the Void, City of God, Kangaroo Jack, just incredible films (except that last one, lol) that were so unique and corrupted my innocent mind with devilishly brilliant new ideas about what a movie could be. But one in particular has haunted and fascinated me ever since. Let me warn you, On The Silver Globe from 1988 is a difficult watch on par with Come and See in just how horrifying and strange it is, but it's also worth watching because there will likely never be anything like it ever again. This is because it's an unfinished masterpiece made unintentionally more brilliant by the fact that it wasn't finished because the Polish government literally shut down production due to the political themes of the film. They burned the sets and costumes and the director Andrzej Zulawski's magnum opus wasn't able to be fully realized. However, luckily, the film reels that were shot in the 1970's were smuggled out of the country and edited into a new film in 1988 that replaced the missing scenes with strange and surreal footage of pedestrians on the street which were then narrated with what was supposed to happen in that scene. And something about it works so well and elevates the film to a true work of art. BUT again, this movie is almost 3 hours of terrifying, uncanny, strange, and disturbing rumination and footage that sometimes barely makes sense and most people will probably not like this movie. However, if you appreciate truly unique films that are unlike anything you have ever seen, it is free on YouTube and it will haunt your dreams for years to come.",

I really enjoyed it despite the carelessness of &gt;!handling nuclear materials!&lt;\n\nThe movie reminded of another movie, WarGames (1983) which I've seen countless times since the early 90s. It had the same vibe, wiz kid discovers something, builds or plays with it, and then eventually gets into trouble with the US Government/Military.\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations similar to WarGames and The Manhattan Project? Doesn't necessarily have to be made in the 80s but I think that's part of the charm. The whole Cold War-paranoia / nuclear war tension.\n\nP.S. WarGames still has an impressive movie set even to this day. The whole NORAD Commend Center set with WOPR is just amazing.",

I was there in theaters for both, vastly enjoyed both, and for people off my age would not consider the split particularly meaningful. But still, is hard to ignore the fact that there are roughly 20 years between the two movies. So I was wondering if there are similar moments for movies from around the 1980's",

        "title": "the ending of the original the fly is disturbing on so many levels.",
        "content": "in my opinion, the scariest movie ending is the ending of the original the fly. although i prefer the cronenberg remake, the original film is a solid movie and the ending is more disturbing then anything that cronenberg could have cooked up. it's scary and disturbing on so many levels to the point that, no matter how many times i watch the movie, the ending still gives me chills.\n\nfor starters. this ending plays exploits so many phobias at once. arachnophobia is the obvious one but there's also vorarephobia, the fear of being eaten alive.\n\nand then, there's the fact that we finally get a good look at how the fly with andre's head and arm looks and it's...freaky. for some reason, the fly is bald and looks rather old. it looks rather creepy. and when the fly speaks, it doesn't really mouth words but just kinda opens and closes it's mouth in a rather unnatural way. \n\nand speaking of the fly, throughout the whole thing, the fly is begging and pleading for it's life. you'd think that the high pitched vocals would make the scene less scary but i would actually argue that it makes it MORE scary. fun fact, while filming the scene, vincent price and herbert marshall had a hard time filming the scene without bursting out laughing upon hearing the high pitched voice. how much are you willing to bet that they weren't laughing when they saw the finished product? \n\nand then, there is the spider itself. this scene gets us up close and personal with the spider and it looks terrifying. \n\nthere's also the question of whether the fly has andre's brain or if this is a fly trapped in a man's body. the film seems to lean more towards the ladder but that makes things even worse. andre with the fly's head is becoming more and more fly like over the course of the film. as such, it stands to reason that the fly was becoming more human like. for god's sake, the fly learned to speak.\n\nand of course, this already unsettling scene becomes even more so if you know what spiders actually do to their prey. \n\nall these things combined result in one of the scariest endings of any movie ever.",
