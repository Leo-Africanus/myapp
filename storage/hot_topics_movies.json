        "content": "*Plagued by a violent and recurring nightmare, a college student heads home to track down the one person who might be able to break the cycle of death and save her family from the grisly demise that inevitably awaits them all.*\n\nDirector: Zach Lipovsky, Adam Stein\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [94%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/final_destination_bloodlines)\n\n**Metacritic:** [75/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/final-destination-bloodlines/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter - Frank Schech](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/final-destination-bloodlines-review-1236214028/)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s not whether but *how* the victims will die that gives these films their juice, and *Final Destination Bloodlines* doesn\u2019t disappoint. It does get bogged down in a tedious plotline revolving around dysfunctional family dynamics that makes you impatient for the deaths to start coming. But once they do, the grisly fun resumes. The gory set pieces, involving such things as a lawnmower, a garbage truck, and, most spectacularly, an MRI machine, are so cleverly orchestrated that the audience at the preview screening applauded each one as if they were song-and-dance numbers. The combination of CGI and practical effects works seamlessly, and the sequences are sadistically edited for maximum tension, which is thankfully relieved by frequent doses of mordant humor.\n\n[DEADLINE - Gregory Nussen](https://deadline.com/2025/05/final-destination-bloodlines-review-1236394628/)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s a raucously good time, replete with enough subtle nods to previous entries and cheekily placed music cues for the most loyal of the franchise\u2019s fans. That it also includes some genuinely heartfelt moments, including a nicely written farewell to the series\u2019 lone consistent member William Bludworth (the late, truly great Tony Todd), is a delicious cherry on top of this reliable, horrific recipe dripping in blood and guts.\n\n[IGN - Tom Jorgensen](https://www.ign.com/articles/final-destination-bloodlines-review) \\- 8/10 (Great)\n\n&gt;In Final Destination: Bloodlines, death is the life of the party. There\u2019s little novelty to the boilerplate family trauma plot of this sixth Final Destination movie, but what its comedy-forward take on the franchise\u2019s established formula lacks in thematic depth, it more than makes up for with delightful, well-designed kills and boundless gallows humor. A testament to the powerful, simple joy of a well-executed setup and payoff, Bloodlines\u2019 lethal Rube Goldberg machines are tactile and satisfying, benefiting from a solid blend of goopy practical and visual effects. It\u2019s a fantastic jumping-on point for new fans, but the Final Destination faithful are well taken care of with cheeky references to previous movies and a truly poignant farewell from one of the horror genre\u2019s late kings, Tony Todd.\n\n[The Guardian - Radheyan Simonpillai](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/may/13/final-destination-bloodlines-review-horror) \\- 4/5\n\n&gt;Where Bloodlines excels is in the clever and often diabolical storytelling craft and visuals. There\u2019s a decadence in the film-making that isn\u2019t at odds with the campy nature of Final Destination but instead realizing its full potential.\n\n[AV Club - Jacob Oller ](https://www.avclub.com/final-destination-bloodlines-review)\\- B-\n\n&gt;As the *Final Destination* films have continued on, they\u2019ve gotten meaner, less superficially concerned with survival and more explicitly giddy at the prospect of a nasty death trap or a jumpy \u201ccrushed by a huge thing in an instant\u201d reversal. *Final Destination Bloodlines* embraces this late-period slasher-minus-slasher construction, with Lipovsky and Stein eagerly constructing deaths into applause moments celebrated with the same bursts of bloody confetti. These movies are built to be splattery supercuts showcasing the warped imaginations of horror filmmakers and special effects professionals, exploiting the call of the void that everyday objects can sound throughout our lives. *Bloodlines* does so playfully and lightly, without getting bogged down by franchise lore or pesky cinematic tropes like \u201ccharacters.\u201d The long gap between series entries means the film doesn\u2019t need to subvert expectations, but merely play into them\u2014in doing so, it\u2019s a success as simple as its death traps are convoluted.\n\n[Next Best Picture - Josh Parham](https://nextbestpicture.com/final-destination-bloodlines/) \\- 7/10\n\n&gt;This franchise loves to utilize the wind as an element to signal death\u2019s encroaching presence. It was easy to fall into parody before, but there, it was deployed in a manner that is both unsettling and ludicrous. That is the perfect summation of this film. It swerves towards originality in some places and doesn\u2019t break the mold in others, but it has a firm grasp on exuberant violence that will captivate a cheering audience that revels in a character being squashed under a falling piano. If you\u2019re that type of sicko, then this one will be one of the better rides this series has to offer.",

        "content": " \nThis is more of a rambling about \"what I took away from the movie\" rather than a review. If you haven't watched Locke, go watch it right now. It's a short 80 minute movie, and due to it being set in a single scene for it's entirety it feels even shorter. I suggest going in completely blind. But if you *really* want to know something, it's bassically &gt;!an 80 minute movie set entirely in a car where Ivan Locke, played by Tom Hardy, makes a series of phone calls to some other characters regarding a big cement project and the birth of his child through an affair with a coworker!&lt;. \n\nAnyways, now that you've watched it, this is what I have to say. In every call Ivan could've lied or made the morally wrong choice to make his life easier. Instead in every instance, he strives to tell the truth and do the right thing. The first proper thought I had about him as a character while watching was \"he's playing every single card right\". He was playing this situation in the best possible way, choosing each word perfectly. He was being the best possible human he could be in this fucked up situation. It's just a shame that the odds were entirely against him from the start due to his original mistake of cheating on Katherine. It's commendable honestly, he isn't a bad person, he's actually a very good person, who just so happened to make a very shitty mistake. You can't even blame all the other characters for reacting the way they did, in the end it is Ivan's fault. But the fact that he owns up to it in an incredible way makes him redeemable. When Kathrine says \"it's never once\", I genuinely felt she was making a mistake saying that. I don't blame her for saying or thinking that, she'd be right most of the time, if it were any other man. But after seeing Ivan managing this situation in such a way, I do thing he is the kind of person who wouldn't cheat again.\n\nThe whole cement thing interestingly also had a more literal version of the message behind it too. Obviously Ivan choosing to go forward with the cement project was the right thing, but even beyond that, both Ivan and Donal going out of their way to make sure it all went correctly is the perfect example of doing something the right way instead of the easy way. They could've easily laid back and relaxed after making only the necessary checks, but then they would have never found out about the whole C5 and C6 situation, or the fault rebar.\n\nThe reason why this message speaks to me is because that's how *I* want to be in life. It's the way I've been raised and it's something my grandfather used to teach too. God forbid I ever end up in a situation like that, but in any poor situation, I want to be able to choose the right thing over the easy thing. And that's why I enjoyed watching Ivan. Quite often you see characters in movies and shows make stupid and wrong decisions, that you know are wrong, both literally and morally, and you're there screaming at them to stop through the screen. But Ivan does it correctly, all like a good person. Despite having to watch the whole heartbreaking situation unfold, it was still satisfying to watch him stay strong with each phone call and continue to say and do the right thing. There are other messages you can get from the movie too, all of which I could also write a lot about, but this was the strongest for me. Weirdly enough, with the bitter ending, we still got a great moral out of the story. ",

That means the remake is now canonically part of the wider Karate Kid universe when it was originally just a remake of the first movie.\n\nIs this the first time something like this has happened?  Or are there other examples where a movie's remake was later canonically brought into the same continuity as the original movie?",

        "title": "The Total Recall movie fixed a huge dumb problem with the original short story",
        "content": "I've loved Total Recall for years so I wanted to finally read the short story it was based on, \"We Can Remember It For You Wholesale\" by Philip K Dick. And the short story is... kinda dumb, even compared to a Schwartzeneggar movie. Specifically this one aspect.\n\nThe story and movie are vastly different, but the setup is basically the same in both.\n\nStory and movie: An ordinary man is bored with his average life on earth and endlessly dreams of having adventures on Mars. He discovers a company called Rekal, which boasts it can implant 100% convincing false memories into your mind. He pays for the memory of an epic adventure on Mars in which he's a badass action hero spy. The procedure fails catastrophically because he actually IS a badass spy and just doesn't remember it.\n\nIn the movie, they made a very wise change. Rekal in the film makes sense as a business. Rekal is basically an entertainment company. You have a memory of a thrilling adventure, then it ends and you go back to your life. It's like a movie. You know it wasn't real and yet you have the satisfied feeling of coming home from an epic vacation, only with no personal risk and a lot less financial burden.\n\nHere's what immediately bugged me about the short story. In the story, Rekal is supposed to convince you that their fake memories are real. Period. They give you fake \"souvenirs\" from your adventure. They delete the last couple weeks of your real memories. They even delete your memories of coming to Rekal. You will just wake up at home after your \"adventure\" is over.\n\nMy issue: How is that supposed to work? They expect you to believe you're a spy assassin, but still show up for your shift at T Mobile? To just keep waiting on new orders from the agency that will never show up? What if you try to tell your wife? She'll correctly assume you're insane. What if you get mugged? You'll think you can do John Wick moves on the gunman and then get shot in the face. How can you live an ordinary life believing you're basically a superhero? Rekal is pretty much a company that charges you to ruin your life.",
