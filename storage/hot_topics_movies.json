Nic Cage is suitably unhinged, and the action scenes and production design are manic and over-the-top in a fun way. Directed by the people who brought the Crank movies, if you watched the behind the scenes they put their lives on the line to pull off the stunts. The story is whatever, but are you there for that or to see Ghost Rider piss fire? The only thing missing was a hard R rating but I was entertained and it didn\u2019t overstay its welcome \n",

        "content": "I know the movie is set up like this moving story about a android  boy looking for the mother he lost after he was abandoned but the whole narrative was based on a lie. \n\nThe reality is David was used by two grieving parents whose own son was in a coma and when the son revived, David became of no use to them. \n\nWhat pissed me off the most was the mother, Monica (Frances O'Connor). She purposefully made David into a self-aware sentient being instead of the dutiful robot he was which then led him to become attached to her. And then, when her son revived and the brat started bullying David and then causing him to \"misbehave\", the dad was quick to decide in deactivating David. \n\nI'm of the belief David should have been deactivated all along. It was of no use to keep David \"alive\". For what? So he could spend years and years by himself, looking for a mother who never really loved him. Oh sure, she cared enough about David to not have him go to the factory but it was her conscience because she knew it was her own fault, not because she loved this android boy. \n\nIt's such a sad, tragic movie. I felt bad for David but it was a hopeless endeavor. The dream of him playing with Monica comforted him but it was all for nothing. \n\nThe brat human son had the family David never had.",

Even in the trailer Keanu says \u201cI gave him money and it solved most of his problems\u201d \n\nThen started thinking about how so many movies cannot land that answer. Another one was the movie the materialists. To make it rational to the viewers why she would choose her broke ex over the rich guy they show like 2 scenes of him being mean to her after like 10 scenes of them going to different high end restaurants having an amazing time.\n\nAny movies you guys think answer the question \u201cmoney isn\u2019t everything question\u201d ",

        "content": "So I recently watched Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein for the first time as part of a Universal Monster movie watch party, and was surprised that it wasn't what I expected. I expected a spoof that made a bunch of jokes at the monsters' expense similar to modern horror comedy movies, instead I noticed that the scenes with the monsters were all treated seriously and played completely straight like they were from any of the previous Universal Monster movies. Only Abbott and Costello's scenes had any comedy, if they weren't on screen there were no jokes, and even when they were on screen, the monsters and other characters were still meant to be serious and/or scary. \n\nThis got me thinking, I admittedly haven't seen that many old comedy movies, but most of the ones I've seen (especially Marx Brothers movies) are similar in that regard. They feel like most of the characters are acting like they're in a normal movie, but then these comedic actors come in and make a lot of jokes. Basically, it seems to me that what sets apart old comedy movies to modern comedy movies, is that in older comedies only a few characters were meant to be funny, while in modern comedies everyone is meant to be funny.\n\nWhy were older comedies like this? What changed? When did this change happen? Or am I completely wrong and making assumptions and the old comedies I've seen aren't representative of everything?",

        "content": "I saw it on VHS through Blockbusters and I wasn't expecting a lot. I knew it had been a failure. It got theatrically released in my country and my sister tried to see it, she wasn't allowed in because it was R-rated. \n\nI was SHATTERED when I saw Strange Days. I couldn't believe how daring and creative the film was and the direction was stunning. Stylish, quick and kinetic, every major sequence was a adrenalin rush, like when the two cops are chasing after a woman on the subway and it isn't shot like a clean sequence, it's highly aggressive. Like the snuff sequence shot on video and through the perspective of the killer, a highly disturbing scene. \n\nI had seen The English Patient before so I was taken aback by Ralph Fiennes playing Lenny Nero, a part I wouldn't have expected from Ralph Fiennes and yet he killed it. He was convincing as a \"loser\" who becomes imbroiled in a dangerous situation he can't comprehend while obsessing over his ex, Faith, played by a smoldering Juliette Lewis. The standout, though, was Angela Basset as Mace, a bodyguard/limousine driver who's a cool fierce warrior and becomes a protector/platonic lover of Lenny Nero when he wounds up being targeted. Even small roles played by Vincent D'Onofrio, Michael Wincott, Josef Sommer and Tom Sizemore stand out. The casting process made no mistakes.\n\nIt's also a commentary on race in America while set in a dystopian future of the US (sadly current today) and using the Rodney King beating as a inspiration for a key subplot. \n\nKathryn Bigelow, a genius, and someone I wish had directed more films.",

        "content": "Dang, what a movie.\n\nNow I would not say that it is the best movie of all time, of course, but I have to say that I was hooked from beginning to end. They did everything really well, from the acting, fight scenes, story, plot, and even nailed the quiet moments of the characters.  It felt like Steins; Gate having a baby with Helldivers 2. \n\nTom Cruise's acting in this movie was excellent for me, as the realism of his being put on the frontlines that he never experienced was immaculate. I have always known him as the \"Mission: Impossible\" guy, but he totally showed how he is a genuinely good actor. Emily Blunt as the full metal was really cool as well. Her chemistry with Tom really felt like they were real people fighting to save the world. \n\nOverall, this movie was such a treat. Going into a movie blind is the best way for me to watch, as it can surprise me in so many ways. Since I'm a massive fan of Steins; Gate and Helldivers, this movie gets a 9/10 for me. I'm kind of saddened to the fact that no one really remembers this movie.",

MISTRESS DISPELLER is a documentary about a woman who breaks up affairs in China. It's out in theaters now. Ask me anything!\n\nIn China, a new industry has emerged devoted to helping couples stay married in the face of infidelity. Wang Zhenxi is part of this growing profession and is hired to go undercover and break up affairs by any means necessary; a \u201cmistress dispeller.\u201d Offering strikingly intimate access to a real, unfolding love triangle, Mistress Dispeller documents all sides of what is usually kept behind closed doors. As Teacher Wang attempts to bring a couple back from the edge of crisis, sympathies shift between husband, wife and mistress while emotion, pragmatism and cultural norms collide in this spellbinding look at modern love.\n\n**Trailer:** \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUep-cxvQZo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUep-cxvQZo)\n\nThe film opens in New York on 10/22 and Los Angeles on 10/23 before expanding around the country in the weeks that follow. The film is currently at 100% on Rotten Tomatoes (24 reviews).\n\nAsk me anything! I'll be back tomorrow (Monday 10/20) at 3:00 PM ET to answer questions :)\n\n",

        "content": "Just did a rewatch. Absolutely love the movie, one thing I had never fully understood - how long was the crew stranded together? I had always assumed multiple weeks, if not a couple months. Assumed large time lapses when it cuts to black between scenes. Looked it up online and most sites claim 5 days. Which made me really wonder if that was right. Blair is locked in a shed for like half of that, but during that time he digs out an ice cave and creates half a ship from helicopter parts? Am I getting that wrong? Either the duration should be way more than 5 days or that seems like a very odd inclusion in the story. ",

The action was probably the biggest letdown. It was like they said \u201cHey, let\u2019s take that which made the original a breakthrough movie and not even bother with the fighting choreography. We\u2019ll just edit the moves together in a choppy way like we\u2019re making some type of cheap CW kids superhero show.\u201d\n\nHonestly, I\u2019ve seen better choreography from the Power Rangers. The 90s ones, yes.\n\nAnyway, the first trailer for Matrix Resurrections was beyond fire. I can\u2019t recall many other trailers with such hype. That must have been where most of the budget went \ud83d\ude04",
