        "content": "I remember first coming across this rumour maybe ten years ago and immediately finding it suspicious: it gently sexualised a charismatic, 'wholesome' actor and suggested a highly friendly and funny atmosphere on set - it felt like fan-fiction about real people, something very online fans of The Mummy might like to imagine happened. \n\nThe only evidence were photographs of Arnold Vosloo and Brendan Fraser laughing and smiling during an interview for The Mummy with subtitles of the interview embedded at the base of the image:\n\n&gt;*\"We' re filming the prologue. The cameras start rolling. I'm standing by, and we're all waiting for Patricia to make her entrance. Instead, out struts Brendan dressed like Anck-Su-Namun. Body paint, gold pasties, and everything else.\"*\n\n&gt;*\"\\*Laughing\\* I wasn't even supposed to be on set that day. Arnold's face was the funniest shit I ever saw.\"*\n\nAnd again, the dialogue reads like someone who's trying to sound like an actor telling an anecdote during an interview. \n\nNow this has evolved, and clickbait Facebook pages tell the same story with AI images. \n\nI've always found this example slightly worrying - it's always appeared to me to be something that sounds plausible while still being obviously fake. However, it seems to have become a generally accepted bit of BTS trivia. \n\nAnother good example of the same phenomenon would be the frequently repeated 'fact' that Peter Jackson wanted any stunt rider who wanted going to be at the front of the Rohirrim's charge in The Return of the King to prove their love of Tolkien's books by quoting Theoden's speech - obvious horseshit to anyone who knows anything about how film sets work. \n\nAre there any other examples of popular BTS anecdotes which are bullshit?

        "content": "[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/marty_supreme): 96% (28 reviews) with 9.40 in average rating\n\n[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/marty-supreme/): 96/100 (7 critics)\n\nAs with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** Beware, some contain spoilers.\n\n&gt; Not every thread is spun out into something narratively substantive \u2014 Marty\u2019s idea of orange ping pong balls to stand out against white uniforms is a lot of buildup for one admittedly funny sight gag \u2014 but as a kinetic portrait of a life in perpetual motion, Marty Supreme is a wonder. Calling something \u201ca wild ride\u201d is one of the most hackneyed quote-whore favorites \u2014 see also: \u201cWhat a ride!\u201d \u201cThe thrill ride of the summer!\u201d and \u201cA nonstop rollercoaster ride!\u201d \u2014 but for this wraparound sensory experience, it\u2019s a neat fit.\n\n-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/marty-supreme-review-timothee-chalamet-josh-safdie-1236432539/)\n\n&gt; While \u201cUncut Gems\u201d starts in its hero\u2019s asshole and ends in the back of his head, \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d is a lot more open-ended. Marty Mauser is no less rapacious than Howard Ratner, but he\u2019s gripped by a dream instead of an addiction, and while Safdie obviously gets off on following Marty deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole of his own deranged vision quest, the real thrill of this movie \u2014 which accrues an immense emotional undertow by its final scenes \u2014 is in watching Marty tunnel out the other side. In watching him figure out, on his own naive terms, that \u201cevery man for himself\u201d can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. In watching him learn first-hand how easily the pursuit of success can become just another recipe for solipsism. The American Dream is just another slogan, and being the best salesman below 14th Street doesn\u2019t protect Safdie\u2019s protagonist from the possibility that he might also be the area\u2019s biggest mark. Marty might like to think of himself as \u201cthe ultimate product of Hitler\u2019s defeat,\u201d but the greatness of this movie is in how Chalamet\u2019s performance gradually sells us on the idea that he doesn\u2019t have to be. \n\n-[David Ehrlich, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/marty-supreme-movie-review-timothee-chalamet-a24-1235163722/): A\n\n&gt; The movies have rarely given us such an entitled underdog, and it\u2019s both mesmerizing and maddening to watch this arrogant table-tennis prodigy ricochet from high to low for nearly two and a half hours. In the defining performance of his still-burgeoning career, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet \u2014 aka \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d \u2014 makes you want to believe in this instantly iconic character too \u2026 even if sometimes you also want to strangle him.\n\n-[Peter Debruge, Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/marty-supreme-review-timothee-chalamet-josh-safdie-1236596290/)\n\n&gt; This new film from Josh Safdie has the fanatical energy of a 149-minute ping pong rally carried out by a single player running round and round the table. It\u2019s a marathon sprint of gonzo calamities and uproar, a sociopath-screwball nightmare like something by Mel Brooks \u2013 only in place of gags, there are detonations of bad taste, cinephile allusions, alpha cameos, frantic deal-making, racism and antisemitism, sentimental yearning and erotic adventures. It\u2019s a farcical race against time where no one needs to eat or sleep.\n\n-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/dec/01/marty-supreme-review-timothee-chalamet-ping-pong-table-tennis): 5/5\n\n&gt; What Safdie, and his co-writer, co-producer, and co-editor Ronald Bronstein have made is decidedly not a biopic but rather a fictionalized portrait of a \u2018what makes Sammy run\u2019 type of character from the lower east side of NY who scavengers for money \u2013 and yes happiness \u2013 in any way he knows how. With the perfect casting of Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as its title star, you go along for this wild ride of a young man in a hurry, but sometimes his own worst enemy.\n\n-[Pete Hammond, Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/12/marty-supreme-review-timothee-chalamet-triumphs-in-josh-safdies-character-rich-rocky-of-ping-pong-movies-1236631107/)\n\n&gt; A film this bracing and original deserves something much more inventive. But Marty Supreme has such scope, ambition and humour that its flaws, as with those off-screen Timmy exploits, are easy to overlook.\n\n-[Caryn James, BBC](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20251128-marty-supreme-review): 4/5\n\n&gt; This all makes for one rip-roaring film, but I suspect none of it would come together as well were it not for Chalamet, who is the main focus of virtually every scene, save for one or two moments. If you met someone like Marty in real life you might want to get as far away from them as possible, and yet Chalamet is so good at making this jerk likable that you're won over by his story \u2014 all of which leads to a shockingly emotional crescendo that packs a real punch. This is unquestionably the best performance of Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's career, and \"Marty Supreme\" is one of the best movies of the year. I can't wait to watch it again.\n\n-[Chris Evangelista, Slash Film](https://www.slashfilm.com/2039927/marty-supreme-review/): 10/10\n\n&gt; This makes Marty Supreme great entertainment, and the most convincing case yet that Chalamet is a real-deal star, capable of carrying a movie without the cultural context and memorable supporting turns of something like A Complete Unknown. Yet as the movie sprints through its After Hours-ish gauntlets, it sometimes feels like Safdie is more focused on clearing jaw-dropping hurdles than connecting these obstacle courses into a bigger picture.\n\n-[Jesse Hassenger, The A.V. Club](https://www.avclub.com/marty-supreme-review): B+\n\n&gt; So self-assured, yet so monstrous to those in his orbit, Marty feels like a nightmare version of the American dream, a suspicion bolstered by the film\u2019s placement in the 1950s at a time when the US was ascendant after the Second World War. The character\u2019s heedless pursuit of what he thinks is owed him represents the worst kind of \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d while perverting the familiar cinematic notion of the lovable sports underdog. And yet, we cannot take our eyes off of Chalamet, who makes Marty impossible to like but weirdly easy to follow on his twisted odyssey.\n\n-[Tim Grierson, Screen Daily](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/marty-supreme-review-timothee-chalamet-powers-josh-safdies-bracing-spin-on-the-sports-movie/5211372.article)\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**PLOT**\n\nA ping pong drama set in New York City during the 1950s where up-and-coming table tennis star Marty Mauser goes to hell and back in pursuit of greatness.\n\n**DIRECTOR** \n\nJosh Safdie\n\n**WRITERS**\n\nRonald Bronstein &amp; Josh Safdie\n\n**MUSIC**\n\nDaniel Lopatin\n\n**CINEMATOGRAPHY**\n\nDarius Khondji\n\n**EDITORS**\n\nRonald Bronstein &amp; Josh Safdie\n\n**RELEASE DATE** \n\nDecember 25, 2025\n\n**RUNTIME**\n\n149 minutes\n\n**BUDGET**\n\n$60-$70 million\n\n**STARRING**\n\n- Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as Marty Mauser\n\n- Gwyneth Paltrow as Kay Stone\n\n- Odessa A'zion as Rachel Mizler\n\n- Kevin O'Leary as Milton Rockwell\n\n- Tyler Okonma as Wally\n\n- Abel Ferrara as Ezra Mishkin\n\n- Fran Drescher as Rebecca Mauser",

I hadn't watched it since being a teen in that period, and it was fascinating to have that extra layer of \"this is the late 90's\", and have it feel authentic, moreso than something forced like Empire Records (1995), who just missed the end of grunge.\n\nI also watched Cocktail (1988) this summer, and it was fantastically 80's as a movie, and in the movie, obviously. Most reviews were meh, but obviously they were contemporary to the film and so couldn't fully grasp how gloriously 80's the whole thing was.\n\nAny other movies that live on for you as perfect time capsules of a moment in time?",
