I would expect the camera crew to be more jerky and suddenly stop if they are expecting to pan from him walking from the store directly to the car? Is it something they edited in post to make smoother, or they're just really good at smoothly following any unexpected action?",

It\u2019s still there, having survived the pandemic, when many of the enterprises on the boulevard in that area were boarded up, and were never to be re-opened again. When I peered in, The Frolic, where I used to hang when I first came to town, looked just as dark and divey as ever\u2014just perfect. For some reason, I nodded and the seated doorman, who I\u2019d never met, smiled and nodded back as if he sensed I had been a customer. \n\nThe Frolic has been used as a location for numerous movies, including A Woman Under the Influence (1974), From Hollywood to Deadwood (1988), LA Confidential (1997), and The Little Things (2021), among many others. Another one was Quentin Tarantino\u2019s ode to 60s Hollywood, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. It only appears briefly in the movie, but star actor Rick Dalton DiCaprio) drunkenly crashes his car outside the location. Moreover, folklore has it that the Frolic was one of the last spots that murder victim Elizabeth Short (\u201cThe Black Dahlia\u201d herself) visited\u2014being a regular denizen of the night on the \u201cboulevard of broken dreams,\u201d it\u2019s more than likely she partied at the Frolic. Personally, I\u2019ve shared a drink or two there with other \u201cprofessional\u201d drinking regulars like Harry Dean Stanton (RIP). Apparently, writer Charles Bukowski was also a regular there. Of course, he was. \n\nCheck out a little background on The Frolic Room, the oldest dive in Hollywood: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9jmCNiTDjQ\n",

        "content": "I'm going through a rough patch right now, and movies are the only thing that help me turn my brain off for a bit. But I don't just want something sad - I want those films that destroy you emotionally. The kind that make you cry not just for minutes, but hours or even days. The ones that sit in your chest long after they're over, that you can't get rid of no matter how much time passes.\n\nDon't worry about language or genre or release year - I don't care about any of that. I just want to feel something real again. What movie did that to you? \n\nHelp a friend who's in need - recommend me the films that broke you.\ud83d\ude42",

The idea is that we all vote on a movie to watch during the week, then hop on a voice call to talk about it, share thoughts, maybe dive into some film theory, or just nerd out about what we liked or didn\u2019t.\n\nIt could be anything: classics, new releases, weird arthouse stuff, or whatever the group feels like.\n\nI feel like there are a lot of us here who love talking about movies but don\u2019t always have people in real life who want to dig into cinematography, writing, soundtracks, and all that.\n\nWould anyone be interested in joining something like that?\n\nDM me for my discord if interested!!",
