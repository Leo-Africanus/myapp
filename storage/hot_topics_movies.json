I\u2019m Jenny Jue, casting director for The Wedding Banquet (now in theaters), Okja, Snowpiercer, Inglourious Basterds, The Brother's Sun, Netflix's Avatar: The Last Airbender season 2, and more. I love discovering breakout talent and building unforgettable ensembles. AMA!\n\nI'll be back at 8 PM ET today (Wednesday 4/30) to answer your questions. Ask me anything!\n\nView the official trailer for \u201cThe Wedding Banquet\u201d here: \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWy\\_IzW04YM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWy_IzW04YM)\n\nMy credits:\n\n[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1937563/](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1937563/)\n\nUp next: \"Untitled Avatar: The Last Airbender\" (Paramount/Avatar Studios), \"Mike and Nick and Nick and Alice\" (20th Century Studios), and \"Ballerina Overdrive\" (Amazon Studios).\n\nMore bio information:\n\nCSA Award-winning Casting Director Jenny Jue, whose two-decade career includes standout collaborations with Quentin Tarantino (\"Inglourious Basterds\"), Bong Joon Ho (\"Okja\", \"Snowpiercer\"), and Netflix\u2019s \"The Brother\u2019s Sun.\u201d\n\nJenny\u2019s latest project, \"The Wedding Banquet\" (Bleecker Street), is a 2025 reimagining of the Ang Lee classic, directed by Andrew Ahn and starring Lily Gladstone, Bowen Yang, Kelly Marie Tran, Joan Chen, and Youn Yuh-jung. Premiering to rave reviews at Sundance and in theaters nationwide April 18, 2025, the film explores queerness, chosen family, and generational identity with depth and humor. Jenny spent two years casting the project, navigating the unique challenges of post-strike independent filmmaking while shaping an ensemble that feels instinctive and human.\n\nJenny\u2019s path to casting was anything but conventional. Raised in Southern California by a family of engineers, she initially pursued a pre-law track at UCLA. But a last-minute internship with iconic casting director Johanna Ray (\"Mulholland Drive\", \"Twin Peaks\") changed everything. Jenny spent nearly a decade under Ray\u2019s mentorship before founding her own company, Downtown Casting, in 2012. Since then, she\u2019s become the go-to casting director for auteurs seeking global talent and emotional authenticity\u2014balancing the demands of prestige cinema with stories that feel intimate, lived-in, and often underrepresented. Her work spans genres, from the from the stylized action of \"Kate\" to the unsettling realism of the BAFTA-nominated documentary \"The Social Dilemma.\"",

        "content": "It is, as condescending as it may sound, the ultimate acting compliment for an amazing acting performance to stand out in a bad movie. If you as an actor are the one beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak ocean of mediocrity, you have done your job ten times over. \n\nSo, what are the best examples?\n\nI will die on this hill but Rami Malek as Freddy Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody absolutely deserved every single ounce of praise that he got. The movie as a whole is wildly inconsistent and definitely is not a great film especially in terms of honouring the legacy of a band as iconic and truly legendary as Queen, but Maleks performance I will to the hilt defend because he put everything he had into the portrayal. In a bad movie, he very much deserved his Oscar win. Fight me. ",

As we watched it, I picked up on something I hadn't noticed in previous viewings.\n\nThere is a scene where Drew Barrymore's character Lucy invites her dad and brother to watch *The Sixth Sense*, which is new to her but not them (due to her memory problems). When talking about it afterwards, Lucy says something like \"I can't believe Bruce Willis was a ghost the whole time!\", thus spoiling the ending of that movie. \n\nIt caught me off guard because it was so blatant. But that got me wondering: are there other examples of a movie spoiling a different, completely unrelated movie? ",

        "content": "rob zombie's 2003 horror movie house of 1000 corpses holds the dubious honor of being one of the very few movies in existence where many members of it's cast died before it turned 20 years old. before the film's 20th anniversary in 2023, 7 members of it's cast died. \n\nthe first was dennis fimple who was actually sick from heart disease at the time, hence why his character sits down for most of the movie. however, it was not the disease that claimed his life but a car crash in 2002. house of 1000 corpses would be fimple's final movie, releasing the year after his death.\n\nthen came matthew mcgrory, a man who is largely known for holding the guinness book of world records for the tallest actor, standing at 7 feet tall and 6 inches. mcgrory's career was relatively short with only a few film credits and television credits to his name. most people will likely know him as karl the giant from tim burton's big fish. it's worth noting that he was one of only 4 actors from house of a 1000 corpses to return for the film's sequel the devil's rejects, reprising his role as tiny firefly. the same year that movie came out, mcgrory would pass away from congestive heart failure at the age of 32. the devil's rejects is dedicated to his memory. \n\nthen came karen black, a woman who needs no introduction if you're a fan of horror. she stars in house of 1000 corpses as mama firefly, the matriarch of the firefly family. she did not return for the sequel the devil's rejects due to demanding too high a salary to come back. after house of 1000 corpses, she continued to get steady work in both film and television until her 2013 death from cancer at the age of 74.\n\nthen there was tom towles. towles was a character actor who broke out into mainstream success with his portrayal of otis in henry portrait of a serial killer. throughout his career, he starred in many different movies and tv shows. house of 1000 corpses wasn't even his final collaboration with rob zombie as towles later starred in the devil's rejects, halloween, and the fake trailer for werewolf women of the SS. towles died in 2015 at the age of 65 from a stroke. \n\nthen there was irwin keyes, an actor who took full advantage of his towering height to play larger then life characters. throughout his career, he starred in many movies of many different genres and played many different roles. in 2015, keyes died at the age of 63 from complications of acromegaly.\n\nthen there was sid haig, who despite his long career in both film and television is likely forever destined to be known as captain spaulding, one of the greatest killer clowns in film history. his performances as spaulding is often considered to be among the strongest parts of those movies. in september of 2019, haig died at the age of 80 from pneumonia. his final performance as captain spaulding was in 3 from hell.\n\nfinally, there was michael J pollard, a famous character actor who had been acting since the 1950s. he was known for playing quirky and off beat supporting characters. he had a respectable career and even earned an academy award nomination for best supporting actor for his role in bonnie and clyde. after house of 1000 corpses, pollard went into semi retirement, only making 2 more movies before his 2019 death from cardiac arrest at the age of 80. \n\nRIP to them all.",

        "content": "Alien and Aliens are both in my top 5 movies of all time (not a surprise very basic bitch choices) but one thing I tell people is that the real genius of Aliens was just the decision to switch up the genre/style of the movie. Obviously it was executed perfectly, but just the idea to do that seems insane to me. I haven't really been able to think of a movie series that did that today. Especially going from a slow-loomthing-methodical build up horror movie like alien to a non-stop action/horror/thriller in aliens.\n\nedit - By modern I'm gonna arbitrarily say like post 2005~",

You could argue he doesn\u2019t get to do anything that reaches into, say, DDL level emotion for There Will Be Blood for abandoning his child or De Niro smashing up a concrete wall in darkness in Raging Bull, but the scene where Murray reads Mozart\u2019s music for the first time is the best acting I think I have seen in a film. \n\nComes down to personal taste rather than anything objective I suppose.

Michael and the girl walk past the camera bashfully flirting, followed by a group of female relatives chaperoning and chatting amongst themselves, and then followed by two guys with shotguns. You can see the whole story of Michael's time in Italy in a single moment.\n\nIt's a great shot, and funnily enough I can totally see the resemblance to some shots in Fury Road -- where the camera kinda lingers and lets different characters and groups fall in and out of frame, in a way that tells an effective mini-story.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite shots that tell their own stories?",

It blows my mind on how everything went downhill after the release of BVS.\nI do however think it\u2019s fair to say, synder had a pretty good run with DC though. After seeing the new super man trailer today, I\u2019m excited to see what gun is going to do.\n\nif you seen the new trailer, what are your thoughts?",
