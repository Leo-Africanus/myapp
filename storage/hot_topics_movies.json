Regulars can recite the pre-recorded spiel that plays before a by heart: no talking, no texting, and keep your devices dark, silent, and\u00a0out of sight. That last point currently has customers up in arms.\n\nCurrently, any Alamo Drafthouse social media post\u2014no matter the subject\u2014is accompanied by an onslaught of comments about the theater's plan to kill its classic paper-and-pen ordering model and replace it with a QR code-based platform, effectively ending its longstanding \u201cno phones\u201d policy. The shift is seen as a betrayal of Alamo Drafthouse\u2019s promise of a viewing experience with limited distractions. People have called it a bellwether of staffing reductions. And what better way to justify the development cost of a new ordering platform than by cutting expenses?\n\nAlamo Drafthouse\u2019s current predicament notwithstanding, there is no reason a theater cannot implement mobile ordering technology without sacrificing its soul. In fact, another Texas-based chain has done exactly that over the past several years. ",

Her dream is merely a 5 minute drive away, but her reality is being stuck poverty and now going in and out of foster care.

        "title": "Joe Pesci",
        "content": "I just want to discuss Pesci's career. Pretty straightforward. I have a mild obsession because he was ubiquitous for about 8 years between the release of Goodfellas and Lethal Weapon 4, then he took that 12 year break before Love Ranch, then another 9 year break until he did the Irishman, then he got pulled out of retirement for random projects like Bupkis and Day of the Fight, etc. \n\nHe sold this house of his in, I think, New Jersey, a year or two ago and it was on public real estate web sites. I was fascinated by how early 90's it was. Everything in it was the height of luxury and state of the art entertainment from the early 90's, plus all his posters, etc. but it looked like he basically hadn't updated any of it from about 1994 on.\n\nI sometimes wonder about a career like his, where he made his mark and then went away- what could have been, or maybe this was perfect and he decided he wasn't gonna get the kind of roles to maintain his legacy so he walked away basically on top? \n\nOther actors who have done this have done it a bit more pretentiously, like Daniel Day-Lewis. \n\nAlso for all of Pesci's signature style as an actor, he truly has/had range that he rarely tapped into.\n\nI also realize he made a TON of money in his heyday. He was getting paid like $3M+ per film in the early 90's, the modern equivalent of $7M per film today, which, if your lifestyle is simple enough, would certainly be enough to retire from day to day work. He'd made around  $35M in early 90's money in about a 9 year span, which is like earning $80M-ish today.\n\nAlso did not realize he joined the Lethal Weapon franchise \\*before\\* Goodfellas! \n\nAnyway.... what are your thoughts on his career?",

It's one of those movies where you would say: this one is definitely in my top 3.\n\nFor me this is Poor Things (2023). Saw it last year, and I keep thinking about it. I think it was my first movie with Emma Stone. Really worth it to see in 4k HDR/DV, cinematography so gorgeous. Music so original. Definitely going to watch Yorgos Lanthimos (director).\n\nNoticeable mentions: One Battle After Another (2025) - Sean Penn is so good in this.",
