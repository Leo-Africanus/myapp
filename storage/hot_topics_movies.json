        "title": "I finally got around to watching Oldboy - and it was not the kind of movie I was expecting",
        "content": "It can sometimes be a little difficult these days to appreciate well-regarded classic cinema with truly fresh eyes and perspectives. Even if you haven't seen a particularly acclaimed movie, the prevalence of Reddit movie subs, YouTube move discussion channels and the popularity of Letterboxd means that you will almost inevitably absorb a lot of information on a popular classic just by osmosis. I think Oldboy definitely falls into this category of movies, where its towering reputation and sheer quantity of discourse in online film circles creates an almost outsized sense of expectation before you even start watching it. \n\nWhat I knew about Oldboy from said reputation was the following: dark, brutal, badass, iconic hallway fight scene, crazy twist and generally adored by young filmbro cinephiles. Going in, I kept my expectations in check as I thought I would probably get a dark, well-made revenge thriller and maybe not much more. \n\nBoy oh boy, was I ever wrong. I waited a bit to post my thoughts because after finishing the movie last night, I needed some time to process it, especially after those final 30 minutes.\n\nFar from being \"just\" a revenge thriller, Oldboy actually turned out to be a grand human tragedy, a dark and bleak narrative of entwined fate and cycles of love-hate-love.\n\nWhat stood out to me first and foremost is just how offbeat the whole atmosphere of it feels. Like it almost takes place in an off-kilter world just a bit removed from our own. The dark and moody visuals, with some truly inventive cinematography and shot composition, add to the overall atmosphere. The now-classic hallway fight scene is still amazing, and years of other media ripping it off hasn't really hurt it even a little bit. \n\nThe story is fantastic, and where I was impressed the most. I kinda had the impression that the narrative would be really about Oh Dae-Su finding the people that imprisoned him and getting bloody revenge, but it's truly compelling in the way it keeps adding new wrinkles to the plot and then finally pulling the rug out from under you in the final act. In fact, up until the 3rd act, the movie was more along the lines of good-to-great to me. It really gets elevated to another level though when you find out the truth.\n\nAnd man this was some dark, sick shit lol, just operatic and grandiose in its sheer twistedness. The discovery that this is all &gt;!actually Lee Woo-jin's revenge!&lt;, and not Oh Dae-Su's, and the sheer scope and extent of it, is breathtaking. A minor, careless sin committed by a clueless young boy that spiralled into a toxic ball of death and hate, consuming multiple lives into itself. It's rare that a movie will make me go \"holy shit\" these days, but Oldboy really managed it. It's not even the fact that &gt;!Oh Dae-Su was made to commit incest with his daughter!&lt;, but more everything that led to it. \n\nThere is no catharsis here. No satisfaction from a well-planned and executed plot of righteous vengeance. It just leaves you feeling dirty and emotionally drained. \n\nLee Woo-jin was just foreshadowing his own death in the end - revenge will heal you for a bit but the pain will never go away. You can cry and beg and self-mutilate all you want. The man walks away and the Monster remains. And Oldboy lives up to all of its hype. ",

Each film has to also not be so bad that it makes no money and justifies a sequel. I think Police Academy pulled this off, but most series will have a bounce back move (e.g., Star Trek 4)",

Actors who gave such an amazing performance that no one else could have played their role. \n\nOne that comes to mind is Jeff Bridges in The Big Lebowski. It helps that the role was written specifically with him in mind, but still. It is absolutely his most iconic role and for good reason. He is not playing a part in that film. He IS that character. He might just be playing himself, but he is so natural. As a matter of fact, another example of perfect casting lies within that movie as well, with John Goodman as Walter. I can\u2019t imagine anyone else playing that role. He is by far the funniest part of the entire movie. \n\nOther examples without making this post an essay:\n\nJ.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and Terrence Fletcher\n\nMatthew Lillard as Shaggy\n\nAl Pacino as Michael Corleone\n\nDaniel Day Lewis as Daniel Plainview",

        "content": "Never underestimate the ability of a good title to sell a film. And vice versa, a bad title can ward people off a movie as much as bad marketing or bad word of mouth. For example, William Friedkin's \"Sorcerer\" had the miserable luck of being released in the wake of the unexpected phenomenon that was \"Star Wars\", but it wasn't helped either by a title that many found quite misleading. People who expected a fantasy film with that title were surprised to find it was actually a new adaptation of \"The Wages of Fear\" and that \"Sorcerer\" actually referred to the name of a truck. (Friedkin later said he got the title from the Miles Davis album and that the \"sorcerer\" in question was the hand of fate.) So while \"Sorcerer\" had a bad hand dealt to it already, the title didn't help matters any.",
