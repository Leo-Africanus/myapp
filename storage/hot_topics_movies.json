Everyone is treating acting very serious in what is a wacky premise, don't get me started on the world building. It's just a shame that I never got to see a sequel and now with Bruce Willis' condition I don't think we will every see anything else related to this world again, which is kind of a shame.\n\nIf you were to ask me, the movie is 10/10 Super Green\n\nEDIT - I forgot to mention how great the **PRACTICAL** effect were in this movie. I do know they used a fair amount of CGI, but upon rewatch in 2026, this movies stands up to ANY sci-fi movie made today; and I think it will stand the test of time. I can't wait to be able to share this movie with my son in a few years.",

I've tried to rationalize it over the years, thinking Kilmer's shutout from Oscar consideration must've been the result of some funky AMPAS politics, because it sure as hell wasn't due to a lack of artistry or execution on his part.\n\nSome will argue that the field of Best Supporting Actor nominees was exceptional that year (Tommy Lee Jones won for The Fugitive),but Val's \"Doc\" stood toe to toe with the best of them, and he was deprived of a nomination altogether.\n\nThere's something about how he delivered the quietly violent \"Doc\" persona with charm, humor, and swag. I guess sometimes a great performance doesn't need a statuette attached to it to stand the test of time. ",

What are your favorite movies with great bonus features?\n\nI first got this idea (to re-up my physical library) when Sinners made their Black Sign Language feature available on HBO Max. Yes, ironically thats a streaming feature, but Im hoping its available on their ohysical Bluray. \n\nwhat other movies should I get physical?",

Since we can watch most films at home anyway, I want to choose something that is way better in big screen, the kind which is not as much fun to watch on laptop or TV.\n\nWhat would you recommend?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your suggestions. We have watched many movies from the list and totally agree with you, In the end we decided to go with 'Lawrence of Arabia'.",
