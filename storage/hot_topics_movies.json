I hear he is amazing, but somehow none of his movies have found there way to me, nor have I cared to seek them out.  So I would have to watch one of his movies for the sole purpose to see Daniel Day Lewis.  Which I am open to but just haven't gotten around to it.  How bout you?",

Revenge of the Sith was the first Star Wars movie I ever saw in theaters, and I still carry some memories with me from that experience. I still remember reacting to the opening aerial battle over Coruscant, and I was so loud that my then-best friend who was sitting beside me had to lean over to me and tell me, \u201cDude, be quiet.\u201d \u00a0I also remember after the car ride home, my grandmother, who has since passed away, called my cousin, my friend and I all \u201clittle Skywalker\u2019s.\u201d\n\nToday, I took my dad to see the 20th anniversary of Revenge of the Sith. He's the one I showed scenes to from all the Star Wars movies as a kid over and over and over, and he was the main one I had lightsaber fights with as a kid. He gave me new memories that I can carry with me from this theater experience. He always mimics Windu's face when he is lightsaber locked with Palpatine about mid-fight, he mouthed, \u201cDarth\u2026.Vader\u201d as Palpatine names him, and I noticed he side-eyed me when Anakin ignites his lightsaber in front of the Younglings.\n\nNow I have memories of old and new, and I had a very entertaining experience revisiting 2005 in 2025.",

With ever increasing shock value or whatever. In an attempt to be shocking and wacky is horrible.\n\nLike when there's two characters insulting another character and they alternate and scale up the the same insult, like: \n\n\"You look like a turd\" \n\n\"You look like turd that all the other turds don't like because you live in your turd-mom's turd-basement.\"\n\n\"You look like a turd that banged another turd and then had a turd baby out of its butt.\"\n\nEtc... they usually do five or six. I kept it to three.  They keep scaling up the same joke but are still saying the same joke over and over.  Yes, he's looks like turd haha. Let's move on.  \n\nThese are things that they used to do in movies and then pick the best one and use that in the movie and now they just leave them all in there and it's pathetic. \n\nWatching hot tub time machine 2 and they they keep doing this and then they're actually making references to the fact that they keep doing this which doesn't actually make it any funnier.  Hanging a lamp on laziness and stupidity is not comedy. \n\nJudd Apatow turned this into the regular and it's horrible. He's done some good stuff and it was fine that he was doing this in his movies. We don't need it in every other comedy movie made since. It's what comprised about 65% of the 2016 Ghostbusters movie's dialogue.  \n\nI want well-written comedy, not a brainstorming session on film.",

        "content": "So today I watched *Perfect Days* (Japanese movie) and honestly...I didn't expect it to leave such a strong impact.\n\nAt first, it feels so simple... just a guy living his everyday life, cleaning toilets, listening to old cassettes, taking pictures of trees. But the more you watch, the more you realize how much peace and depth there is behind his routine.\n\nOne thing that stood out to me was how he smiles at the sky every morning. Like he\u2019s genuinely grateful for another day. No rush, no complaints, just...existing with full heart.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t talk much unless necessary, but when he does interact (like with his niece or that random guy he plays shadow games with), you can feel how much he enjoys human connection too. He\u2019s not *avoiding* people...he just doesn't *need* noise to be happy.\n\nThere\u2019s this beautiful bittersweetness. He\u2019s not \"choosing loneliness\" in a sad way...it's more like, life took him down this path, and instead of fighting it, he embraced it with full acceptance. That\u2019s powerful in today\u2019s world where everyone feels pressure to chase something constantly.\n\nThe scene where his niece leaves... and he quietly cries...man, that hit different.  \nNot because he's weak or regretting, but because even the strongest hearts carry a little sadness somewhere deep.\n\nAnd that final drive...the way he smiles and then tears up while listening to music, that was pure *life itself*. Happiness, sadness, memories, gratitude...all flowing through him at once.\n\nHonestly gave me the same vibe I felt after watching Shawshank Redemption...the idea that freedom and peace are an inside job. No matter what life gives or takes away.\n\nOne of the most beautiful movies I\u2019ve ever watched without trying to be \"loud\" about it. I liked the whole silent treatment vibe\n\nAlso, I\u2019m surprised how not many people talk about this movie.\n\nWould love to hear what you guys felt after watching it.",

        "title": "How many of you guys still make it a point to go to theaters vs watch at home?",
        "content": "Ted Sarandos (Netflix CEO) recently gave an interview where he re-iterated how the theatrical model was outdated. So I thought I'd ask a sub of movie lovers. How many of you still enjoy going to the movies? Personally I still go when there's something that really peaks my interest. But current ticket prices have made me a lot more selective and obviously I tend to favor the big movies where the theatrical set up really shines vs the samller films that you can enjoy at home without missing much in terms of bigger screen and super duper sound set up. But, I do agree with the aspect that streaming has \"democratized\" the movie viewing experience. Not everyone lives close to a movie theater and not everyone has the time to go to one. Being able to press play and just enjoy is a huge plus. Also, home set ups are becoming more advanced. Some OLED and Mini LED tvs are out of this world in terms of quality and you can get a great sound system too. So I guess I'm 50/50 on this. What do you guys think?",

        "content": "The most common example iv noticed is when a character is looking forward and then looks down in the original shot. However it is then edited (reversed) to make it so the character looks up from looking down originally. \n\nPersonally i find it very obvious but have never understood the reasoning. Is it intentional to give a surreal/irregular feel? Or is it because they didn\u2019t have the shot they needed so just sort of butchered an already existing shot to fit the narrative? \n\nTheir eye movement and blink just its really unnatural but i\u2019v not seen any evidence or articles mentioning this besides a couple of Reddit posts asking the same thing. \n\nWhat prompted me to post this question was i noticed it on Nicholas Hoult\u2019s character in The Menu. If that helps the explanation of scene. \n\nI have included the shot in question, watch how his eyes flick. This is obviously reversed. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Rl7kq3N",

I casually read the description of the movie on HBO Max and thought it sounded interesting so I figured I\u2019d watch it and all I can say is wow. What a ride. The acting was also amazing but perhaps too much so because I\u2019m left feeling like I got shot in the heart but I guess that\u2019s what makes it a good movie.",

I haven\u2019t watched Wedding Crashers for years and I just fired it up this morning. I laughed so hard, it has just the right amount of awkward moments, fun dialogue, and Isla Fisher is absolutely amazing.\n\nNow I\u2019m putting Meet the Parents and There\u2019s Something About Mary on the re-watch agenda.",

We don\u2019t want to watch a cartoon or a documentary but something that feels adventurous or explorative would be awesome.  If it involves diving, that would be even better. We are huge fans of the guardian (coast guard movie) and think a movie with a rescue attempt would be great. Thank you so much.",
