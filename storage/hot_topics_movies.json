But most of its richest pleasures come down to Fiennes going balls to the wall with a truly memorable character \u2014 half lunatic and half visionary. He elevates the movie whenever he\u2019s onscreen.\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2026/01/28-years-later-the-bone-temple-review-nia-dacosta-ralph-fiennes-1236680553/):\n\n&gt;Key to this is Fiennes\u2019 commando performance, a *tour de force* with so few f\\*cks given that the film\u2019s astonishing, electrifying climax could put him back into the awards conversation with a part that couldn\u2019t be further away from *Conclave*\u2019s Cardinal Thomas. O\u2019Connell, too, confirms his villainous chops with a subtle variation on his *Sinners* role, playing a seductive but sick, delusional psycho who kids himself that he has the devil\u2019s ear.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2026/film/reviews/28-years-later-the-bone-temple-review-ralph-fiennes-1236630014/) (90):\n\n&gt;For genre aficionados, it\u2019s bold, mind-bending work which satisfies that so-often-frustrated craving: for a zombie movie with brains.\n\n[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/28-years-later-the-bone-temple-review?utm_source=bluesky,threads,twitter) (8/10):\n\n&gt;28 Years Later: The Bone Temple picks up the same plot but tells a very different story in a surprisingly funny, exceptionally brutal new chapter for the franchise.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/author/williambibbiani/) (84):\n\n&gt;Nia DaCosta\u2019s smart, freaky sequel zooms in on the ongoing battle between sense and senselessness until it finds strong, connective tissue between science and religion.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/28-years-later-the-bone-temple-review-1235172860/) (83):\n\n&gt;A strange, hysterical, and thrillingly audacious continuation of a saga about the nature of faith in a godless world, \u201cThe Bone Temple\u201d might appear to be a more traditional genre offering than its immediate predecessor, but don\u2019t be fooled by the fact that it wasn\u2019t shot on an iPhone: This is very much the part two that 2025\u2019s smartest and most humane studio horror movie deserves.\n\n[Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/28-years-later-bone-temple-movie-review-8108fc8e8882a28ef0a26fd9f187d92e) (88):\n\n&gt;There\u2019s plenty of good music in 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple, including Radiohead\u2019s \u201cEverything in Its Right Place\u201d and one of the most gloriously unhinged uses of Iron Maiden\u2019s \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d ever conceived. If the previous film had a Fellini-esque vibe, this one has punky, anarchic feel.\n\n[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/28-years-later-the-bone-temple/) (80):\n\n&gt;Simpler, but also bolder and bloodier, than its predecessor, The Bone Temple is a more-than-worthy sequel.\n\n[Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/horror-movies/28-years-later-the-bone-temple-review/) (80):\n\n&gt;Nia DaCosta turns things up to 11 with an energized take on the 28 Years Later world. Come for the gore but stay for the surprisingly frequent jokes and a pair of astonishing performances from Ralph Fiennes and Jack O'Connell, whose sadistic Jimmy Crystal is utterly hateful but always compelling.\n\n[The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/28-years-later-bone-temple-review-jack-o-connell-b2899743.html) (80):\n\n&gt;It\u2019s rich thematic territory for the series, and slowly amps up the audience\u2019s anticipation for the moment these two finally cross paths. When they do, it\u2019s spectacular and audacious.\n\n[Screen Daily](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/28-years-later-the-bone-temple-review-jack-oconnell-ralph-fiennes-fuel-blistering-horror/5212640.article) (90):\n\n&gt;Bold, bloody and blisteringly brutal, this exhilarating follow-up to last year\u2019s 28 Years Later grabs its audience by the throat from the off and never loosens its grip.\n\n[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/2074962/28-years-later-the-bone-temple-review/) (80):\n\n&gt;I left 28 Years Later nervous about what might come next. After The Bone Temple, I'm thrilled at the prospect of where this story could go. That's what I call progress.\n\n\\--------------------\n\nDirected by Nia DaCosta:\n\n&gt;Taking place after the events of the previous film, Spike (Alfie Williams) is inducted into Sir Jimmy Crystal's (Jack O'Connell) gang of acrobatic killers in a post-apocalyptic Britain ravaged by the Rage Virus. Meanwhile, Dr. Ian Kelson (Ralph Fiennes) forms a new relationship with potentially world-changing consequences.\n\nRelease Date: January 16",

        "content": "Holy shit. I just watched I Saw The TV Glow, and I barely even know what to say. I have never in my life been so moved by a movie before. I felt like I was on the verge of tears for the entire runtime. By the final scene, I couldn\u2019t hold them back, and tears were just streaming down my face and falling onto my shirt. I didn\u2019t know it was possible for a movie to encapsulate the queer experience so perfectly.\n\nThe target audience is obviously trans people, and I am not trans. However, I am lesbian and asexual. I have long since come to peace with being lesbian. I like girls, who cares? Not me. Being asexual is\u2026different. When you\u2019re not interested in sex in such a sex obsessed society, you\u2019re naturally going to feel wrong. Inhuman. And this movie evoked that feeling perfectly.\n\nThroughout the whole movie, there\u2019s such a feeling of unease. What you\u2019re seeing is not right, things aren\u2019t supposed to be this way. Nobody around you understands. So you push it down and down, until you can\u2019t take it anymore. That\u2019s why this movie is classified as horror. Not because of cheap jumps scares or gore, but the dread looming over you for 90 minutes. If you\u2019re a queer person, it\u2019s not just for 90 minutes. It\u2019s your whole life.\n\nI think that\u2019s why there\u2019s such middling reviews on this movie. Before actually watching it, I looked at the plot for and reviews of the movie. And yes, I did spoil the entire plot for myself. But that barely even mattered, because nothing in the world could ever spoil the experience of actually watching it for the first time for me. Anyways, the reviews. People either love or hate this movie. And I genuinely think it might come down to queer vs non-queer people. If you are straight, I honestly don\u2019t believe you can truly appreciate this movie. Of course, that\u2019s a generalization. But I Saw The TV Glow was made by a queer person, for queer people. That almost never happens.\n\nIn the end, whether the TV show was real or not doesn\u2019t even matter. I personally believe it is, but your interpretation of the story doesn\u2019t change the experience, or what it\u2019s actually about. This is a horror film about what it\u2019s like to be queer, and that feeling of wrongness that comes with it. It\u2019s not an eldritch horror like some people seemingly expected. But I\u2019m glad it\u2019s not. It means more this way. You can always watch another movie about eldritch horror. You can\u2019t watch another movie like I Saw The TV Glow.",

Volunteers like Rita, a resourceful but lonely young woman who does not fit in with her peers, are dispatched to help clean up and rebuild. But one day, Darol suddenly emits a deafening signal, and its surrounding fruit bursts, revealing hordes of creatures that quickly slaughter everyone. Rita makes a valiant attempt to escape but dies in the attempt. Then... she wakes up again, only to witness the same tragedy. And again. Stuck in an inexplicable time loop, Rita struggles until she meets Keiji, a shy young man who is also experiencing the loop alongside her. Based on the worldwide best-selling light novel and manga, ALL YOU NEED IS KILL is a thrilling and big-hearted vision of what it means to live for tomorrow.*\n\nCast: Ai Mikami, Natsuki Hanae, Kana Hanazawa, Mochugakusei, Hiccorohee\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 88% (9 reviews)\n\n2 reviews on Metacritic (one 80 and one 90)\n\nSome reviews:\n\nGregory Nussen, Screen Rant 6/10 - Kenichiro Akimoto's brisk film is a more faithful adaptation of Hiroshi Sakurazaka's book than Doug Liman's was, but what it gains in authenticity it loses in propulsion.\nhttps://screenrant.com/all-you-need-is-kill-movie-review/\n\nAlan French, Sunshine State Cineplex 9/10 - This is a must-watch experience for sci-fi fans, especially given the epic scope Akimoto delivers.\nhttps://sunshinestatecineplex.com/2025/08/04/fantasia-all-you-need-is-kill/\n\nAndrew Mack, ScreenAnarchy - The action sequences are amazing, and the main reason why you shouldn\u2019t miss this when the chance arises.

Wondering why an incredible actor/actress isn't \"bigger\" is like wondering why Steph Curry \"isn't a bigger star\".",

Dunno how I missed it when it came out.\n\nIt's available on Prime Video at no extra cost.  Excellent English language subtitles are provided in the film.  Running time is 150 minutes.  I was quite moved by the ending.  Very happy to recommend it.\n\n\\*Edited to remove incorrect comment about actual war footage.",
