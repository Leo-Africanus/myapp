We were just watching the Hans Zimmer concert DVD, and when they played themes from Batman, Inception, Interstellar, and some of his other classics, those brought back some great memories. But in the last five years, we honestly can\u2019t think of many films that gave us that same \u201cwow\u201d factor.\n\nThe only recent one that really stood out was Top gun 2. Outside of that, nothing else really comes to mind.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Have movies actually declined in quality, or are we just getting older and harder to impress?",

More dumb jokes. \n\nIMO they really did an amazing job bringing back the vibe of the originals. So freaking refreshing. \n\nLeslie Nielsen fucking crushed that role. \n\nLiam Neeson also crushed it.

At first I thought it was going to be a boring movie that I would watch just for the sake of watching a movie of his choice with him. But fortunately, Frailty is one of those \"few exceptions\". This movie is SO GOOD. I'm surprised it isn't more popular. The story was gripping, the pacing was certainly slow but never enough to be boring, the performances are great (RIP Bill Paxton), and the final twist was good too. I was completely in awe while watching it, I totally expected it to get worse at some point but it's actually really consistent in my opinion. I rate it as a 9/10, definitely one of the best movies of 2001 for me\n\nWhat do you think? Do you like the movie?",

I was having trouble remembering who played the porcupines so I had to look it up. Was delighted to see it was none other than Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara, which was of course perfect at the time and even more so watching it post Schitt's Creek!\n\nOne fact I did not expect to find was this banger on the Wikipedia page about Nick Nolte and his apparent extensive research. Probably just Wikipedia vandalism but would love to know if there is some kind of origin to this story?\n\nEdit: Not (really) Wikipedia vandalism after all: [https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/filmmakers-and-cast-discuss-over-the-hedge/](https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/filmmakers-and-cast-discuss-over-the-hedge/)\n\n(Thanks to u/dogdriving)",

        "content": "The stunts in this movie fucking rule. It's got everything from free running, to fights, to boss fights, set pieces, shit, there's a fucking tuktuk chase in it. How many action movies can you count where people chase eachother with tuktuks?!\n\n\nLike I said in the title what really makes this movie stand out to me is the fact that Tony's really hitting his opponents and it genuinely shows. The stunt guys are always wearing big wigs, hats, beanies, or layered clothing to hide the protective pads their wearing. It's nuts. The fight choreography is gorgeous in this, Tony Jaa's movement is so fluid and rhythmic, he really brought out the beauty of Muay Thai.\n\n\nThe story is also pretty decent, the simple story of a country bumpkin having to team up with a scummy city slicker to return hope back to their village is pretty cute.\n\n\nI think it's a tie for me between the fight club battles and the final fight for the best fight scene in the movie",

        "content": "Sorry if this post doesn\u2019t adhere to rules. I don\u2019t post on reddit almost ever and every subreddit has such different rules. Guess we will see if this acceptable lol.\n\nSo I love movies, shows, and film\u2014- I often watch hours long YT breakdowns and discussions of movies or shows that inspire or enrage or touch or intrigue me. \n\nAnyway, I am 32yo in the US working a min wage job basically and I just rewatched the film John Q (2002) for the first time since I was probably like, 14. Wow. \n\nI was disturbed to see how much nothing has changed in the positive with regards ti the US healthcare system and only gone down an even darker road with regards to our \u201cpay-to-play\u201d healthcare in the US\u2014 especially with regards to the public sentiment toward universal healthcare and insurance companies?!!? Oof. \n\nThis movie is a very good one in my opinion. The acting, anyway, plot aside, is phenomenal and so emotional. I googled it veeery briefly to try and find others like it and I realized that it\u2019s such a difficult \u201ctype\u201d of movie to necessarily look for more of\u2014 so I was wondering if others here might be able to direct me to what I\u2019m looking for.\n\nI would like to find more films that have major social and or political commentary, specifically toward pro-working class or \u201clower class to lower middle class\u201d people in the USA. I\u2019m sure I may have seen some of the ones that may be suggested for example ones that highlight the prison system, or about facing off against major corporations but please dont assume I\u2019ve seen any and please give me a great list. \u2026\n\nI am also interested in showing some movies I\u2019ve already seen and finding new ones to show some of my family and friends that may\u2026 benefit from looking at things from a wider and more humanist perspective. \n\nThank you in advance \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79\u2665\ufe0f\n\n",

        "title": "George C. Scott's Turned Down Roles",
        "content": "Here are the roles that George C. Scott turned down or was considered\n\n1966: How To Steal A Million (Role: David Leland) (Actor who got it: Eli Wallach) (Reason: Scott was hired for the role when Walter Matthau was deemed too expensive. Scott had been on the set for a few weeks before shooting began. However, on his first day of shooting, he didn't show up until after lunch, and director William Wyler decided to fire him. He was already finding it difficult to handle two heavy drinkers, Peter O\u2019Toole andHugh Griffith, and the prospect of a third was just too overwhelming. On hearing of Scott's removal from the production, Audrey Hepburn became quite inconsolable.)\n\n1967: In The Heat Of The Night (Role: Bill Gillespie) (Actor who got it: Rod Steiger) (Reason: Scott was offered and actually accepted the role of Bill Gillespie, However, according to producer Walter Mirisch's memoir \"I Thought We Were Making Movies, Not History\". Scott backed out when wife Colleen Dewhurst wanted him to direct her in a play on Broadway. So Mirsch offered the role to Rod Steiger and he accepted)\n\n1967: Wait Until Dark (Role: Roat) (Actor who got it: Alan Arkin) (Reason: Jack L. Warner wanted him for the role of Roat before deciding on Alan Arkin)\n\n1970: Catch 22 (Role: Colonel Cathcart) (Actor who got it: Martin Balsam) (Reason: Scott turned down the role, stating that he already played the part in Dr. Strangelove)\n\n1971: Dirty Harry (Role: Harry Callahan) (Actor who got it: Clint Eastwood) (Reason: Scott admitted in a 1980 Playboy Interview that he was offered the role of Harry Callahan but turned down the role because he didn\u2019t like the script\u2019s violent nature)\n\n1971: McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller (Role: John McCabe) (Actor who got it: Warren Beatty) (Reason: He was considered for the role when Elliot Gould turned down role and Warner Bros preferred him for the role, but Altman ultimately decided to cast Warren Beatty)\n\n1972: The Cowboys (Role: Will Anderson) (Actor who got it: John Wayne) (Reason: Was offered the role because Mark Rydell originally did not want to work with John Wayne, but John Wayne managed to convince him and Rydell admitted that he actually enjoyed working with John)\n\n1972: The Godfather (Role: Vito Corleone) (Actor who got it: Marlon Brando) (Reason: Scott was considered for the role of Vito Corleone)\n\n1972: Deliverance (Role: Unknown) (Reason: Scott was considered for a role in the film)\n\n1976: Network (Role: Howard Beale) (Actor who got it: Peter Finch) (Reason: Scott reportedly turned down the role of Howard Beale)\n\n1976: The Shootist (Role: J.B Brooks) (Actor who got it: John Wayne) (Reason: Scott was offered the role and reportedly he accepted the role on the condition that not word of the screenplay be changed but for reasons unknown, he didn\u2019t play the part likely due to John Wayne campaigning hard for the part)\n\n1999: Magnolia (Role: Earl Patridge) (Actor who got it: Jason Robards) (Reason: Scott was offered but turned it down after reading the script, calling it \u201cThe Worst f\u2014 Thing I\u2019ve ever read, the language is terrible)\n\n**I\u2019m Still on a George C. Scott binge. I must admit, I wish Scott did more films like Patton in the 1970s. After great performances in Anatomy Of A Murder, The Hustler, Dr. Strangelove in the 70s, Scott achieved what I think is his greatest performance in Patton. However I feel after Patton, his film roles left something to be desired. I do hear great things about The Hospital &amp; The Changeling and I did enjoy Hardcore, but when I see or hear of his other films in that era (Like Rage, The New Centurions, The Last Run, Day Of The Dolphin, Island Of The Stream, The Formula) , its \u201cGeorge C. Scott is great, even though the rest of the film is mid\u201d. I will say his television films are top tier, Jane Eyre, The Price, Beauty &amp; The Beast, A Christmas Carol, The Last Days Of Patton, 12 Angry Men Remake and others.**\u00a0\n\n**I still think George C. Scott is a legend but I do wonder what would happen if he accepted any of the roles he turned down. (The Godfather &amp; Deliverance are perfect castings, but I wonder on In The Heat of the Night, Network, The Shootist and Magnolia would have been an interesting if he accepted as it could have been his final film)**",
