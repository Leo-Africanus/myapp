Something about the type of villain that you could imagine really existing adds to the terror.",

So the first night it was released I drove over, and was thoroughly disappointed. \n\n\n\nMaybe my expectations were too high, but I just found so much in the movie unnecessary to the plot and just  an overall  boring experience. \n\n  \nWhat about you?",

While trying to keep her on the line, they do everything they can to get an ambulance to her. Her name was Hind Rajab.\n\nIt was one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen in my life, when the movie ended, people didn't even talk amongst themselves. All I could hear was a woman crying somewhere at the back and when the lights turned on, a lot of people, including me were just shell shocked or were crying next to their close ones. This movie should win an Oscar for best international feature, and if it does not then you it would be for a pretty obvious reason. If the movie is there in theatres around you. GO AND WATCH IT!!",
