        "content": "Donnie Darko's director's cut is something I could do without. The original cut was soooo good - everything was *just right* but in the DC they overexplain everything and kill the pacing of the movie somehow.\n\nOn another note, the Justice League 2017 sucked so bad it should have never been made, but ZSJL's stretched 4h+ runtime was just *okay*. Like, it's wayyy better than JL, but still not great. The story was so drawn out, and the slo-mo in every scene was just so uninteresting/uninspired (sesame seed falling from the trucker's burger, Lois putting down her coffee cup). As one reviewer put it, \"You could cut an hour without affecting the plot even a little.\" Also, why format a film for IMAX full knowing it would be released on the HBO streaming service. (Disclaimer: not hating on ZS, it's just my opinion)",

        "content": "Years ago when Imagine Dragons was at its peak of their popularity, everybody was using their songs in commercials and trailers (e.g. Friction for Mission: Impossible - Fallout and Warriors for Wonder Woman). But for some reason, someone thought that using Believer in the trailer Murder on the Orient Express (2017) was a good idea for a period piece mystery film, set in the 1930s.\n\nAnd that song did not work in the trailer at all. It was way too modern for a film set in the '30s and it was a weird song choice as well too for that trailer. That was definitely a weird moment during that period, before we even had slowed down songs in movie trailers.\n\nI give a special shout-out to Suicide Squad (2016) using Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody too and that was because the trailer was such a huge hit, WB hired the company that edited the trailer, to re-edit the movie as well. And it certainly didn't help the movie's quality at all lol.",

It\u2019s like everything happens at once. So maybe I\u2019m just identifying with him lately. ",

        "content": "The film was considered a major production in its time. $9 million to make, if I remember. Seems tame now.\n\nThe studios had really high hopes for it and it did good, but didn\u2019t take over the world the way Star Wars would, released less than a year later.\n\nEven though parts of it are clunky and dated, it\u2019s just unusual and detailed enough to remain interesting to some new audiences. I think will always maintain its cult status and be remembered as an example of what science fiction films looked like in the 1970s before Star Wars altered the genre forever (but Alien was close behind\u2026 things were changing fast).",

        "content": "Here's my list so far from modern movies:\n\n1. **Gluttony**: The Menu\n2. **Greed**: The Wolf of Wall Street\n3. **Lust**: Eyes Wide Shut\n4. **Wrath**: John Wick\n5. **Sloth**: The Big Lebowski\n6. **Envy**: Black Swan\n7. **Pride**: Whiplash\n\nI feel like my picks are a bit shallow and doesn't have too much depth within each of the sins as the base topic of the movie. There is also some movie that represent other things quite well but does not fit in the seven sins category such as Insomnia representing Guilt.\n\nWhat movie would you guys pick as the best representation for each sin?\n\nPS: Decided to not include Se7en in any of the list because its just too on the nose.\n\nEdit: Decided to do a thread best picks to compare with my original list:\n\n1. **Gluttony**:\n   * The Whale\n   * La Grande Bouffe\n   * Salo or the 120 days of Sodom\n2. **Greed**:\n   * Wall Street\n   * The Big Short\n   * Margin Call\n3. **Lust**:\n   * Immoral Tales\n   * Nymphomania\n   * In The Realm of The Senses\n4. **Wrath**:\n   * Oldboy\n   * Kill Bill\n5. **Sloth**:\n   * Schindler's List\n   * Trainspotting\n6. **Envy**:\n   * Amadeus\n7. **Pride**:\n   * American Psycho\n   * There Will Be Blood\n   * The Substance\n   * To Die For\n   * Oppenheimer\n   * Ex Machina\n   * Training Day",

        "content": "Hello, r/movies!   \n  \nMy name is Daniel. I'm a university student currently attempting to conduct some simple research on the preferences of people who go to movie theaters (or opt not to.) The goal of this group project is to ultimately try to design a solution to the problem of declining movie theater attendance, but right now we're focused on gathering information from stakeholders (that's you!) before we can even think about solutions.\n\nIf you wouldn't mind filling out a short google forms survey on your experiences, it would really help. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes.  \n  \n[https://forms.gle/QMBx4asW9WxtZ5Zq9](https://forms.gle/QMBx4asW9WxtZ5Zq9)\n\nIf you're interested, the course is *Innovation by Design* and this is part of a multi-phase semester-long project. The survey doesn't cover every possible topic or consideration because we're using multiple different methods to get a variety of information from different sources. So, if you think there's a really important point about this issue that isn't really covered by the survey, feel free to put it in the discussion. We can always use more feedback!\n\nThanks!",
