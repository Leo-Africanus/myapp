        "content": "Tarsem's wildly imaginative take on the dream sequence as primary storyline is brought to life in 2006's The Fall, starring a very young Lee Pace. Set in the 1920's, Pace plays a stuntman who undergoes an accident and ends up in the hospital. As he may never fully recover from his injury, his career as a stuntman is at risk of meeting an early ending. Playing surreal notions of photography and film transitions, Tarsem weaves a tale of heartbreak, nostalgia, and submlime beauty. Anchored by two moving performances by Catinca, the young girl in the hospital, and Lee Pace, this gem of a film initially premiered at Toronto International FIlm Festival in 2006, and subsequently received an award from the Berlinale in 2007. After years of being unable to watch digitally, Mubi has undergone a 4k restoration which is available to be watched now through their streaming service. Has anyone else seen The Fall? What do you think?",

Burdened, guilty, angry, looking for redemption, haunted by doing the \"right\" thing. And finding it by saving the man who paid him to take a dive, the man he probably hates most.\n\nWe never see the boxing match, though.\n\nDirector Quentin Tarantino is famous for writing genre mash-ups scripts with what would be the \"good\" scenes of two or three movies. So the scene where Ving Rhames delivers a monologue about how \"Pride never helps. it Only hurts?\" to Willis? Good scene: keep that in the movie!\n\nThe actual boxing match? We know what a boxing match looks like: don't need to show it.  \n  \nIt may also have been a matter of expense: Pulp Fiction was not a big-budget movie, and a boxing match means loads of extras and conditioning for Willis to look like a credible pugilist. \n\nAlso, one scene of boxing turns any movie into a \"boxing\" movie, and this was not at heart a boxing movie.\n\nWhat other scenes are critical to the plot but never make it onto the screen?",

(And again, it has to be different projects, so Jerry Orbach being a cop for hundreds of episodes of Law and Order doesn't count.)\n\nAnother example that came to mind is R.

        "title": "The Graduate (1967) - a funny and insightful portrait of youthful malaise",
        "content": "Just got around to watching this classic that many consider to be one of the greatest movies of all time. For me, it may not be quite at that high of a level but I did enjoy it a lot.\n\nI also seem to have had the wrong idea of what this movie is actually about - I was under the impression that this would mostly be just about a sordid affair guy between a young guy and an older woman, but really it's a character study of one of the most obnoxious and self-absorbed protagonists I've come across in a while. The affair is really just a side effect of that.\n\nDustin Hoffman is pretty fantastic as Benjamin Braddock, and it's equally compelling and aggravating to see him go from being this privileged, overachieving, successful young man everyone loves to being an obsessive, borderline stalker. The affair with Mrs. Robinson, which made the movie so iconic, is a surprisingly small part of the movie. It gets to the essence of who Ben is, or how I interpreted it anyway - a young man who has everything but still feels like he has nothing, especially real human connection. His brain just couldn't handle the complex feelings around the affair, which led to him pretty much dehumanizing Mrs. Robinson. But it's not like Mrs. Robinson is innocent either - she very much went out of her way to seduce a lost young man she knew she would be able to control as a way to deal with her own unhappy marriage, as a way to try and regain control.\n\nThe second half of the movie, once Elaine comes into the picture, was to me a little less compelling, as it's really missing Anne Bancroft's presence. It's definitely funnier though, and it's pretty satisfying to see Ben slowly having everything go wrong for him as he becomes steadily more and more unlikable and irritating, lost in his own self-centred obsessiveness. I absolutely *loved* the final shot though, with Ben and Elaine in the back of the bus, their smiles slowly disappearing as they realize what they've just done.\n\nUltimately the movie stood out as a compelling look into that strange little part of your life in your early 20s, once you graduate from university and the whole world lies in wait in front of you, overwhelming and with a million different directions to go into.",

        "title": "The French Dispatch (2021) is one of the most exceptional movies I have ever seen.",
        "content": "I should start by saying that I am very new to the film world and I have basically zero taste. I am not a bona fide \"film bro\". Even when I know a movie is good I usually have to have it explained to me as to *why* it's good. So forgive me if I am painting in broad strokes and praising things that aren't viewed as super exceptional in the movie world.\n\n---\n\nI just watched *The French Dispatch* (2021) and oh my God, it was *great*. It was amazing. Dear Lord, I can't even put it into words.\n\nI've met lots of people who really don't like Wes Anderson's movies and find them too full of themselves, so I decided to educate myself on his work a bit more. Last night I streamed *The Grand Budapest Hotel* (2014) which was phenomenal\u2014 almost worthy of a Reddit post itself\u2014 but tonight's feature of TFD was just out of this world. I feel high coming out of it.\n\nI wasn't kidding before when I said I don't know *why* I like films. I can't put my finger down as to why I was glued to my seat for the whole 1h48 runtime.\n\nThe nostalgia for a time when there was romance and nobility in the now widely-despised profession of journalism?\n\nThe trope of the \"tortured artist\" made actually interesting and not masturbatory?\n\nThe scene of the art auctioneers discussing what distinguishes an actual abstract artist from a phoney?\n\nThe sentimental depiction of the student pubs where I've squandered so much of my youth so far?\n\nThe ridiculous yet addictive dialog that I'm lowkey unintentionally emulating in this post?\n\nFull frontal female nudity/Chalamet with his cock out?\n\nI need some time to process this. This might be one of those movies that I need to watch a second time in order to fully understand it. But I'm totally hooked into the Anderson cult. *Asteroid City* (2023) and *The Phoenecian Scheme* (2025) both look really interesting (even though I hate Michael Cera). Any recommendations what I should see next?",

Spielberg's version of West Side Story.\nWell, I saw it and I liked it, despite having a 6.5 on Filmaffinity.\nThe pace is good, the script is quite acceptable, but the car chases are on another level. Lily James, by the way, looks gorgeous. I recommend it.\n\nHave you seen her? You like me? I would like to know your opinion.\nGreetings.",

        "content": "Tremors has always been a favourite of mine, but something I\u2019ve always appreciated about it, and rarely see mentioned, is how it shows women in an unusually strong and positive way, especially for an early nineties film. Rhonda is shown straight away to be the smartest person in the group, but not in a cringy or overdone way, and it\u2019s never questioned or undermined. Val, Earl, and everyone else just accept it and keep looking to her for advice.\n\n\"What's it doing, Rhonda? Why do you keep asking me?\"\n\nThere\u2019s the usual romantic plot, but it doesn\u2019t take away from her role. Even the romance sidesteps the usual clich\u00e9s. There\u2019s a scene where Val cleans Rhonda\u2019s wounds and her legs are clearly unshaven \u2014 of course they are, she\u2019s been out in the desert doing research and shaving isn\u2019t exactly a priority. He doesn\u2019t care at all. The fact that it\u2019s even shown feels unusual. For a big mainstream creature feature in the early nineties, that was rare.. anyways I just find it refreshing and think the movie has aged remarkably well!",
