(One exception, an exchange between young Thomas and billionaire Owen about what it\u2019s like to be obscenely rich, stands out). By the time it concludes with the inevitable hinting at potential sequels, *Fountain of Youth* just seems desperate in its attempt to launch a viable film franchise for its streaming host.\n\n[The Wrap - William Bibbiani](https://www.thewrap.com/fountain-of-youth-review-john-krasinski-natalie-portman-apple/)\n\n&gt;It would be nice to report that \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d is harmless fluff, a brisk escapist adventure with a game cast and a few fun set pieces. And I suppose it may be mostly harmless, unless you count wasting your time as a \u201charm\u201d (and I wouldn\u2019t fight you on that). But it\u2019s annoying fluff. It\u2019s tedious fluff. The only thing I wanted to escape was the movie itself. The cast is either trying too hard or not enough, and none of the action sequences blew me away. There\u2019s a bit on a boat that was probably expensive. There\u2019s a fight in a library that\u2019s competent. There\u2019s a shootout at the pyramids between characters we don\u2019t know or give a damn about. There\u2019s a big difference between \u201cfluffy\u201d and \u201cempty.\u201d \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d seems to have found it.\n\n[The Daily Beast](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2345) \\- [Nick Schager](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/nick-schager)\n\n&gt;No matter his gifts for tales about motley crews, this sub-Spielbergian venture isn\u2019t in his rough-and-tumble wheelhouse, the result being a clunky farce that never escapes its ancestors\u2019 shadow.\n\n[Guardian](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/205) \\- [Ryan Gilbey](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/ryan-gilbey) \\- 2/5\n\n&gt;A movie as derivative and uninspired as this will always be surplus to requirements so long as the first three Indiana Jones movies remain in circulation.

        "title": "Gary Oldman should have won an Oscar for Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy",
        "content": "Gary Oldman, one of the greatest actors of our time, and maybe of all time, rightfully won an Oscar for playing Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour (2017), but he should have actually won one six years before for his performance as George Smiley in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011), instead of Jean Dujardin in The Artist, a mediocre movie and performance no one remembers about.\n\nIt's a masterclass in subtlety and restraint. Portraying the quietly brilliant British intelligence officer, he delivers a deeply internalized performance that departs from the more expressive roles he's known for. \n\nOldman uses minimal facial expressions and dialogue to convey Smiley\u2019s intelligence and emotional complexity. \n\nHis stillness and silence become tools of tension; much of his performance lies in glances, pauses, and barely perceptible shifts in posture. \n\nThis restraint mirrors Smiley's role as a careful observer in a world of deception.\n\nHe disappears into Smiley. \nHe doesn't rely on prosthetics or accents; it's a performance built on deep character understanding and emotional nuance.\n\nOldman plays Smiley as an observer, a man who listens more than he speaks. His performance is quiet but powerful, defined by subtle glances, slight changes in expression, and long silences. \n\nThis suits Smiley, a spy who works in shadows and survives by reading people rather than confronting them.\n\nHe drastically altered his posture and movements to embody Smiley\u2019s meekness. He moves slowly, deliberately, with minimal expression, embodying a man who has spent his life concealing emotion and intention. His voice is soft and even, conveying control and precision.\n\nOne of the most remarkable aspects is how he conveys Smiley\u2019s emotional depth, his disappointment, betrayal, and loneliness, without overt sentimentality.\n\nThe scene where he recalls his one confrontation with Karla (without ever raising his voice) is especially poignant, showing vulnerability beneath layers of professionalism.\n\nHis voice is calm, measured, and deliberate, which helps create an air of quiet authority. \n\nOldman modulates his tone so that even the smallest changes register as significant, drawing the audience into Smiley\u2019s methodical thought process.\n\nAlso he portrays Smiley as a man weathered by decades of espionage, with visible fatigue and emotional distance. \n\nHis physicality, stooped shoulders, slow gait, and a distant gaze, reflects the emotional toll of betrayal and long-term isolation, both personally and professionally.\n\nPerhaps Oldman\u2019s greatest feat is how much he doesn\u2019t say. In many scenes, Smiley simply listens, yet he dominates the frame. Oldman\u2019s controlled stillness contrasts with the chaos around him, drawing the viewer in and underscoring Smiley\u2019s intellect and detachment.\n\nThe character of Smiley is torn between duty, personal loss (his wife\u2019s infidelity), and his disillusionment with the Cold War\u2019s moral murkine.\n\nThough emotionally guarded, Smiley\u2019s pain, particularly regarding the infidelity and the betrayal within the Circus, is palpable in Oldman's nuanced reactions. \n\nThere\u2019s a quiet sadness beneath the surface, making his moments of vulnerability (such as the brief flickers of emotion when discussing Karla or his marriage) particularly poignant.\n\nEvery gesture feels calculated, aligning with Smiley\u2019s role as a master spy. Oldman\u2019s control over his performance mirrors Smiley\u2019s control over his surroundings, underscoring the tension in a film where much of the drama unfolds beneath the surface.\n\nOldman's performance is a rare instance where less truly becomes more. \n\nHe fully inhabits Smiley, not by overt displays but through a deep understanding of the character\u2019s inner world. \n\nIt stands as one of his most disciplined and critically acclaimed roles. \n\nHis portrayal defines the tone of the film, quiet, cerebral, and hauntingly introspective.\n\nOften big, showy performances get the acclaim and all the attention, but Oldman's work is the opposite, it's a rare example of how powerful restraint can be. Few actors could make such a quiet character so compelling.\n\nHis portrayal of Smiley demonstrates that great acting doesn\u2019t always need to be loud or showy.\n\nIt earned him an Oscar nomination and cemented Smiley as a hauntingly real character, an actual human being who could walk out of the screen, one whose intelligence and sorrow are etched not in his words, but in his eyes and silences.\n\nI think in the future it will end up being recognized as his greatest and most complex performance ever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "title": "The World Needs More Movies Like Ladyhawke",
        "content": "If you haven't seen Ladyhawke, you should watch it so that you know I'm right. Basically, it's a medieval fantasy romance which we're introduced to as a revenge quest in which one of the cursed lovers seeks vengeance against the bishop who cursed them. It stars Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfeiffer as the lovers and Matthew Broderick as the POV character that ushers us from the normal world of a medieval prison escape to the magical curse. Also, Leo McKern and John Wood. Plus a small role for Alfred Molina.\n\nLadyhawke is somewhat notorious for its \"synthrock score\" but honestly you barely notice it. Except when you do because it's awesome. But other than that, quite genuinely, this thing you'd think would intrude, doesn't.\n\nSo, why does the world need more Ladyhakwes? It's an original, high concept story that delivers on the premise of that concept. It's not trying to trick you, to pretend it's anything other than it is or subtly mocking you for taking the high concept at straight value. But nor is it overwrought and consumed by its own sense of seriousness -- there's colour in this world! Also, Broderick's character is a case study in how to provide quip-adjacent humour that feels genuine to the situation his character is in. Ladyhawke wasn't ahead of its time or anything but that's sort of the point I'm making.... it's a window into a different, more sincere world, that still knows how to laugh.",
