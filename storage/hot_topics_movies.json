        "content": "#Welcome to Oscar Bingo XII. I'll be your host, [LiteraryBoner](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/3/well-dressed-animal-10-lizard-matthias-hauser.jpg). For over a decade now we keep coming back to this silly game in which **YOU, the users** suggest things that might actually happen at the live ceremony of the Academy Awards. Then our friends over at www.print-bingo.com create us a game card generator so we can all play in real time on March 2nd.\n\nOkay, let's get in to it!\n\n* [Last year's submission thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1b3c4fv/official_oscar_bingo_submission_xi_thread/)\n* [Last year's card pickup thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ba54d1/oscar_bingo_game_card_pickup_thread_xi/)\n* [Last year's game thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1bbnpzr/oscar_bingo_game_thread_xi/)\n* [List of nominees for this year](https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2025)\n\nHere's how it works!\n\n**Submit ideas for things that might happen during the Oscars.**\n\n* **Max 80 characters** as to fit on in the bingo squares\n\n* Do **NOT** put more than one submission in a single comment. That cannot be voted on properly and will be removed. \n\n* Live ceremony only, no red carpet or off camera awards\n\n* Predicting specific wins, such as Emilia Perez wins Best Picture, will not be considered as they limit possibilities (And who wants to wait until the final five minutes to get a Bingo?)\n\n* Please try and keep submissions within reason and not too specific. \n\n* Use the list of presenters to try and guess what the bits or featured films will be!\n\n* This thread will be randomized and votes hidden. If there's lots of suggestions be sure to refresh a few times or scroll for a bit to spread the love!\n\n**Once we have collected submissions for a couple of days, we will un-sticky the thread and start to make game cards with your suggestions. Our friends over at *www.print-bingo.com* will again be doing some specialty work with us for this.**\n\n* We will post a gamecard pickup thread the Friday before the Oscars (the 28th). All you will have to do is follow the link in the thread, do the captcha, and a small link will appear to your gamecard PDF. \n\n**We'll post the game thread Oscar Sunday. The point of the Game Thread is to discuss game related things and for me to make final decisions on the more open to interpretation squares. It will be stickied as will all these threads.**\n\n---\n\nHost:\n\n* Conan O'Brien\n\nList of presenters:\n\n* Robert Downey Jr.\n* Da'Vine Joy Randolph\n* Cillian Murphy\n* Emma Stone\n* Halley Berry\n* Penelope Cruz\n* Elle Fanning\n* Whoopi Goldberg\n* Scarlett Johansson\n* John Lithgow\n* Amy Poehler\n* June Squibb\n* Bowen Yang\n* Joe Alwyn\n* Sterling K.

I thought it would be another generic action flick, but it turned out to be one of the best sci-fi movies I\u2019ve ever seen.

        "content": "I\u2019ve noticed a neat little trick Steven Spielberg uses in his movies, starting with\u00a0*Jurassic Park*. There's a scene where Alan Grant is having raptors explained to him, while in the background, John Hammond is having a separate conversation. Both conversations are audible, but as the audience, you naturally focus on Grant\u2019s, which is more relevant to the plot. This layering of dialogue makes the world feel more lived-in, like we\u2019re overhearing real people rather than just following a scripted exchange.\n\nIn\u00a0*Saving Private Ryan*, that moment with the translator, Upham, works similarly. His nervous, clumsy energy contrasts with Captain Miller\u2019s (Hanks) composed discussion, reinforcing their dynamic. The overlapping dialogue makes it feel like you\u2019re eavesdropping rather than being spoon-fed exposition, adding a level of realism that pulls you deeper into the scene.\n\nSpielberg does this in\u00a0*Jaws*, too\u2014think about Brody, Hooper, and Quint talking over each other on the boat. The chaotic energy makes their interactions feel natural and unfiltered, pulling us deeper into their world.\n\nIt\u2019s such a clever way to enhance immersion without drawing attention to itself. Has anyone else noticed this in his other films? Would love to hear more examples!",

        "content": "Who watched First Blood and suddenly decided it would be the ideal start for the beginning of a patriotic, war celebrating, franchise. How did John Rambo go from being a traumatized Veteran, tormented by his past and turned into a social avenger after being mistreated by bullying cops, to a loyal war mercenary, serving orders from army officials and fighting the Russians? \n\nI watched First Blood Part II in disbelief. Apparently, Ronald Reagan liked the Rambo sequels which doesn't put these films in a positive light. \n\nPart II wasn't even good. The point of the first film was a critique of fascism, of how veterans are not taken care off and become social outsiders bcause the Government refused to do its part. Part II almost completely forgot what the first film said, didn't get John Rambo is not G.I. Joe and basically turned the sequels into the antithesis of the crux of the original. Part II is generic, formulaic and violent. Some scenes are as cringy as any Chuck Norris' war film. Julia Nickson as Cao exists solely as the foreigner who yearns to be saved by an American.

        "title": "February 21-23 Box Office Recap: Despite repeating at #1, 'Captain America: Brave New World' collapses 68.3%, the third worst second weeekend drop in the MCU. Meanwhile, 'The Monkey' opens with $14 million, the second best debut in Neon's history.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/xec8micb16le1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc9aaf2ff9ae07e359ef5b9d59ed8b9fd2eb6025\n\nWell, the inevitable happened. ***Captain America: Brave New World*** was still on the top spot, but it had one of the worst MCU second weekend drops. Neon decided to release ***The Monkey***, and it deliver their second biggest debut ever. The other newcomer was Zachary Levi's ***The Unbreakable Boy***, which unsurprisingly bombed.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $71.1 million this weekend. That's up 38.6% from last year, when ***Bob Marley: One Love*** repeated atop.\n\nRepeating in the top spot, ***Captain America: Brave New World*** added $28.1 million this weekend. That represents a brutal 68.3% drop from its opening weekend. That's the third worst drop in the MCU, behind ***Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania*** (69.9%) and ***The Marvels*** (78.1%). This drop is insane, considering there wasn't much competition this weekend. But it's a sign that its weak word of mouth is already spreading.\n\nThrough ten days, the film has made $141.1 million. Its opening weekend was $18 million behind ***Quantumania***, and now its numbers are $26 million behind. That gap is only gonna get wider. $200 million is dead for this film, and it could also miss $190 million at this point. That's gotta hurt.\n\nDebuting in second place, Neon's ***The Monkey*** earned $14 million in 3,200 theaters. This is Neon's second biggest debut ever, just behind ***Longlegs*** ($22.4 million). Kinda crazy to think Osgood Perkins now has the top 2 debuts for Neon. It's also the best horror debut of 2025 so far.\n\nAll in all, this is a great start. Neon mounted a very successful marketing campaign, which was reportedly relying on digital ads. While horror titles often cost $40+ million to market, Neon kept things simple: they spent just $10 million in prints and advertising. A sign that a film doesn't need to spend a lot on marketing to open this high. Neon also emphasized the connections to ***Longlegs***, which was a smart call, and also highlighting Stephen King's involvement. Reviews were also good enough (78%) to convince others in giving this a chance.\n\nAccording to Neon, 58% of the audience was male, and 65% was 25 and over. They gave it a very middling \"C+\" on CinemaScore, which is also the same score for ***Longlegs***. That's not a death sentence for a horror tho; generally, these titles land in the C range. There's a lack of horror till ***The Woman in the Yard*** in late March. It won't hit ***Longlegs***' domestic total, but it should still hit $40 million, which is a big win for Neon.\n\nSony's ***Paddington in Peru*** added $6.5 million this weekend. That's a 49% drop, which is steeper than both prior films. Through ten days, the film has amassed $25.2 million and it's probably gonna miss $40 million if it continues dropping like this.\n\nDreamWorks' ***Dog Man*** dropped 40%, adding $5.8 million this weekend. That's still quite rough for an animated title. The film's domestic total stands at $78.7 million, and it looks like $100 million might be out of reach.\n\nIn fifth place, ***Ne Zha 2*** fell 59%, adding $3 million this weekend. Through ten days, the film has earned $14.8 million, but again, this market is not truly important for the film.\n\n***Heart Eyes*** had a boost last week thanks to Valentine's Day, but that's pretty much over. The film collapsed 73% this weekend, earning $2.7 million. The film has made $26.6 million, and it won't make it much further than $30 million.\n\n***Mufasa: The Lion King*** dropped 40%, adding $2.5 million this weekend. The film has made $245.4 million so far.\n\nIn eighth place, Lionsgate's ***The Unbreakable Boy*** debuted in 1,687 theaters, where it flopped with just $2.3 million this weekend. That's not a surprise, given how long it took the film to escape development hell; this was filmed back in 2020. Even with an \"A\" on CinemaScore, it's unlikely it lasts long in theaters. Another L for Zachary Levi.\n\nThe Indian film ***Chhaava*** added $1.5 million this weekend, which was just a 21% drop. The film has made $4.8 million so far.\n\nRounding up the Top 10 was Sony's ***One of Them Days***, which dropped 53%, grossing $1.3 million this weekend. With a $45.9 million domestic total, the film has now amassed a 4x multiplier. Truly impressive.\n\n***Love Hurts*** indeed. The film collapsed 74%, earning just $1.1 million this weekend. The film has earned a meager $14.5 million, and it doesn't have much gas left in the tank.\n\nQuiver Distribution released Martin Campbell's action thriller ***Cleaner*** in 378 theaters, and unsurprisingly, it flopped with $403,560. It will disappear quickly.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Captain America: Brave New World*** added $35.3 million this weekend, for a $289.5 million worldwide total. That's a steep 60%, and its numbers are $75 million behind ***Quantumania*** through the same point. The best markets are the UK ($16.7M), China ($13.5M), Mexico ($10.7M), Korea ($9.1M) and France ($8.9M). Without any other markets left, it looks like the film will struggle to hit $400 million worldwide. That's flop territory.\n\n***Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy*** has now hit $72 million overseas. The best markets are the UK ($34.5M), Australia ($6M), Poland ($4.2M), Netherlands ($3.3M) and Spain ($1.9M). And it still has some big markets left.\n\n***Paddington in Peru*** added $7.7 million this weekend, and the film has crossed $150 million worldwide.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Nosferatu* | Dec/25 | Focus Features | $21,652,560 | $95,608,235 | $178,719,280 | $50M\n*Wolf Man* | Jan/17 | Universal | $10,897,495 | $20,707,280 | $34,383,593 | $25M\n\n- It was time for ***Nosferatu*** to turn off the lights in the Krusty Krab. The film has closed with a fantastic $95 million domestically and $178 million worldwide, easily becoming Robert Eggers' highest film. Just wonderful. Wonderful all around. Focus wants to stay in business with him, which is why they greenlit ***Werwulf*** for Christmas Day 2026.\n\n- Hey, we were just talking werewolves, what a coincidence. Universal/Blumhouse's ***Wolf Man*** has closed with a terrible $20.7 million domestically and just $34.3 million worldwide. That's a pathetic 1.90x multiplier, and it's crazy to believe it only made it to just four weeks in theaters. Blumhouse is known for printing money, but this was the rare theatrical flop. Leigh Whannell was unable to replicate the success of ***The Invisible Man*** here. The final nail in the coffin: ***The Invisible Man*** made more in its opening weekend ($28.2 million) than what ***Wolf Man*** did in its domestic lifetime. Ouch.\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nWith the Oscars on Sunday, there's just one single wide release this weekend. And it may struggle to hit $10 million.\n\nIt's Focus Features' ***Last Breath***, which stars Woody Harrelson, Simu Liu, Finn Cole, and Cliff Curtis.

        "title": "The Empty Man - The Horror of Existence",
        "content": "A month ago I decided to check out The Empty Man (2020).  It was an overlooked movie and honestly fron the description it sounded like another run of the mill horror movie overlooked during COVID.  I was surprised to be wrong about that assumption.\n\nThe movie starts off in the mountains of Bhutan where a group of hikers encounter an entity on the mountain that possesses one of the group, and leads to the destruction of all involved.  Its a 20 minute cold open that raises many questions and answers none, giving us a purposeful set up to the rest of the movie, one that isn't understood for most of the runtime.  But it allows for an almost shocking setting change from a mountain range in Asia to the suburbs of a major US city.\n\nWhat plays out next feels, at first, like a run of the mill urban legend, mythological killer type movie. Our main character is an ex-cop who is investigating the disappearance of the daughter of a woman he had an affair with right before his wife and son died. She and her friends learned of the legend of the empty man: it you find an empty bottle on a bridge and blow into it while focusing on the Empty Man, he will appear. Over the course of 3 days you will see him more and more until he takes you.  As he slowly follows the clues to this mystery he begins to discover a connection to a cult who is invested in creating tulpas in order to harness the power of The Empty Man.\n\nWhat entails is an existential Lovecraftian nightmare, something that forces are main character to question the reality we live in and what evil entities exist just behind the veil.  It examines the ideas of identity, truth, free will and sacrifice over the back drop of those entities that wish to control those very ideas in order to use us.\n\nThe end is quite the revelation and takes a stunning turn that throws everything into question that we know about this world we've been introduced to. Unlike many plot twists that ruin the previous portions of a movie when rewatched (Im looking at you LongLegs), this sudden realization actually seems to work on rewatch, and makes it all the more interesting to dissect the movie on future viewings.\n\nAdd to that the direction, cinematography and shot composition are beautiful. The slow pace over the course of 2 hours and 20 minutes allows the the movie to take its time introducing its ideas and slowly unraveling a mystery that you become more invested in with each revelation.\n\nThis is definitely an overlooked movie. I can't find much information on it in general, nor many opinions on it.  I have to recommend it and also hope to hear some thoughts from those of you who may also have enjoyed this movie.\n",

        "content": "I was pleased when Gene Hackman won the Academy Award because  Bill Daggett isn't a easy character because of his complexity as an amoral character, he's someone who's trying to end the problem by not bringing justice against the men who scarred a local prostitute, because he's afraid of the impact it will degenerate, yet the more he insists on going after the vigilantes the prostitutes pay for, the more cruel and psychotic he becomes, getting to the point you just realize he's a bad guy. \n\nYes, you do see Bill is problematic early on, when he shuts down Alice (Frances Fisher), and he gets worse and worse. The glee he gets from torturing English Bob (Richard Harris) and Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) is where you truly see the monster he is. \n\nIt's also curious how Will Munny (Clint Eastwood) is the former murderer who is reformed and is currently a widowed family man who has enough empathy to comfort Delilah (Anna Thomson), the victim of the slashing, whereas Bill Dagger, the law of the land, is sparing criminals and killing anyone who tries to avenge the victim of a knife attack.",

I know acting out a phone call convo can be a lot harder than one might think. But I always thought that scene wasn't very convincing. You could tell the phone call was fake and I just thought Bruce Willis could have done much better.\n\nThe example I listed is just my opinion of course but does anyone else have any other examples of what I'm talking about here. Scenes that stood out. Scenes that you weren't really sold on. Where you thought the actor was not really dialing it in ?",

Do you just get your favourites or things you\u2019ve seen before or do you take a risk and buy stuff you\u2019ve not seen before as well. \n\nAre you religiously buying one format or not really bothered? Only firsthand or don\u2019t mind second hand? \n\nI tend to try and get my favourites on blu ray but am more than happy to get a lot of other stuff on DVD, secondhand often because it\u2019s fairly cheap and you can get a good amount for that. Bar a few things where I really prefer to get a certain format or edition I\u2019m not too fussy. So would love to hear how you guys buy ",
