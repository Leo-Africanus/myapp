I don\u2019t know that I want to recommend it, due to the sheer emotional kick in the nuts, but on the other hand it\u2019s a masterpiece so yeah, if you haven\u2019t seen it, do yourself the dubious favor and do it. \n\nEdit - thank you for the soul-destroying suggestions.

        "content": "Apologies if this question was asked, I don't know how to search for it.\n\nObjectively, yeah they're some master classes in filmmaking. S grade on everything: cinematography, acting, music, writing, directing, nothing more to be said, they're masterpieces of film.\n\nTheir statuses are well-deserved but I feel like it puts people nowadays off, makes everyone who hasn't seen them speculate about what makes them the GOAT. Maybe they think they're some boring art films, maybe they're highly nuanced and complex movies they're too tasteless and film-illiterate to \"get\", maybe they'll watch other movies before they could be cinema-literate enough to see why The Godfather Parts I and II are considered the greatest. At worst, they're the movies of people who are like \"I have good taste in film\". Then maybe they actually do watch but they either over-analyze and overthink everything on their first watch or they think nothing exciting really happens in this so-called Greatest Of All Time.\n\nI'd much rather not call these movies the greatest; rather I prefer to call them \"essential viewing for anybody who likes watching movies\" and even then, I think of them more like Rorschach tests. Perhaps they'll like it, perhaps not, perhaps it sticks with them, perhaps they'll forget it as soon as the credits stop rolling. What I think is essential is that if they like watching movies, The Godfather films should be among them, at least just once just to have an opinion on them.\n\nBut IMO they're really best watched just as another movie without titles like Essential or Greatest Of All Time. Maybe you're in the mood for a crime movie? Or you feel like watching a 70s movie or period piece? Or maybe you like Al Pacino? Or it's just a rainy Sunday with nothing else to do? I think that's the best way to watch The Godfather, as long as it's not just background noise while you do something else (and even then, you might catch a glimpse and be engrossed enough to stop what you're doing and watch!) because they're not revolutionary mindblowing pieces of art enjoyed only by the most cerebral; they're just really well-made movies. Watch and see if you like them or not. The dissection and analysis can come later or not at all.",

I've watched a lot of movies in the last 48 years and boy they do take the cake.\n\n in case you don't know the plot of Casino: \n\nIn early-1970s Las Vegas, low-level mobster Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein (Robert De Niro) gets tapped by his bosses to head the Tangiers Casino. At first, he's a great success in the job, but over the years, problems with his loose-cannon enforcer Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), his ex-hustler wife Ginger (Sharon Stone), her con-artist ex Lester Diamond (James Woods) and a handful of corrupt politicians put Sam in ever-increasing danger. Martin Scorsese directs this adaptation of Nicholas Pileggi's book.",

Of course, like many, I saw them back in high school\u2014but watching them now, with fresh eyes and a bit more life behind me, left me in absolute awe.\n\nQuentin Tarantino truly crafted something unreal with these films. The stylistic range, the pacing, the character arcs, the music, the cinematography\u2026 it\u2019s all so intentional, so bold, and so damn cool. It reminded me of just how thrilling movies can be when every frame feels like it was made with love and madness.\n\nI\u2019ve been craving that \u201choly sh*t, THIS is cinema\u201d feeling for a while now, and Kill Bill delivered it in spades. It\u2019s a reminder of why we fall in love with film in the first place.\n\nSo if it\u2019s been a few years\u2014or you\u2019ve only ever seen it once\u2014this is your sign to queue it up. You won\u2019t regret it.",

I just gave it a quick search and saw that it was George Clooney, Harvey Kitel, Selma Hyek and that Tarantino had something to do with it. Sounded like the makings of a good flick.\n\nI generally hate spoilers, so I usually don't read much about movies outside of the basic premise before I watch them. The last movie that blindsided me this bad was when I watched Bone Tomahawk. \n\nAnyone else get blindsided by this movie? What other movies totally caught you off guard?",

A well paced, good script, well acted movie about less known stories who arent as flashy and glamour.\n\nThere are so many aspect of baseball which i didnt get ofcourse but I dont even think this movie needs a person to know so much about baseball.\n\nPoint is this movie subverts almost every sports movie clich\u00e9. I am a big football fan and I follows different clubs, league games, manegerial stuff, transfers nd all And i can resonate every thing about movie. There\u2019s no big championship scene, no locker room speech, no slow-mo victory montage. Instead, it\u2019s about spreadsheets, stats, undervalued players and background story of how much pressure they go through.\n\nBrad pitt was just excellent and he should have won oscar for this one rather than OUATIH. Its simply one of the best nuanced performance i have ever seen. Brings so much depth to the character without going offbeat for once yet hit every stress conflict scenes perfectly. Probably my fav performance of him\n\nEmotional as well last scene, that daughter tape made me smile and sad at same time.\n\nIf there is any person who havent seen this movie, give it a chance its something very rare and fresh air. 10/10 already one of my all time fav movies list.",
