        "title": "January 2-4 Box Office Recap \u2013 'Avatar: Fire and Ash' crosses $1B worldwide; James Cameron becomes first director with four films to reach that milestone. 'Zootopia 2' nears $1.6B worldwide. The series finale of 'Stranger Things' sold $25M-$30M in concession cash to movie theaters.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/9ndiblif7mbg1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdac8b4984b3d4d52c969b2622d97647e2f4a804\n\n2026 got to a pretty good start, even though there was a lack of notable newcomers this week. Unsurprisingly, ***Avatar: Fire and Ash*** held the top spot for the third week. In the process, it broke past the $1 billion mark worldwide. And ***Zootopia 2*** had another insane performance overseas, raising the bar for where it will finish.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $124.4 million this weekend. That's up 26% from last year, when ***Mufasa: The Lion King*** reached #1 on its third weekend.\n\nStaying on top for the third weekend, ***Avatar: Fire and Ash*** earned $41.4 million. That represents a light 34% drop. Although ***The Way of Water*** actually increased on its third weekend and it was also much higher ($67 million), given that it only started to benefit from the holidays.\n\n***Fire and Ash*** has amassed $307.6 million to date. Last week, it was $44.1 million behind ***The Way of Water***, and now that has grown to $117.8 million. And it will only continue growing over the next days. It could still hit $500 million domestically, but it's not guaranteed.\n\n***Zootopia 2*** has enjoyed some great legs thanks to the holidays. It eased just 2%, for a great $19.3 million weekend. With $364 million domestically, it has officially passed the original's gross ($341.2 million). Given the lack of competition on January, it should definitely reach $400 million domestically.\n\nIn third place, Lionsgate's ***The Housemaid*** is breaking past any expectations. It dipped a very slight 1%, earning $15.1 million this weekend. The film has amassed $75.9 million domestically, and it should finish its run with over $120 million domestically. The biggest Lionsgate title since ***The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes***.\n\nIn fourth place, A24's ***Marty Supreme*** is showing word of mouth is on its favor. The film dipped just 29%, earning $12.5 million this weekend. Through 11 days in wide release, the film has earned a fantastic $56 million. It's already A24's third biggest ever film, and it will pass ***Civil War*** ($68 million) by next week. Given its great word of mouth and heavy Oscar buzz, ***Marty Supreme*** could get as high as $90 million domestically.\n\nSony's ***Anaconda*** eased just 31%, adding $10 million. After 11 days, the film has earned $45.8 million, and should make its way to almost $80 million by the end of its run.\n\n***The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants*** eased 25%, for a $8.3 million. The film's domestic total stands at $57.7 million, and it should continue holding well thanks to no animated competition in January.\n\nAngel Studios' ***David*** eased 39%, earning $7.6 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $69.7 million, although perhaps it seems $100 million will be a bit of a challenge.\n\n***Song Sung Blue*** eased just 17% on its second weekend, earning $5.8 million. The film's 11-day total stands at $25 million, and it could still reach $40 million if it keeps holding well.\n\n***Wicked: For Good*** dipped 39%, for a $3.2 million weekend. The film has amassed $339.8 million so far.\n\nRounding out the Top 10 was ***Five Nights at Freddy's 2*** with $2.6 million, just a 39% drop. The film has earned $125.2 million, and it looks like it will fall off now that holidays are over.\n\nThere was one single wide release this week, Vertical's ***We Bury the Dead***. But it finished outside the Top 10, earning $2.5 million in 1,172 theaters. That's Vertical's best ever debut, although it just speaks volumes on how low they are as a distributor.\n\nIt seems like Park Chan-wook's ***No Other Choice*** is picking up some steam. Even though it's playing in just 45 theaters, the film hit the 12th spot with $1 million this weekend. That's a dazzling $22,247 per-theater average, signaling great word of mouth. It will continue expanding, and could possibly hit the Top 10 next week.\n\nOn December 31st through January 1, 620 theaters screened the series finale of ***Stranger Things***. There are no official figures, although the trades report that it sold an estimated $25 million-$30 million in consessions. As Netflix does not report figures, this was all reported as concession vouchers. They allowed theaters to keep 95% of the sales, a fantastic figure.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\nJames Cameron did it again.\n\n***Avatar: Fire and Ash*** has crossed the $1 billion milestone, thanks to a $169.6 million overseas haul this week. With this, he has become the first director to have four titles reach $1 billion worldwide, after ***Titanic*** and the prior ***Avatar*** films. There's not a market breakdown for now, but its biggest market has been China with $138 million. Given the empty January, it should continue legging out just fine.\n\nBut even with ***Avatar*** taking the spotlight, ***Zootopia 2*** continues destroying records. This weekend was actually better than last week, as it added $81.7 million overseas. That takes its worldwide gross to an insane $1.590 billion. It already passed ***Frozen II*** ($1.453 billion) to become Walt Disney Animation Studios' biggest ever film. \n\nIn China, ***Zootopia 2*** actually increased to $38 million over a five-day holiday. It already surpassed ***Avengers: Endgame*** in ticket sales, but this weekend, it eclipsed that film's \u00a5$4.249 billion total to become the biggest ever Hollywood title in the market. That's roughly \u00a54.250 billion ($604.1 million), which means it has both the adjusted and unadjusted record.\n\nNot content with taking down ***Frozen II***, ***Zootopia 2*** is now aiming for another record: the biggest ever Hollywood animated film, ***Inside Out 2*** ($1.698 billion). It's just $108 million away, which means it could get there as early as next week. After that, ***Zootopia 2*** will try to reach $1.8 billion, and could get as high as $1.9 billion. Which means that there's a possibility that it outgrosses ***Avatar: Fire and Ash*** to become the biggest Hollywood title of 2025.\n\n***Anaconda*** added $13.4 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $88.3 million. The best markets are Australia ($5.8M), the UK ($5.3), and Mexico ($4M). In the next few days, it will cross the $100 million mark.\n\nWhile there's no complete overseas breakdown, ***The Housemaid*** is proving to be a success outside America. It has crossed $130 million worldwide, and with the legs it's showing, it should easily get to $200 million.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Now You See Me: Now You Don't* | Nov/14 | Lionsgate | $21,013,793 | $61,882,396 | $211,216,528 | $90M\n\n- A vanishing act. Lionsgate's ***Now You See Me: Now You Don't*** has closed with $211 million worldwide. It clearly shows there's still interest in the franchise, although it also shows it already hit a ceiling. It didn't quite change the fact that it's the lowest grossing film in the franchise, as this is a 37% drop from the second film. Lionsgate is clearly confident in this franchise, and they already have a fourth film in development. But given how the film performed, it's likely that it will continue the franchise's decline at the box office.\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nAlright, we finally getting some notable wide releases.\n\nAs it's now a tradition, Gerard Butler has another January film. That's ***Greenland 2: Migration***, sequel to the 2020 film. Even though it only made $52 million worldwide (pandemic you know?), the film was a huge success in PVOD, which is what motivated Lionsgate to pick up the rights to the sequel. Although the film's $90 million budget is a huge concern.\n\nParamount is also releasing ***Primate***, the first major horror title of the year, following a family's chimpanzee who goes bananas and starts killing people. The film has premiered at Fantastic Fest and earned some great reviews so far (92% on RT). Will this surprise?\n\nIn limited release, Row K Entertainment will start its run as distributor with Gus Van Sant's ***Dead Man's Wire***. It stars Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd as Tony Kiritsis, who was involved in the 1977 Indianapolis hostage standoff. The film debuted in Venice with a fantastic response (98% on RT), although usually a film of this caliber is released in fall to contend for fall season. Nevertheless, it should score a great per-theater average ahead of its wide expansion next week.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice.",

        "content": "Just the title. I love soundtracks and as I was going through my collection I saw the soundtrack for The Guru. I really don't remember if the soundtrack was good, but I'm guessing I enjoyed it since I bought it, but Idr that it was a pretty unanimous feeling among my whole friend group that the movie sucked. I remember one friend walked out and waited for us rather than sitting through it. Part of me wants to watch it again just to see if I still think it's bad. ",

        "content": "I just finished watching this masterpiece. Let's start by saying that I'm a Talking Heads fan, so I knew many of the songs and even something about their stage mannerisms. And yet, it left me speechless.\n\nI don't think I've ever had so much fun and felt so involved watching a film. Byrne and the rest of the band not only manage to bring all their songs to life perfectly, but they do something even more difficult: they make them believable. The cinematography is simple, precise, and tries to make room for all the characters, while the audience is revealed only in the final moments. The set design changes as the songs progress, and the frontman's movements reflect the mood of the song. The song list is also wonderful, each one better than the last.\n\nSo, what do you think of Stop Making Sense?",

I'm familiar with a few other more popular ones, like *Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance* and *I Saw the Devil*, but I might need a few days and a bottle of whiskey to recover from *The Chaser* before watching either of those.\n\nYou know that scene in *Sinister* when Ethan Hawk is drinking whiskey and watching the murder tapes? That's basically how I feel binge watching Korean neo-noir. Absolutely ruthless films and unlike in recent Western movies where you expect the movie to end on a happy note, you really have no idea what you're going to get with these. They don't even care to give you closure half the time. And you know what? I dig it. I do.\n\nWould love some suggestions in the meantime.",

The whole movie was just unlike anything that had ever come out before. It has a few small editing issues, but damn man, it is just one of those movies that had to be seen in the theater to fully appreciate how good it was. That was peak Russell Crowe and peak Ridley Scott.",

        "content": "I recently rewatched First Blood, and while I genuinely enjoy all the sequels, I usually recommend the first film as a standalone tragic character study. In my head, the rest of the franchise exists in a \u201cwhat if\u201d universe and can live there just fine.\n\nThe original ending\u2019s ambiguity feels essential to the character\u2019s arc. Once later films provide clearer resolutions, more backstory and direction, the emotional weight of that first story shifts in a way that makes it feel less complete on its own.\n\nAre there other films you feel were better served by ambiguity rather than explanation or continuation? And I\u2019m not anti-sequel...another example for me is Stranger Than Fiction. Had that ending remained more open (and maybe tragic) I think we\u2019d still be debating it as something truly special.",

        "title": "Frailty interpretations",
        "content": "Just rewatched Frailty, and what I\u2019ve always loved about this film is that they leave enough ambiguity to have several valid competing interpretations. \n\nI found one review that I think sums this and its relation to Adam as an unreliable narrator pretty well: https://manorvellum.medium.com/truth-defies-reason-perception-reality-and-frailty-dca03c20d04a. \n\n\u201cAt the title credit in the writer commentary, Brent Hanley says \"Frailty to me was always about the frailty of perception, the frailty of morality, the frailty of right and wrong.\" At around 2 mins he adds, \"I liked the idea of an abstract title.\"\u201d (IMDb trivia)\n\nIt seems most people completely buy into everything Adam tells them and accept that Fenton was a demon and the \u201cGod\u2019s hand killer,\u201d that he kept his victims in his basement, and that all of Adam and dad\u2019s visions were legit, all the victims were indeed demons. While I think this is a valid read, it surprises me a little that it seems to be so universally accepted. \n\nI think the film actually presents three equally valid interpretations that compete with each other, and that\u2019s what makes it so fun and effective. The film is a bit of a litmus test that lends itself to varied interpretations based on viewers\u2019 own world views and biases. I think this is the brilliance of the film. Here are the 3 possible realities, as I see it:\n\n1. Adam and his dad are legit demon hunters; Fenton is a demon and serial killer. I think this is both the least scary and actually least probable take. I\u2019ll explain why further down. \n\n2. Fenton is not a demon, and Adam and dad are crazy. No one is a demon, but both Adam and Fenton were so warped from the immense abuse and trauma of their childhood that they both become serial killers. Adam kills people he thinks are demons, and Fenton becomes \u201cGod\u2019s hand killer,\u201d and keeps bodies in his basement. \n\n3. Fenton is neither a demon nor a serial killer. He never killed and kept corpses in his basement. That\u2019s all just part of Adam\u2019s delusion, and Adam has killed those people and framed Fenton because Adam is suffering such severe delusion that Fenton is a demon that Adam must make it real and commits all of the crimes but convinces himself Fenton killed the ones Adam framed Fenton for as well as all the ones he takes credit for as \u201cdestroying demons.\u201d  -To me, this is the scariest and most compelling take. \n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that Adam is established as an \\*unreliable narrator\\*, and we cannot take anything we see through his eyes as factual. We only see the \u201cdemons\u201d sins \\*through Adam\u2019s eyes\\* in \\*his visions\\*, which are at least as likely to be delusions as they are to be real. We know that Adam frames Fenton for Agent Doyle\u2019s murder by placing the list with his name crossed off at the scene so everyone will think Doyle is \u201cFenton\u2019s last victim.\u201d We have no real legitimate reason to think Adam could not also have framed Fenton for the rest of the murders in the basement as well. It\u2019s plausible he may have no conscious memory of committing those crimes because his fractured psyche needs to believe his dad was a good man under God\u2019s guidance and must believe Fenton is a demon to protect his delusions. His delusions are so strong, he creates the crimes he needs to believe Fenton guilty of and the evidence for them so he can have peace in believing he \u201cdestroyed the demon\u201d Fenton rather than murdered his brother who was the only person trying to protect him from their abuse. It\u2019s not that Fenton is guilty or a demon: that\u2019s all part of Adam\u2019s delusions. When we see Fenton ask to be buried in the rose garden, we are seeing it \\*through Adam\u2019s eyes\\*, and like everything else Adam tells us, we can\u2019t trust it because he is an unreliable narrator suffering from violent psychotic delusions. He believes everything he says, but we should not. \n\nIn this version of reality, the tired rookie agent just wasn\u2019t paying that much attention to the features of a potential witness he spoke to briefly; Adam was wearing a baseball hat, and the agent just didn\u2019t get a good look. The tapes glitched because tapes glitch sometimes. Fenton was simply a poor tortured soul traumatized by his experiences as a child and then murdered by the brother he tried so hard to save. Adam is suffering murderous delusions and will go on killing innocent people with impunity and likely raise his unborn child to believe it all and carry on his work. This is the scariest and most heartbreaking interpretation, and for that reason is my favorite. I do feel it\u2019s very intentional that we get all three possible realities and support for each of them. There is an inherent \u201cfrailty of perception\u201d not just of the characters and their viewpoints but in our own perceptions, and this is reinforced by the beautiful use of Adam\u2019s unreliable narration as our main view. \n\nWhat\u2019s really interesting in terms of trivia for the film is that it\u2019s loosely based on a serial killer who claimed god gave him visions (per IMDB trivia tidbits). \u201cLoosely based on the case of American serial killer Joseph Kallinger who murdered three people and tortured four families. He committed these crimes with his 13-year-old son Michael between 1974-1975 in New Jersey. Kallinger pleaded insanity, claiming God had told him to kill.\u201d I think knowing this connection further supports the idea all the supernatural parts are all fruit of Dad and Adam\u2019s delusion tree. \n\nI enjoy this film as much today as when it came out. It really holds up and is so layered and such a great use of unreliable narrator. It\u2019s so intriguing to me that most people seem willing to buy into everything our unreliable narrator says even though he is very clearly revealed to be unreliable. Why is everyone so ready to accept Adam\u2019s perspective as fact when all the evidence to the opposite is equally there? I think that\u2019s what makes it fun. ",
