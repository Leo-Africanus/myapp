The leader of the turtles is a human sized rat who has come into contact with the same green ooze.

        "content": "Every once in a while I\u2019ll remember a movie that got announced years ago, made a bunch of noise... and then just disappeared. Like it was gonna be a thing, people were attached, maybe even a script got written, and then nothing. Either it\u2019s technically still \u201cin development\u201d or it quietly died and no one said anything.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s easily the 21 Jump Street / Men in Black crossover. That\u2019s such a stupid idea but also exactly the kind of stupid I love. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill somehow getting wrapped up in alien stuff? That could\u2019ve been gold. And there was real talk of it happening. Like script written, people attached, it almost existed. What the hell happened??\n\nThere\u2019s a bunch of others that pop into my head from time to time, stuff like Guillermo del Toro\u2019s Lovecraft movie, Fincher doing a Jules Verne thing, or all those weird Star Wars spinoffs that probably died the second someone changed jobs at Disney. And then there\u2019s stuff like Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian, which sounds insane but apparently almost existed?\n\nAnd there\u2019s so many others. Whole graveyard of weird, wild, or straight-up insane projects that almost happened. Most of them probably wouldn\u2019t have even worked, but I still wish we got to see the mess.\n\nWhat\u2019s the one for you? The movie that got scrapped, delayed to death, or is still fake-alive in \u201cdevelopment\u201d that you\u2019d instantly buy a ticket for if it suddenly came back?\n\n",

A simple story that all takes in a matter of hours and just has a certain energy to the pacing that makes it one of the shortest 2 hours films I've ever watched.\n\nWhen they say no one knows how to shoot LA like Michael Mann, they really aren't kidding imo. So many amazing shots of the city's landscape throughout this film.\n\nMichael Mann's directing style is just absolutely brilliant and one of the most unique out there that gives this film a unique identity as well.\n\nTom Cruise as this move's villain is maybe my favorite role he's ever done as well. It's nice to see an actor who's constantly playing the hero play the villain for once and boy, does Cruise do that well here.\n\nOf course, there are times where some realism and laws of physics are probably sacrificed for a more compelling plot, but I thought that was fine in term of the overall narrative.\n\nThis is definitely one movie I highly recommend seeing if you haven't yet. 10/10 in my book.",

Funny enough, my favorite Wayne movie is The Quite Man. Rooster and True Grit are up there too. McLintock(Drago is a personal favorite) is just a guilty pleasure at this point, along with El Dorado(mostly for Mississippi) and Rio Bravo(mostly for Stumpy and Colorado). I sometimes find that I enjoy the co-leads more than the character JW is playing. \n\nI say all that to ask this, who is you favorite co-lead in a John Wayne film? ",

        "content": "For me its Maverick (the 1994 western, altho the top gun sequel is pretty great too) and Oscar (1991). They are both so beautyfull and fun, the sets and costumes are top of the line, the actors were perfectly cast, both are infinitely rewatchable. It would be really hard for me to think of similar comedies from recent years, to be fair i dont watch too many comedies in general but it doesnt help that any time one find itself in front of me its either crass or loud or lewd or just cringe and awkward in general. \n\nI can only recommend them to everyone.\n\nIts not exactly old but i just wanna mention Mad Max Fury Road. Its perfect how every little detail comes together like gears in a clock, each time i watch it i notice new details wich just makes me apreciate it more. The behind the scenes just make it all more impressive, they actually did everything they could practically, no corners cut, and it really does make a diference, it actually feels like looking into a whole diferent world.

A group of brilliant students work on a laser project, only to discover it's secretly being used for military purposes. Made 13 million US only. This one is my favorite. \n3. **My Science Project**\u00a0: Released\u00a0**August 9, 1985** was a Disney release and is less known...

Misdirection was the name of the game, and the only thing you could expect was the unexpected. I don\u2019t know what I was supposed to walk out of that theater with, and honestly I am not sure how to even describe the experience to friends.
