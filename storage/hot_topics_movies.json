Particularly impressive is the final swordfight between Barbossa and Jack where they interchange between the Cursed forms and their human forms in very quick succession with almost ZERO hint of editing etc. of the scene itself to disguise the CGI changes. Just truly incredible stuff.",

        "title": "The Matrix Reloaded has some of the best fight choreography I've ever seen.",
        "content": "I love how much attention to detail was put into the fights in this movie.  Too many \"1 vs. numerous assailants\" fights fall into the trap of having the opponents wait their turn to fight the hero.  Here, while Neo is maneuvering to only have to fight one or two people at a time, the others are continually seeking to reengage him.  During the Smiths fight, you can see all the other Smiths reacting in real time to Neo's every move.  \n\nAnother challenge in movie fights is straddling the line between realism and aesthetic appeal.  While I wouldn't call any of the fights realistic, they are believable within the rules of the Matrix where they take place.  There are few moments when an action does not produce an expected reaction, which I think is the key to not taking the viewer out of immersion when watching a fight.  \n\nFinally, there is a fluidity and rhythm to the fighting that makes them transcend action into art (particularly the chateau scene).  The movements are synced perfectly with the music, and the progression of the action tells a complete story over the course of the fight.  The detailed planning and precise execution of everyone involved in these scenes shines though and has kept me coming back to rewatch them.",

First of all one would expect that an order from the UK would be a European compatible product not an American compatible product.... Second of all what is the point of region locking DVD's, it results in situations like this where people end up buying a product they can't even use which is no fault of their own.\n\nRant over, what a waste of money!

But I rewatched Ruby Sparks again years ago, and he has like 3 min screentime in that, and yet it made such an impact on me, he has so much charisma. I watched a few of his direct to dvd type action films. Security which was a ton of fun, he\u2019s such a capable action lead. And Acts Of Vengeance which was more middling. \n\nI hate seeing him constantly get wasted in stuff like Uncharted &amp; Indiana Jones and I\u2019m not sure why he is always doing direct to dvd stuff now, not to shame it, it\u2019s a market that has its purpose, but how in the world people don\u2019t see Pain &amp; Glory or Official Competition and not want to go out of their way to work with him. He\u2019s got such a range. He was genuinely heartbreaking in Babygirl too, another characters that\u2019s a side character but his performance makes him feel more present in the film. \n\nI am yet to see a lot of his earlier work, drop some Antonio recommendations in the comments and your thoughts on him.

To quickly be able to see upcoming digital release dates for Movies (and other media) without having to filter through all the low budget and low quality noise.\n\nWhat makes my website unique is a proprietary points system to curate the listings.\n\nI won't bore you with the details but everything gets ranked based on the meta data so I can predict and decide if it's worth displaying on the website or not. I've tried to make it as inclusive and none biased as possible and believe I've succeeded in a good balance, but I will continue to work on the logic to make it even better.\n\nAnother thing is the grid layout, this will quickly tell you exactly when content is available or if the date haven't been released yet.\n\nI'm a solo dev and I'm active on it every day (just finished building the drop down filter menu).\n\nThere isn't a dedicated mobile version yet so strictly a desktop experience but it's in the books for the future.\n\ncheck it out on: https://midloop.net/",

        "title": "Ford vs Ferrari reshaped my perspective on watching films",
        "content": "As a diecast car collector, my love for cars recently took a new turn, straight into car movies. While exploring, I stumbled upon Ford v Ferrari. The title alone sets the tone, and what follows is more than just a race it\u2019s a cinematic masterpiece for car enthusiasts.\n\nThis film can easily become a favorite if you\u2019re into machines, motorsport, or the soul behind the wheel. It doesn\u2019t just entertain ! it teaches. It shows what racing means, to the driver, to the family, to the company, and to history.\n\nThe movie begins with Carroll Shelby walking into the darkness\u2026 and ends with Ken Miles dying in broad daylight. That contrast felt poetic and symbolic. The foreshadowing in this movie is brilliant, Shelby asking if he was ever on fire during a pit stop, and later, silently witnessing Ken in flames. That moment shattered me.\n\nKen\u2019s son Peter\u2019s joy begins when Ken throws a wrench at Shelby a turning point that leads to triumph. Fittingly, the film ends with Shelby passing that same wrench to Peter. A quiet but meaningful gesture.\n\nTechnically, the film reminds us that any car can be the fastest when the engineers start thinking like drivers. That blend of emotion and engineering is what makes the story roar.\n\nOne final thought ! there's a Tamil proverb: \"\u0b95\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf \u0b8e\u0b9f\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bb5\u0ba9\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0b95\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0bbe\u0bb5\u0bc1\"\n\u201cThe one who picks up the sword will die by it.\u201d\nKen Miles lived and died in a car. His victories were great, but his race, his spirit, is what will be remembered forever.\n\nHave you watched the Movie ???, pls try if you didn't. Am I missed any details ?.",
