        "content": "So I've been bingeing the live action Disney films and I watched the original Lion King when I was a kid. Which I loved\n\nSo watching the remake. The music was surprisingly great and that was the actual highlight for me. I did like Beyonce as Nala. Just my opinion though.\n\nThe visuals were beautiful to look at but I couldn't help but feel it was just a lesser version overall. From actors to pacing and the whole vibe.\n\nLittle Mermaid was...just not good. Again musically it was great but otherwise it just felt like a hacky remake. The visuals were not enjoyable nor the characterisations. Halle did the best she could with what was given.\n\nMulan. Well that's been beaten to death but I actually enjoyed it for what it is. I can't explain beyond that.I like how it took itself seriously and for some reason I couldn't compare it to the original as much. \n\nBeauty and the beast was just strange for me. I genuinely didn't enjoy it. Also I watched Sideways music analysis on the movie which helped bring out the flaws more.\n\nAladdin. I actually enjoyed it and the outfits were incredible. Jafar was not it though. Easily the weakest link.\n\nI do like how Will Smith made it his own but no one can replace Robin Williams. Out of all the remakes. This is the one I enjoyed the most, flaws and all. \n\nI do wish some of Guy Ritchie's personality came through more just because his British humour gets me but alas. Actually the Nordic prince was definitely his humour coming out.\n\nAnd that's how far I've gotten. Again these are my opinions.\n\nEdit: I haven't seen all of the remakes but to complete this post.\n\nI really enjoyed Cruella when I saw it awhile ago. Emma Stone is great at the accent and I really felt immersed in that world. Some dodgy CGI but overall a truly good film.\n\nI didn't enjoy Alice in Wonderland. Weird CGI and it felt...sickly? I felt actively turned off from it.\n\nI haven't seen Maleficent. Maybe soon.",

        "title": "When it comes to Dwayne Johnson\u2019s filmography, his films that feature wildly sweaty performances (Fast Five, The Rundown, Pain &amp; Gain) have higher critic and user averages than his less sweaty performances. This isn\u2019t great for Red One, but it\u2019s promising for The Smashing Machine",
        "content": "This is insane. It really is; however, after watching the\u00a0[*Red One*\u00a0trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l3hfD74X-4)\u00a0and seeing the first image from\u00a0[*The Smashing Machine*](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1cx7e6g/first_image_of_dwayne_johnson_in_benny_safdies/)*,*\u00a0I became convinced that there was a correlation between the sweatiness of a Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson performance and its impact (good or bad) on his career. Between T*he Rundown, Fast Five, Pain &amp; Gain*, and\u00a0*The Game Plan*, his career heats up when his body is trying to cool down. This is why I\u2019m optimistic about\u00a0*The Smashing Machine*, as it seems like Johnson is going back to basics to escape his recent VFX-heavy run.\u00a0*The Smashing Machine*\u00a0will be a sweaty reset \u2013 which is what Johnson has relied on for 20+ years of success.\u00a0\n\nJohnson has made a career out of talking/posting/writing about his sweat. The tagline for his Under Armour collaboration is \u201c[BLOOD, SWEAT, RESPECT](https://about.underarmour.com/en/stories/2018/11/blood--sweat--respect.html),\u201d and when\u00a0[talking about his career,](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/young-rock-inside-dwayne-johnsons-turbulent-delinquent-pre-fame/)\u00a0he said, \u201cYou gotta get up in the morning, you gotta get after it, you gotta put in the work, you gotta sweat. There\u2019s gonna be heavy iron, and there\u2019s gonna be a lot of sweat, and it\u2019s gonna be dirty.\u201d His Instagram posts almost always make sure to include the word \u201c[Sweat](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-Qr-GNyoYk/?img_index=therock).\u201d. He\u2019s basically worked sweat into his persona ([Sweat Equity\u00a0](https://www.instagram.com/therock/p/CQpiWpdFyRq/?hl=en)is his thing), so this data isn\u2019t as random or dumb as you\u2019d think.\n\nThe sweat levels should only go to 10, but after watching his movies again, I had to create an \u201c11\u201d category because there are a handful of movies in which Johnson\u2019s sweat glands work overtime. To place each film in their respective categories, I rewatched his movies, looked for sweaty scenes/moments (Yes \u2013 it\u2019s wild, but I had to follow the idea), and came up with a chart. It wasn\u2019t too hard because, since 2017, I\u2019ve been assigned a\u00a0[handful of Dwayne Johnson data posts\u00a0](https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/dwayne-johnsons-12-trillion-movie-damage-bill/)and research assignments, so they\u2019ve familiarized me with his filmography. Also, if you're want to learn more about the data collection I recorded a podcast episode about it (Movies, Films and Flix pod - you can find it anywhere).\n\n* **Category 11 \u2013 Red**\u00a0\u2013 The distribution makes me happy\n* **Category 9 \u2013 10 \u2013 Purple**\u00a0\u2013 on average, it\u2019s the most lucrative category\n* **Category 5 \u2013 8 \u2013 Green**\u00a0\u2013 Hasn\u2019t made a category 5-8 movie since 2017\u2019s\u00a0**The Fate of the Furious**.\u00a0\n* **Category 0 \u2013 4 \u2013 Orange**\u00a0\u2013 6 of his last 10 movies fall in this category.\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pshv2wn5sv0e1.png?width=1352&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11b210c750904264b8e3d997d8f364e0ac701180\n\nSix films fall into the 11 category:\u00a0*The Rundown, The Game Plan, Fast Five, Pain &amp; Gain, Skyscraper*, and\u00a0*The Smashing Machine*\u00a0(it\u2019s hypothetical). In their own way, these movies have proven important in The Rock\u2019s\u00a0 evolution as an actor and act as cornerstones of his filmography that have influenced his career.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick breakdown. I included longer explanations of their importance below, but these work as nice cliff notes if you are in a hurry or hate reading.\u00a0\n\n* **The Rundown (2003)**\u00a0\u2013 In an interview with\u00a0[The Boston Globe](https://www.goupstate.com/story/news/2004/04/02/the-rock-by-any-other-name-would-still-walk-tall/29712571007/), Johnson said that when\u00a0*The Rundown*\u00a0was met with praise from critics, action fans, and general audiences, he went from \u201cThe Rock\u201d to Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson \u2013 which to him meant that people were starting to take him seriously.\u00a0\n* **The Game Plan (2007)**\u00a0\u2013 After\u00a0*Walking Tall, Doom, Gridiron Gang,*\u00a0and\u00a0*Be Cool,*\u00a0Johnson needed a hit, which came in the form of the PG-Rated Disney film\u00a0*The Game Plan*. Not only did it help him build a new fanbase, but it was his first non-action film to make more than $100 million worldwide.\u00a0\n* **Fast Five (2011)**\u2013 Once again, after\u00a0*Southland Tales, Race to Witch Mountain, Tooth Fairy,*\u00a0and\u00a0*Faster*, Johnson found new management and reset his career path. He shaved his head, gained 30 pounds, and got mean again for\u00a0*Fast Five.*\u00a0This propelled him into the action stratosphere.\n* **Pain &amp; Gain (2013)**\u00a0\u2013 Not only does it feature his best performance, but it\u2019s also his best R-rated film, and he will probably never play a character like this again. In 2013, both\u00a0*Pain &amp; Gain*\u00a0and\u00a0*Snitch*\u00a0failed to clear $100 million at the worldwide box office \u2013 that hasn\u2019t happened since.\u00a0\n* **Skyscraper (2018)**\u00a0\u2013 The movie underwhelmed at the box office and kicked off a new era of \u201cimmortal Superman\u201d Johnson. It\u2019s wild watching this film now and seeing a Dwayne Johnson character crying while cradling his daughter atop a burning skyscraper (don\u2019t worry, Neve Campbell saves the day).\u00a0\n\n**Here are longer explanations of why these films are important (if you read the above section, you can skip to the numbers below)**\n\n**1. The Rundown (2003)**\u00a0\u2013 Johnson\u2019s first starring role in\u00a0*The Scorpion King*\u00a0was a success, and it did well theatrically. Still, Johnson wanted other roles to prove he could carry a dialogue-heavy action film that wasn\u2019t part of an existing franchise. Johnson took\u00a0*The Rundown*\u00a0role to step up his acting game and credits director Peter Berg as his \u201cpersonal acting coach on set every day.\u201d After watching the film,\u00a0[Ebert gave it 3.5 stars](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-rundown)\u00a0and dropped this doozy of a compliment\n\n* [Ebert\u00a0](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-rundown)\u2013 \u201cEarly in \u201cThe Rundown,\u201d The Rock enters a nightclub to confront some tough guys, and he passes Arnold Schwarzenegger on the way out. \u2018Have a good time,\u2019 Arnold says. It\u2019s like he\u2019s passing the torch. Whether The Rock will rival Schwarzenegger\u2019s long run as an action hero is hard to say \u2014 but on the basis of \u201cThe Rundown,\u201d he has a good chance.\u201d\n\n* I like this David Shoemaker paragraph from his\u00a0[Grantland](https://grantland.com/features/a-look-career-dwayne-rock-johnson-eve-wrestlemania-29-new-film-pain-gain/)\u00a0days \u2013 \u201cFor the first time, Johnson feels like a legitimate star, but that\u2019s mostly thanks to director Peter Berg, who understood that Johnson\u2019s true talent was his humor. Rather than portray Johnson as a muscly automaton in some hard-boiled revenge tale, Berg made a grimy comedy and allowed Johnson to have fun. Even the fight scenes (of which there are many) are played for chuckles.\u201d\n\nJohnson went all out ([he lost 20 pounds for the role to be more lean](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/features/9-rock-s-greatest-movie-roles-and-unique-body-he-brought-each-one/)), and the positive reviews proved that he could headline a reasonably successful action film. It was a big step in his acting career, and in an interview with\u00a0[The Boston Globe](https://www.goupstate.com/story/news/2004/04/02/the-rock-by-any-other-name-would-still-walk-tall/29712571007/), Johnson said that after acting in\u00a0*The Rundown*, he went from \u201cThe Rock\u201d to Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson \u2013 which to him meant that people were starting to take him seriously.\n\n**Importance of the Sweaty Role**\u2014He carried a critically appreciated action film and proved he could act alongside people like Christopher Walken. It was his first critically adored film and his only Fresh (60% or higher Tomatometer score) film for eight years (2003 \u2013 2011). It\u2019s still his highest-rated \u201cDwayne Johnson\u201d film (*Hobbs and Shaw,*\u00a0he\u2019s a co-lead, and he\u2019s part of an ensemble in\u00a0*Fast Five*\u00a0and the\u00a0*Jumanji*\u00a0films).\u00a0\n\n**Best Moment(s)**\u00a0\u2013 His character does wipe out an entire army, but it\u2019s nice when he looks fallible. There are some good scenes\u00a0[when he has his butt kicked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJXF9gcUcNU&amp;list=PLZbXA4lyCtqrLErljYah2rRpWvQANP9Ut&amp;index=7&amp;pp=iAQB),\u00a0[gets harassed by baboons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdYPqVZIB9M&amp;list=PLZbXA4lyCtqrLErljYah2rRpWvQANP9Ut&amp;index=6&amp;pp=iAQB), and\u00a0[rolls down hills](https://youtu.be/jKyhNbLEKxY?list=PLZbXA4lyCtqrLErljYah2rRpWvQANP9Ut).\u00a0\n\n**2. The Game Plan (2007)**\u00a0\u2013\u00a0*The Game Plan*\u00a0was Johnson\u2019s first $100 million grossing film since\u00a0*The Scorpion King*\u00a0(2002), proving he could headline family-friendly comedies. Johnson said he wanted to make a\u00a0[movie that his daughter could watch,](https://www.blackfilm.com/20070921/features/dwaynejohnson.shtml)\u00a0but it was mainly a smart pivot after\u00a0*Doom, Be Cool*, and\u00a0*Walking Tall*\u00a0didn\u2019t take off. It definitely boosted his box office marketability, and he went on to appear in\u00a0*Get Smart, Tooth Fairy, Race to Witch Mountain*, and\u00a0*The Other Guys*\u00a0(which all grossed over $100 million).\u00a0\n\n**Importance of Sweaty Role**\u00a0\u2013 Johnson picked up a new fan base, and the role helped re-spark his career for a short time.\u00a0\n\n**Best Moments**\u00a0\u2013 He\u00a0[cries](https://youtu.be/ZD8wDJKzEgY),\u00a0[dances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFwBMwCOF-Q&amp;pp=ygUYdGhlIGdhbWUgcGxhbiAyMDA3IGRhbmNl),\u00a0[sings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQuA6Iobmqw&amp;pp=ygUYdGhlIGdhbWUgcGxhbiAyMDA3IGRhbmNl),\u00a0[sweats](https://youtu.be/XGQRDirweUM),\u00a0[reads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI17vaYpW1A&amp;list=PLBtsbn2MpaQ83fKOnSR0dt4Wqwe7-QOR7&amp;index=9&amp;pp=iAQB), and\u00a0[sings more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfKjInbMjnw&amp;list=PLBtsbn2MpaQ83fKOnSR0dt4Wqwe7-QOR7&amp;index=20&amp;pp=iAQB). You can legitimately feel the desperation and willingness to do anything to make the movie work.\n\n**3. Fast Five (2011) \u2013**\u00a0*Fast Five*\u00a0currently has his highest IMDb and Letterboxd scores of any Johnson film, and it legitimately propelled him into the big leagues. On the set of\u00a0*Fast Five*, he told his makeup artist to\u00a0[leave him alone and let him be sweaty](https://x.com/TheRock/status/1336855153719185408)\u2014this paid off.\u00a0\n\n[In an interview with Esquire](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/interviews/a36037/dwayne-johnson-the-rock-0815/), Johnson said he had a moment of clarity in 2010 when he realized he had to \u201cstop, readjust, reassess, and change everything around me\u2014and I gotta take one more shot.\u201d He needed to take one more shot at superstardom after years of movies like\u00a0*Faster, Race to Witch Mountain, Tooth Fairy*, and\u00a0*Planet 51*\u00a0(*Southland Tales*\u00a0didn\u2019t help either), lowered his stock, and halted any growth as an actor. So, he changed up his management, and after years of talking to Vin Diesel about joining the\u00a0*Fast and Furious*\u00a0franchise, he shaved his head, grew an insane goatee, and put on\u00a0[30 pounds of weight](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/features/9-rock-s-greatest-movie-roles-and-unique-body-he-brought-each-one/#:~:text='Fast%20Five'%20(2011),-Johnson's%20turn%20as&amp;text=of%20crime%20fighter.-,After%20years%20of%20leaner%20roles%20in%20films%20like%20Tooth%20Fairy,doughy%2Dby%2Dcomparison%20Diesel.)\u00a0(after years of being encouraged to lose weight) to play Luke Hobbs in\u00a0*Fast Five*. The film was a gigantic hit, propelling Johnson into the action stratosphere. It\u2019s worth noting that this is easily his sweatiest film \u2013 and probably his best action movie.\u00a0\n\n**Importance of the Sweaty Role**\u00a0\u2013 He got mean again and kicked some ass.\u00a0\n\n**Best Moment**\u00a0\u2013\u00a0[He loses a fight to Vin Diesel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2PsfXZ3wyY&amp;pp=ygUPZmFzdCBmaXZlIGZpZ2h0). This won\u2019t happen again.\u00a0\n\n**4. Pain &amp; Gain (2013)**\u00a0\u2013\u00a0*Pain &amp; Gain*\u00a0features Johnson\u2019s best performance (he\u2019s perfect in it), and it was nice seeing him back in R-rated territory after\u00a0*Faster, Southland Tales*, and\u00a0*Doom*\u00a0didn\u2019t click with the mainstream. Johnson accepted a massive pay cut (the main actors all did this for a cut of the backend) because he loved the complexity of the role, and it was a nice departure from his typical type of role. The film didn\u2019t make much money, but it\u2019s a beautifully sweaty (and nasty) piece of Michael Bay R-rated Bayhem. What\u2019s interesting is that since\u00a0*Pain &amp; Gain*, he\u2019s veered away from performances like this and, in 2018, said, \u201c[No one\u2019s going to see me play a borderline psychopath suffering from depression](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/dwayne-johnson-the-pain-and-the-passion-that-fuel-the-rock-630076/).\u201d This is kind of a bummer because he\u2019s given up on edgy performances that push him as an actor and instead dove into more safe comedies and action films.\u00a0\n\n**Quick Note**\u00a0\u2013\u00a0[During a 2024 GQ article](https://www.gq.com/story/dwayne-johnson-men-of-the-year-cover-2024)\u00a0he backtracked on his 2018 comments and said \u201cI don\u2019t know who the f\\*\\*k that guy is.\u201d\n\n**Importance of the Sweaty Role**\u00a0\u2013 It proved he still had an edge and could push himself in non-blockbusters. Also, as Johnson said, \u201c[The biggest departure](https://theultimaterabbit.com/2019/06/09/dwayne-johnson-on-getting-pumped-up-for-pain-gain/)\u00a0(for me) was the vulnerability, showing this type of vulnerability and playing a character who is easily influenced and who\u2019s just out of prison and looking for salvation.\u201d\n\n**Best Moments**\u00a0\u2013\u00a0[The neighborhood watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diiaCw3frzo&amp;pp=ygUSUGFpbiBhbmQgR2FpbiAyMDEz)\u00a0scene is wonderful.\u00a0[He\u2019s terrible at robbing banks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8lQy1CTlZk&amp;pp=ygUSUGFpbiBhbmQgR2FpbiAyMDEz), and\u00a0[I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019ll never see him grill a hand again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esg4w4b2xvc&amp;list=PLZbXA4lyCtqr50cPGNoGN1w-TAWqYwpMr&amp;index=10&amp;pp=iAQB).\n\nOverall, it\u2019s easily his best R-rated film.\u00a0\n\n**5. Skyscraper (2018)**\u00a0\u2013\u00a0*Skyscraper*\u00a0didn\u2019t make globs of money or achieve critical praise, BUT it features a different type of Johnson performance. SPOILER \u2013 At the end of the film, he\u2019s sitting atop a skyscraper and awaiting his death while he clings to his daughter (he\u2019s also crying, which is rare). At the last second, Neve Campbell saves the day and resets the skyscraper\u2019s fire extinguishers. The movie received a lot of pre-buzz because Johnson\u2019s character lost a leg and had to save the day with a prosthesis. It\u2019s an odd choice (I guess it takes away from his superhuman prowess), but he went on an all-out promotional campaign and seemed to genuinely care about normalizing disabilities.\u00a0\n\nInterestingly, this is probably the last time we\u2019ll see this kind of character from Johnson. He tried to play a \u201cnormal guy,\u201d and it didn\u2019t work. He followed it up with\u00a0*Hobbs and Shaw*\u00a0(Hobbs becomes a superhero in it),\u00a0*Jumanji: The Next Level*\u00a0(plays a dude named Smolder Bravestone),\u00a0*Jungle Cruise*\u00a0(no spoilers \u2013 you\u2019ll see),\u00a0*Red Notice*\u00a0(barf) and\u00a0*Black Adam*\u00a0(wildly powerful). They are miles away from his\u00a0*Skyscraper*\u00a0character and more in line with his over-the-top persona. So, even though\u00a0*Skyscraper*\u00a0wasn\u2019t a hit, his decisions were somewhat altered because of its lack of success.\u00a0\n\n**Importance of the Sweaty Role**\u00a0\u2013 His plan didn\u2019t work, and he slowed his film output. He played a major role in seven films between 2016 and 2018, and has appeared in six films in the last five years.\u00a0\n\n**Best Moment**\u00a0\u2013\u00a0[The finale of the film sees him cradling his daughter while they wait to be burnt alive (he\u2019s also crying)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M06KzvYxlsc&amp;pp=ygURc2t5c2NyYXBlciBlbmRpbmc%3D). He REALLY wanted to seem fallible.\u00a0\n\n**Why do I think The Smashing Machine will be a sweaty success?**\n\n[Here\u2019s a quote from a recent GQ article](https://www.gq.com/story/dwayne-johnson-men-of-the-year-cover-2024)\u00a0\u2013 \u201cIt was also an opportunity for me, I realized, to stretch myself in ways that I hadn\u2019t been stretched yet, and also challenge myself in ways that I hadn\u2019t been challenged.\u201d\n\nBetween\u00a0*Red Notice, Black Adam, Jungle Cruise,*\u00a0and the upcoming\u00a0*Red One,*\u00a0Johnson has taken a lot of flak for reportedly being the alleged reason for the swelling budgets and less-than-stellar critical and box office results (there are other reasons, of course\u2026). His\u00a0*Fast X*\u00a0appearance didn\u2019t light the world on fire either. So, when it was announced that he was going to star in the Benny Safdie-directed\u00a0*The Smashing Machine*, a film adaptation named after the excellent 2002 documentary about MMA fighter Mark Kerr ([watch the doc \u2013 it\u2019s awesome](https://youtu.be/-7DO5c7gWNw)) \u2013 I knew it was Johnson pulling a hard reset on his VFX heavy blockbuster run. When I saw the sweaty first image, it became obvious that Johnson was up to his old tricks he\u2019s used throughout his career (hard resets and sweaty pivots). What\u2019s funny is that Safdie and Johnson had talked about making the film since 2019, when Johnson bought the rights to Kerr\u2019s story. Johnson admittedly\u00a0[ghosted Safdie for several years](https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/dwayne-johnson-benny-safdie-mark-kerr-movie-1234940165/)\u00a0(\u201cBenny thought I ghosted him, and maybe I was just a f\\*\\*\\*in\u2019 asshole\u201d), but after years of not-so-great movies and a chat with Emily Blunt, Johnson called Safdie back, and now they\u2019ve made the movie. Johnson says he hasn\u2019t quit \u201cfour-quadrant blockbusters,\u201d but he needed a career reset to explore films with more humanity. It\u2019s a smart move \u2013 and it all points back to sweaty performances.\u00a0\n\n**The Numbers**\n\nWhat\u2019s really interesting is that his incredibly sweaty films have a slightly higher critical/user average than his less-sweaty movies. The differences aren\u2019t anything big, but they prove that a little extra sweat helps.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**11 \u2013 Wild Amounts of Sweat**\n\n* Tomatometer Average \u2013 55.2\n* Letterboxd Average \u2013 2.9\n* IMDb Average \u2013 6.5\n* Box Office Average\u00a0 \u2013 $249 million\n* Movies \u2013\u00a0*The Rundown, The Game Plan, Fast Five, Pain &amp; Gain, Skyscraper*\n* *Fast Five*\u00a0has the highest IMDb score (7.3) and Letterboxd score (3.4)\n* *The Game Plan*\u00a0was his first non-action film to clear $100 million worldwide\n* *The Rundown*\u00a0was his first film with a Fresh Tomatometer Score\n\nThe biggest drawback to sweat-heavy movies is that they aren\u2019t huge earners. However, when done right, they lead to bigger box office results. This is why Johnson is taking the role in the A24-produced\u00a0*The Smashing Machine*.\u00a0\n\n**9-10 \u2013 Sweat City**\n\n* Tomatometer Average \u2013 54%\n* Letterboxd Average \u2013 2.58\n* IMDb Average \u2013 6.2\n* Box Office Average \u2013 $613 million (Aside from\u00a0*Doom*, these movies make money.\u00a0)\n* Movies \u2013\u00a0*Furious 7, Doom, Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw, Rampage,*\n* *Furious 7*\u00a0is his highest-grossing film and most critically lauded\n* *Hobbs and Shaw*\u00a0is his highest-grossing film, with only one co-lead (Statham)\n* *Rampage*\u00a0is the fourth highest-grossing video game adaptation\n\n\n\n**5-8 \u2013 Gonna Need a New Shirt**\n\n* Tomatometer Average \u2013 40.9%\n* Letterboxd Average \u2013 2.48\n* IMDb Average \u2013 6\n* Box Office Average \u2013 $268 million\n* Movies \u2013\u00a0*Hercules, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island, Walking Tall, The Scorpion King, Tooth Fairy, GI Joe Retaliation, The Fate of the Furious, The Gridiron Gang, Race to Witch Mountain, Faster*\n* *Note \u2013*\u00a0None of these films feature an overly excessive amount of sweat.\u00a0\n* Only one of these films scores 60% or more on Rotten Tomatoes.\n* He hasn\u2019t made a 5-8 category movie since 2017\u2019s\u00a0*The Fate of the Furious*.\u00a0\n\n**0 \u2013 4 \u2013 Zero to Light Sweaters**\n\n* Tomatometer Average \u2013 53.2\n* Letterboxd Average \u2013 2.72\n* IMDb Average \u2013 6.28\n* Box Office Average \u2013 $356 million\n* Movies \u2013\u00a0*Southland Tales, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, Jumanji: The Next Level, Jungle Cruise, San Andreas, The Mummy Returns, Baywatch, Fast &amp; Furious 6, Snitch, Get Smart, Central Intelligence, Be Cool, The Other Guys, Empire State, Black Adam, Red Notice*\n* *Red Notice, Black Adam, and Red One*\u00a0fall in this category, and they have a 38% Tomatometer average.

The isolation, the barely perceptible bear chuffing in the background as he walks, the reveal of the bear cubs walking in front of him as the camera swings around to show the mama bear on her hind legs before she charges with full abandon. Then just 5 straight minutes completely helpless as this absolute beast mauls the shit out of him. I think Innaritu's style is the perfect vessel for this kind of scene, it's not over-the-top and there's no music but the sound design is still the star of the show and the bear is never in focus enough for any sort of goofy effects to ruin the impact\n\nIs there any scene from any other movie that can top it?",

        "content": "Hello there,\n\nyesterday, I've asked you for your most favorite movie set in Iceland. For me, it was initially exciting to see whether In *Bruges* would continue to be the only \u2018foreign\u2019 film on the list that is set in the respective country but is not genuinely from there. In fact, *The Northman,* which I thought of here, was quickly knocked off the list. Instead, it came down to another photo finish between two films that I hadn't even had on my radar because - to be honest - I hadn't even seen them before: ***Englar Alheimsins*** (engl.: *Angels of the Universe*) narrowly wins the race against *S\u00f3d\u00f3ma Reykjav\u00edk* (engl.: *Remote Control*).\n\nNo matter which of the two would have won: Somehow I have the impression that the list (which you can also find on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/)) is increasingly dominated by films from the 90s and 00s. I'm curious to see whether this will also be the case today, when I swap the c for the r and now come to **Ireland**. As always, there are only two rules in this game:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is official part of the given country today.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\n\n\n&gt;Day 21: Iceland - Englar Alheimsins (engl.: Angels of the Universe)\n\n&gt;Day 20: Hungary - S\u00e1t\u00e1ntang\u00f3\n\n&gt;Day 19: Greece - \u039a\u03c5\u03bd\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 (engl.: Dogtooth)\n\n&gt;Day 18: Germany - Das Leben der Anderen (engl.: The Lives of Others)\n\n&gt;Day 17: Georgia - \u10ea\u10d8\u10e1\u10e4\u10d4\u10e0\u10d8 \u10db\u10d7\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8 \u10d0\u10dc\u10e3 \u10d3\u10d0\u10e3\u10ef\u10d4\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d4\u10da\u10d8 \u10d0\u10db\u10d1\u10d0\u10d5\u10d8 (engl.: Blue Mountains)\n\n&gt;Day 16: France - La Haine\n\n&gt;Day 15: Finland - Mies vailla menneisyytt\u00e4 (engl.: The Man Without a Past)\n\n&gt;Day 14: Estonia - Vehkleja (engl.: The Fencer)\n\n&gt;Day 13: Denmark - Jagten (engl.: The Hunt)\n\n&gt;Day 12: Czechia - Spalova\u010d mrtvol (engl.: The Cremator)\n\n&gt;Day 11: Cyprus - Smuggling Hendrix\n\n&gt;Day 10: Croatia - Kako je po\u010deo rat na mome otoku (engl.: How the War Started on My Island)\n\n&gt;Day 9: Bulgaria - \u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0435\u0441\u0438\u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0435\u0441\u0438 (engl.: Eastern Plays)\n\n&gt;Day 8: Bosnia and Herzegovina - Ni\u010dija zemlja (engl.: No Man's Land)\n\n&gt;Day 7: Belgium - In Bruges\n\n&gt;Day 6: Belarus - \u0418\u0434\u0438 \u0438 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438 (engl.: Come and See)\n\n&gt;Day 5: Azerbaijan - Yuxu (engl.: The Dream)\n\n&gt;Day 4: Austria - Funny Games\n\n&gt;Day 3: Armenia - \u0546\u057c\u0561\u0576 \u0563\u0578\u0582\u0575\u0576\u0568 (engl.: The Color of Pomegranates)\n\n&gt;Day 2: Andorra - El fred que crema (engl.: The Burning Cold)\n\n&gt;Day 1: Albania - Lulekuq\u00ebt mbi Mure (engl.: Red Poppies on Walls)",

        "title": "Rewatched Logan Lucky dir. by Steven Soderbergh",
        "content": "I was looking through Netflix for something to watch last night and saw that they had recently added Logan Lucky. I hadn't seen it since its release in 2017 and I didn't have it held in the same regard that I do other Soderbergh movies, so I figured it was due for a rewatch to see how it holds up. By the end of this watch, I just couldn't shake how this film leaps forward to capture our world today. It's frankly impossible to watch this movie as an American after the events of last week and not come away with a firm understanding that this a picture of the rural, red part of the states, and also this is an incredibly fucking hard way to live and a tough way of life.\n\nThe entire cast of this movie gets to something that so many other movies set in the Midwest (EDIT: Not Midwest, WV and NC are both states in the south) miss in their tone, the exhaustion of it. It's exhausting for Channing Tatum to work a state away from home, and always be rushing to his daughter, and this bad knee he can't afford to ever get right. Watching Adam Driver portray an armless veteran who still can't get ahead in life because of jail time he did as a teenager is so quietly brutal. Even Daniel Craig as the Popeye-esc explosives guy has moments of real softness that connect throughout. You see it through this whole unbelievably stacked cast, truly the names in these credits are absurd, these parts of the states are beaten down, and as big industry continues to suck the money up the chain, the people are exhausted trying to keep up. It's shown plain and simply, and really who could blame the Logan's for seeing an opportunity to get ahead for once.\n\nEven in a performance I didn't love, Seth Macfarlane as Max Chilblain, he's literally an International billionaire who has forcefully made himself way too big a deal in the lives of Americans. He has decided through sheer annoying willpower to be a part of this story, and honestly that is so on the nose that it hurts my head.\n\nIf this post is to say anything, it's that I highly recommend revisiting Logan Lucky if not seeking it out for a first time. It's wonderfully made, incredibly written by Jules Asner, and can be watched as a compelling Dukes of Hazard meets Oceans Eleven thriller. But I couldn't help but approach it knowing that it's a story that gives a look into what's actually going on day to day for people living in parts of American that I'm sure feel lost in lots of our national discussion. It's entirely possible that this an overly sincere look and I'm reaching for a hand that doesn't want to be held, so let me know if so.\n\nEDIT: Thank you to everyone pointing out that this movie doesn't take place in the Midwest since WV and NC are both southern states, that's totally on me. Should've double checked with a map before hitting post. ",

        "content": "Watching Ad Astra for the second time (since 2019).  I feel it has \"Apocalypse Now\" vibes.  Loosely, maybe you can connect the protagonist hunting down someone gone rogue. But just the narration and introspection.. him questioning why he's out there, while he goes from one group of characters and set pieces to another. And traversing some hostile territories.  I'm sure there are more parallels that im missing? \n\nOverall though, it's always nice to have a sci-fi film focus more on the story than get lost in explaining all the visuals. ",

What scene had an actor absolutely nail a line delivery that made you believe they meant it. \n\nThe two examples that come to mind for me are Nick Nolte in Tropic Thunder when he says \u201cWe\u2019ll take them off the fucking grid!\u201d when he first pitches throwing the actors into the jungle on the beach. The second is Anthony Hopkins in The Edge. A beautifully shot movie with both great and hammed up acting, but when he riles up Alec Baldwin to kill the bear. They repeat back \u201cWhat one man can do another can do!\u201d Followed by Anthony absolutely killing the final line of the scene \u201cbecause today, I\u2019m going to kill the motherfucker.\u201d It always sends chills down my spine. \n\nI know I\u2019m being a hypocrite asking this, but any links to scenes that are referenced is greatly appreciated. \n\n***EDIT: Please include the name of the movie.***",

        "title": "ANORA -- and why her ethnicity mattered",
        "content": "Like many of you, I was SO excited to watch Anora from the moment I heard about it; but perhaps for a different reason. \"Anora\" is a very very traditional, old-school Uzbek name. It's a name your grandmother that was born in an Uzbek village would have (compare it to a name like Bertha, or Doris). Most importantly, it's a name that's generally recognizable to Russians as being Uzbek, or Central Asian at least.\n\nIn the Soviet Union, Uzbeks were the third most populous ethnicity right after Russians and Ukrainians. During the USSR, Uzbeks (and Central Asians in general) were seen as backwards savages compared to Slavs. Since the dissolution of the USSR, over a million Uzbeks reside in Russia as migrant workers. They face A LOT of racism and legal discrimination to the point that it's very common for most Russian landlords to explicitly advertise that they won't rent to Uzbeks. To put it plainly, Uzbeks are perceived pretty negatively and they're looked down upon in Russia. Uzbek women in particular also have a stereotype in post- USSR countries, as well as places like Dubai and India, as being prostitutes.\n\nThis is why I thought it was so brilliant that Anora in the movie was going to be Uzbek. Every single review or article about the movie initially said that she was Uzbek, so I was surprised that it was never mentioned in the movie. I recently read an article with the director however that Anora is supposed to be Russian, which honestly takes away a lot from the movie for me. It would have made so much more sense why Anora had the relationship with Russian that she did, and it would give yet another reason why Vanya's parents didn't accept her. The USSR racism against Central Asian carries over to post-USSR communities in the US. Brighton Beach, where the movie takes place, is home to half of all Uzbeks that reside in the US. I grew up going there a lot, and I remember feeling slightly embarrassed and ashamed every time I would go to Russian markets or restaurants because I'd get dirty looks for being visibly Uzbek. I always refused to identify with anything Russian even though my parents were from the USSR and raised me with a lot of Russian media/culture. I just didn't feel comfortable having anything to do with it when so many Russians looked down on my people.\n\nSo if you take the fact that Anora is a sex worker and combine it with the fact that she is from a \"low-class\" culture in Russia, doesn't it make even more sense why Vanya's mom was soo mean to Anora and rushed over there? And why Anora wanted Vanya to approve of her and defend her so badly? \n\nAlso, I just can't believe it's a coincidence that Mikey Madison looks remarkably central asian compared to the average Slavic Russian, and she was given a Central Asian/Uzbek name in the movie. I wonder if she was initially supposed to be Uzbek-American, but that aspect was later changed due to a fear of backlash from the Central Asian community? Anyways, I hope this can add some context to y'all.",
