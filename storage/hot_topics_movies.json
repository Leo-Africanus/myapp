I was wondering if I could get some recommendations for some movies that in some way glorify killing Nazis (or general white supremacists/fascists). \n\nI want something that feels like the Wolfenstein game reboots, though I'm open to more grounded films, as long as they have some form of Nazi suffering by the end.\n\nOn my list so far are three films that I feel demonstrate the vibe I'm seeking better than my words:\n\n\\- JoJo Rabbit (2019) *dir. Taika Waititi*\n\n\\- BlacKkKlansman (2018) *dir. Spike Lee*\n\n\\- Inglorious Basterds (2009) *dir. Quentin Tarantino*\n\n*(also maybe Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) dir. Steven Spielberg)*\n\nI would love a wide array of suggestions. Any setting from the 1930s to the future, in any country, in any multiverse. I'm sure there's some old WWII propaganda films that could fit the bill, or niche animated superhero from the 50s and 60s. Just remember that the Nazis don't have to be WWII German Nazis, as long as they were inspired by them. Thank you!",

        "content": "I was watching parts of the Bradley Cooper movie *Burnt* the other day, and there's a scene in which he's speaking to a rival chef with whom he used to work, and the other chef asks Cooper's character (named Adam Jones) something to the effect of \"what happened to your angelic face?\" and Jones basically responds that hard living has taken its toll.  \n\nNow, setting aside whether anyone wishes to describe Bradley Cooper or anyone else as \"angelic\"-looking, in the scene itself there was actually nothing visibly wrong with Bradley Cooper's face!  The chef looked just like Bradley Cooper looks in nearly all of his movies, which is a handsome movie star.  (Later in *Burnt*, he is beaten up, and his face is cut and bruised, but that hadn't yet happened in this scene.)  Doesn't the director or anyone else make this connection?  I know that they don't want to make their pretty-boy movie star *too* ugly, but then couldn't they just tweak the script to say something else?  \n\nAnother example is *The Devil Wears Prada*, in which Ann Hathaway's character is repeatedly described as being overweight or outright fat.  Now, yes, she was working in the fashion industry, where body standards can be unrealistic, but the character at one point describes *herself* as being \"not skinny.\"  Even by fashion industry standards, there's no way anyone would reasonably call her \"fat,\" as Meryl Streep's character does at one point.  The character looked just like Ann Hathaway looks in nearly all of her movies, which is a fit, pretty movie star.  She and Emily Blunt even commiserated on set over how hungry they both were, because she *and* Hathaway *lost weight to play the role*.  ",

        "content": "There are many movie directors who make a bad movie and manage to shake it off and continue to make another movie, but then are are directors who one bad movie and getting blacklist or in a limbo for a long  amount of time. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that one failure means getting put on the back burner (though sometimes it\u2019s not even a failure, just self imposed).\n\nThere are some filmmakers who eventually get out of it, this year even marked the comeback of directors like Gore Verbinski (Good Luck, Have Fun, Don\u2019t Die), Shane Black (Play Dirty) and Kathryn Bigelow (A House Of Dynamite).\n\nSo I\u2019m curious to see which filmmakers would you like to see get out of directors jail\n\nMe personally I would like to see Patty Jenkins (Monster, Wonder Woman) get another shot, I wasn\u2019t a fan of WW84 but i would like to see her Rogue Squadron Star Wars movie. I would also like to see Mark Romanek (One Hour Photo, Never Let Me Go) get another shot.\n\nWhat are your choices and why",

        "content": "John Frankenheimer directed this and 30-odd years later directed Ronin. It's a tense WW2 action drama starring Burt Lancaster as Labiche, a French rail master trying to prevent the Nazis from looting French artworks. Paul Scofield is the perfect antagonist trying to secure the French treasures for Nazi Germany.\n\nI first saw this about 40 years ago as it was one of my father's favourites and I have to agree. It's tense, emotional, plenty of action, and beautifully shot, with great performances by everyone. Special mention to Papa Boule (Michel Simon) for just being a hero and Jeanne Moreau as Christine, the hotel owner who gives refuge to Labiche. \n\nWatch it and you won't be disappointed. It's a Desert Island Discs kind of movie IMO.",
