Their unexpected meeting becomes the catalyst for change, igniting a spark of possibility in Tove's dark world. As the two grow closer, Tove is forced to confront the very demons she's been running from. Can Jesse's unwavering support and love be enough to pull her back from the brink? Or will Tove\u2019s inner turmoil ultimately push her further into the abyss?\n\n&gt;In a story about second chances, healing, and the power of connection, Tove must decide if she\u2019s ready to rewrite her story before it\u2019s too late.\n\n![img](wya1ggph3rfe1)\n\nWe're an open book and look forward to your questions!\n\nJocke and Sven",

Of course the original movie required going through the entire gameplay sequence but it's still possible that dying wouldn't have killed you in real life.",

I still haven't gotten around to the James Bond and John Wick films though.\n\nBut oh man, the Mission: Impossible movies might be some of the best action movies of all-time. The first one may be the slow one out of the whole series but even 2 isn't a bad movie in general despite being the worst of the Mission: Impossible movies. Fallout even blows most of the Marvel movies out of the water besides for Captain America: The Winter Solider and Spider-Man: No Way Home. It's surprising to me that Tom Cruise does his own stunts for all of the Mission: Impossible movies, if someone like Brad Pitt or Bruce Willis were Ethan Hunt, they wouldn't do most of their own stunts. And the most divisive movie of the series, Dead Reckoning is still actually a really good movie besides for IIsa's death. Just really good movies around.\n\nI really hope that Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is actually the best Mission: Impossible just because of how good it looks.",

        "content": "It's unfortunate it didn't do as well as some of the more popular Eddir Murphy movies because Bowfinger is probably among his top 5 movies ever. Then again, thank god it didn't do a lot or else we would have had a couple of mediocre sequels. \n\nThere isn't a single flaw in this movie. Even the set-up of the unknown dorky twin works because the writing is so good and Murphy plays it up so well, either as the narcissistic egomaniacal asshole Kit Ramsey with his endless rants about not being appreciated or racist paranoia (he mistakes Shakespeare for Shake a Spear), or the geeky Jiff who's used by the untalented director, Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin), as a occasional body double for Kit Ramsey, in his movie \"Chubby Rain\". Bowfinger decides to direct a movie by filming Ramsey without him knowing about it.\n\nHe also has aging actress Carol (Christine Baranski), who doesn't know when to overact and wants to have sex with Kit Ramsey, Daisy (Heather Grahame), an aspiring and ambitious actress who can't act but will do anything to go up in her career (said to be a diss directed at Anne Heche whom Steve Martin used to date), Afrim (Adam Alexi Malle), a Videostore owner who helps fund Bowfinger's ambitions among others. \n\nThe film also features strong supporting turns from Robert Downey Jr (during his \"I'm cancelled Junkie\" phase) and Terence Stamp. \n\nA highlarious movie. The highway scene is a classic. It always gives its audience an uproarious laughter.",

I enjoy pretty much everything about that movie but damn if Renner taking that last guy up the mountain, taking his shoes, and giving him \u201cthe same chance she had\u201d isn\u2019t just a phenomenal cherry on top of a triple scoop of slow burn sadness. \n\nWhat are some other *chefs kiss* revenge scenes?",

The more melancholic, subtle and contemplating the better. Bonus points if they're Korean/Japanese (or Asian cinema in general). \n\nTo give you a better example of what I'm looking for here's a couple I can think of I've seen already: Bleak Night, After My Death, A ghost story, Aftersun, Arrival, Taste of Cherry, Knockin' on Heaven's Door, I'm Thinking of Ending Things, Fountain, Synecdoche New York, Nine Days, Stand by Me, Demolition, The Father, Another Earth, Third Star.

        "content": "Famous romantic movie of course, the music, the pottery, etc. That early scene with Unchained Melody is one of the most romantic sequences ever filmed. \n\nAnd it\u2019s also not novel to highlight Whoopi, who won the Oscar here. \n\nBut upon rewatch, it really is an impressive performance.  Whoopi is absolutely electric in this movie. She bursts in like lightning and so smoothly carries the tone from comedy to drama and back again and she pulls that off effortlessly even in individual scenes. \n\nIt\u2019s a brilliant performance and again she won the Oscar so it\u2019s not underrated or anything, but I think it\u2019s often viewed as a sort of silly performance or even a Magical Negro (ess) one, but it isn\u2019t anything like that. She\u2019s just so warm and just so alive, it\u2019s wonderful to rewatch after so long. ",
