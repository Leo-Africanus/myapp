The question it's asking hasn't changed. But I finally have enough relationship history to understand that Joel and Clementine at the end aren't a love story - they're a warning. They know what happens. They've seen the whole movie. And they do it anyway  \nKaufman builds that ambiguity in deliberately. The film is simultaneously the most romantic and the most unsentimental thing about love I've ever seen\n\nWhat film changed completely for you between a first and second viewing - or between seeing it young and seeing it now?",

One of his fun nicknames for Edgerton, whose name is Gordon, was \u201cGordo the Weirdo.\u201d This apparently caught on with the other kids.\n\nOn the page as childish insults go, it seems relatively minor, but it (among other things) sticks with Edgerton for the rest of his life.",
