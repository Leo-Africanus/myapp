Past films include Citizen Ashe, A Crime on the Bayou and The Rape of Recy Taylor. My latest, HARLEY FLANAGAN: WIRED FOR CHAOS, tells the story a punk/hardcore legend, Harley Flanagan. AMA!",
        "content": "Howdy, r/movies! I'm Rex Miller, director of HARLEY FLANAGAN: WIRED FOR CHAOS. Harley Flanagan founded the hardcore punk band the Cro-Mags. He is currently the bassist, vocalist, and sole remaining founding member of the band.\n\nTrailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojOfP12Glok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojOfP12Glok)\n\nFrom August 8-15, there will be a limited time digital event for HARLEY FLANAGAN: WIRED FOR CHAOS \u2013 it will be available online for viewing at either https://wiredforchaos.com or https://geni.us/WiredForChaosEvent; aside from the film, the online event also features a Cro-mags performance Live at Hellfest 2022 and the Opening Night post-screening Q&amp;A.\n\n**ABOUT WIRED FOR CHAOS:**\n\nFounder of the pioneering band Cro-Mags, Harley Flanagan is a punk rock/hardcore legend who\u2019s defied the odds \u2013 along with neglect, sexual abuse, drugs, violence and PTSD -- and lived to tell the tale.  The feature-length documentary, HARLEY FLANAGAN: WIRED FOR CHAOS, dives headfirst into the wild life and times of this larger-than-life icon and is a no-holds-barred ride, that isn\u2019t just about the music; it\u2019s about a man forged in fire who\u2019s lived to tell the tale. \n\nRaised by a Warhol Factory \u201cit\u201d girl, Harley was thrown into the Lower East Side\u2019s underground scene in the \u201970s. Left to fend for himself, by his teens, he was squatting in Alphabet City, stealing food, dodging gangs, and living in a world that he describes as \u201csome serious Lord of the Flies shit.\u201d But, as his life descended into a hellish day-to-day, he was simultaneously becoming a punk rock legend: at the age of 11, he was drumming at CBGBs and Max\u2019s Kansas City with his aunt\u2019s band, the Stimulators. Sex, drugs and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll weren\u2019t a choice \u2013 they were survival.   But Harley was a fighter. Whether on stage, in the streets, or in the Jiu-Jitsu gym with Renzo Gracie, he never backed down. As the ferocious frontman of the Cro-Mags, he pushed NYC Hardcore into uncharted territory. But violence, addiction and a traumatic past left deep scars. The streets made him, but they also nearly destroyed him.\n\nDirected and Produced by Emmy and Peabody Award-winner Rex Miller (Citizen Ashe) for Rexpix Media, and produced by Laura Lee Flanagan, Elisabeth Haviland James and Rex Miller, HARLEY FLANAGAN: WIRED FOR CHAOS, WIRED FOR CHAOS dives deep into Harley\u2019s past, but it\u2019s not just war stories. It\u2019s about what happens after. Friends like Flea, Henry Rollins, Ice T, Roger Miret, Keith Morris, Michael Imperioli, Matt Serra, Jocko Willink, Darryl Jenifer, Glenn Danzig, Brooke Smith, Marcia Resnick, Kate Schellenbach and the late Anthony Bourdain reveal the man behind the legend \u2013 confronting demons, raising a family, and sharing the knowledge of his experience to help others.  Harley Flanagan didn\u2019t just live hardcore \u2013 he is hardcore, and WIRED FOR CHAOS is his story \u2013 loud, unfiltered, and real as hell\n\n**REX MILLER BIO:**\n\nFilmmaker Rex Miller's documentary career spans more than twenty five years. He recently directed (with Sam Pollard) the film Citizen Ashe (CNN Films), which premiered at Telluride and won Best Documentary at both the 2022 Critics Choice and Grierson Awards and was nominated for a Sports Emmy for Best Feature Doc. Miller was a frequent collaborator of Nancy Buirski\u2019s, shooting six of her movies before her untimely death in 2023. His work has aired on Netflix, American Masters/PBS, American Experience, Starz, ESPN, Hulu, Apple TV and played many high profiles festivals including Sundance, Tribeca, Telluride, Venice, New York Film Festival, London Film festival, SxSW and DOCNYC.\n\nAsk me anything! Back at 4 PM ET tomorrow (Thursday 8/7) to answer your questions.",

        "title": "Terminator 2: Judgement Day is the gold standard of utilization of both practical and digital effects.",
        "content": "In T2, The T-800 (Arnold) was 100% practical effects. The T-1000 (liquid metal Robert Patrick) was about 50% CGI. In fact, many of the scenes that general moviegoers assume may be CGI are actually practical. \n\nIn the hospital chase when Robert Patrick is being shot at, he has tiny holes in a shirt - devices are hidden inside them, that when operated via remote control, they expand outward through the hole revealing the metal plate, aka gunshot. The elevator blast was a dummy on a spring. The shotgun blast through the windshield of the nitrogen truck was a dummy. The blade through the hospital security guard was a real blade on a dummy's head from the back view. Eye hole was a dummy. The loss of legs when frozen was a amputee stuntman. CGI was only used when we see him in metal form reverted back to his Robert Patrick mode, the bullet holes reverting to normal on camera, the bar scene, the helicopter morph, and a couple of other shots.\n\nIf T2 were made today, not only would the T-1000 be 100% CGI, most of the T-800's effects would be CGI, too.\n\nIt's the gold standard for me because they only used CGI when practical was not possible, like things that are liquid taking shape. For mechanical structures like a machine, you don't need it, as a machine can be built. For puppets like Chucky, you don't need it, because animatronic dolls can be made.  Now it's used for almost anything that isn't human. ",

        "content": "WARNING: MAJOR Companion Spoilers ahead\n\n\n\nI'm one of those people who refuse to watch trailers.  It annoys the hell out of my wife.  But anyway, I knew nothing at all about the movie Companion other than Jack Quaid and the poster.  Which had a girl with white eyes.  No idea why.\n\n\\*Spoilers\\*\n\nI'm watching it, and I see this dude's girl get shit on by his friends and then almost raped and she has to kill to protect herself.  Then people rush to help the rapist. And I'm like \"wtf?\".  Then, he shuts her down and my jaw hit the floor.  I had no idea she was a robot and they did such a good job hiding it until then.  \n\nFast forward and, then I learn that it was on purpose and that this is actually a murder/heist. Second turn I didn't see coming. \n\nAfter watching the movie I decided to see if the trailer spoiled anything.  And. I guess it's hard to market a robot murder movie without a robot in the trailer.  But the reveal in the movie was amazing. And then they show the millions in cash and spoil the heist part too!  \n\nAnyway, I really enjoyed the experience of watching the movie and it kills me that anybody who saw the trailer wouldn't experience the same movie I did.

I thought, \"This is a voice, this is a brain working in concert with voice, and this is someone who loves storytelling in cinema.\" You could just tell right on the page. So I was ecstatic to get to be any part in that film. And it just so happens the way he cast it, I would randomly text Tony Tost and be like, \"Hey, what about so-and-so for this or that?\" I do that with everything I act in, whether I produce or not. I'm always just giving ideas and trying to be helpful. And Tony knew exactly who he wanted for every role. And he was really dogged about knowing what he knew and sticking to his vision. And then when I saw the movie, I was like, \"Oh my God, he got great performances out of everyone.\" There's no weak link in the bunch. It's a film that is so dependent upon the writing and the actors, you know? We don't have any big budget-y stuff to throw at you. So it really had to work, and like I've been saying in all my press, I think it's the best movie I've ever been a part of. I really, really do.",
