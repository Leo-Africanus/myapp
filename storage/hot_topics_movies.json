Long after everyone else has moved on, I'm still thinking about all the elements that go together to make this one-scene masterpiece. It's not just her performance (though that's the major part). It's how Batman and Catwoman and Jim Gordon are talking to her through a truck window, and at a lower height too. Just the absurdity of standing around outside a semi, looking up, listening to someone poignantly die. I think Cotillard understood the assignment: this is camp, so that's how I'm playing it.
