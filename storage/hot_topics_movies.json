        "content": "I have seen the trailer \"Cleaner\" starring Daisy Ridley and it seems that the filmmakers have taken cues from the film \"Die Hard\". However, I've noticed something when others are taking inspirations from the said film. John McLane is basically a normal cop who is just trying to fix his marriage to his wife who is working in the building that he came in. When the hostage ensues and his wife is one of those hostages, he was forced to take action. Yes, he beats some of the bad guys, but he's hurt and bloodied a lot (and almost half-naked to say the least), and on the verge of giving up (he knows he's gonna die but he's afraid of it). These are the reasons why I loved this character. He's vulnerable but he's determined to his job especially when he has to save his wife. Films inspired by \"Die Hard\" are pretty entertaining in terms of action but they don't have the main character that we supposed to root for.",

My favorite role of his is the Nihilist in The Big Lebowski, but he does have a hilarious role in an episode of Leverage where he is a German filmmaker making a documentary of a card company (in the style of The Office)!\n\nWhat roles of his do you like?",

        "content": "Movies don't always strive for historical or scientific accuracy, but sometimes they do, only for new information to emerge later that changes the academic consensus and it turns out it wasn't actually accurate after all.\n\nFor example, back in the day, historians mostly accepted that the\u00a0Titanic\u00a0sank whole (some witnesses had insisted that it had split in two though, but it was dark and hard to see so their testimonies were considered unreliable). As such, movies used to depict it sinking in one piece. But in 1985, the wreckage of the Titanic was discovered and it was proven that the Titanic had split in two, and as such movies released afterwards, especially the\u00a0James Cameron\u00a0movie, have depicted sinking it accurately.\n\nThe public perception of dinosaurs mostly comes from what we've seen in movies, and a lot of it is because of\u00a0Jurassic Park\u00a0. The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park mostly looked like what scientists thought that dinosaurs looked like at the time. But in the decades since, it has been discovered that dinosaurs probably had feathers. Despite this, newer Jurassic Park movies still depict most dinosaurs as not having feathers, and so do most movies with dinosaurs really, it's just what audiences are used to at this point.\n\nSo what other depictions used to be considered accurate but later weren't due to new information?",

        "content": "Just watched Kubo and the Two Strings, a masterpiece from Laika \u2013 the stop-motion studio that gave us Coraline, Paranorman and Missing Link. I can\u2019t believe this movie is real. I\u2019m watching behind the scenes videos in awe of how the characters we see were indeed physical figures whose limbs were moved a fraction of a fraction of an inch by the animators.\n\nStop motion is insane by itself, but if we look at the works from Aardman - the creators of \u201cChicken Run\u201d and \u201cWallace &amp; Gromit\u201d (which I love, btw) \u2013 we can see the movements are not as fluid, and that\u2019s part of their charm. Not to mention the LEGO movies, whose characters are stiff by nature. Kubo\u2019s characters, on the other hand, are so fluid they look like CGI. (In fact, they used a lot of CGI for the backgrounds, and the movie was nominated for a VFX Oscar - the only animated film besides Nightmare Before Christmas to get this distinction.)\n\nAlso stop motion characters are usually dressed in tight clothes and have steady hairdos to make them easier to animate \u2013 but in Kubo, they\u2019re using kimonos and have long hair; plus, there are animal characters and one of them is a MONKEY with fur. That means the animators had to move the kimonos and each hair strand (or the fur, in the monkey\u2019s case) individually for every frame. And they placed that monkey in the middle of a snowstorm!!! They had to manipulate every single piece of that fur 24 times to end up with a second of footage.\n\nKubo is a very touching and beautiful film too, and I recommend it for its storytelling appeal as well. But I\u2019m mostly here to praise the achievement by itself. Seriously, I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes.",

        "content": "I was watching Easy A on Netflix and aside from being one of the best comedies of the 2010's I can't help but notice how exceptional the lighting is. It really brings that essential warmth and sunny brightness of California that I miss seeing in movies to the full front and it looks so natural to the eye. Maybe I'm glazing it but I just miss that type of quality lighting in movies. The type of lighting that can something simple like a parking lot or a teenager's room look really cinematic and alive.

Struggling to find a good link, but MAN Donnie Wahlberg just CRUSHES this character in around 1 min of screen time. What a powerful scene to start that movie.\n\nI'm curious what other great examples of this people might be able to think of.",
