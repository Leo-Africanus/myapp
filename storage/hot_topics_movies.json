They cared about them that much. Now, in space year 2026, apparently every professional association of filmmakers give not one solitary shit about credits, allowing as they do every single streaming platform to shrink them to Borrower size so they can Run Some Fucken Adverts. \u201cYes you just watched Schindler's List for three hours and change, but stop processing it there\u2019s not a moment to lose, have you heard about *House MD*? We're gonna play it in 5 seconds unless you tell us not to.\" \n\nThis is Apple\u2019s own movie, these are their people, and they couldn\u2019t even wait for the animations to stop. Like the disrespect afforded to the standard white on black scroll is bad enough, but there are visual effects going on in that little box. You paid vfx artists real human money to make this look good, not enough, granted, but you paid them, and then you made it two inches tall. Morality obviously doesn\u2019t sway these people but how are their shareholders not beating down the door at the sheer waste of it?\n\nNetflix is particularly bad now too, some people will say \"hey you can just make it bigger again\" (as if ruining the vibe alone were not sin enough) but on both Smart TVs and Xbox, the only two places I've bothered testing, going over the \"back\" arrow to get to the tiny credits crashes them all together, like they're punishing you for even questioning their wisdom. How *dare* you try to find out who the best boy is.\n\nAnd just so Disney+ doesn't escape here, when I was watching season 2 of Andor last year their title images for next episodes which pop up unprompted over the credits \\*included spoilers\\*. If anyone has the address for the person who did that, stick it in the comments, I just wanna talk.\n\nI am quite unreasonably mad about this and I don't expect them to change how they do it, but boy I\u2019d sure take an option in the settings, off by default no doubt, that just says \u201crespect the goddamn films you dorks\u201d with a little checkbox.",

But as he stated in the scene, he knows her well enough to know (or just assumes the worst outcome from his own end) that she would get mad that he doesn\u2019t want her to be apart of the things he does alone. Also she calls him wanting to hangout with his friends more than spending time with his family is worse than cheating, and that him not doing things with her like going to see a Spider-Man movie together is \u201cmean\u201d.\n\nWhen we have so much stuff going on in our lives that we need to tackle like with work, family along with other responsibilities on our plate. Alone time is just really helpful where we need a break from it all.\n\nEDIT: I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t think that his character was 100% in the right in that scene. His desire for alone time is relatable, but the way he handled it was wrong, so no I\u2019m not defending his lying! Communicating your values with your partner and making sure you\u2019re on the same page is very important.\n\nIt\u2019s wild to me how people on the internet seem to think that understanding where someone is coming from, is equivalent to thinking they\u2019re also in the right.",

        "content": " just realized it\u2019s been 10 years since The Force Awakens was released in China (Jan 2016). I remember watching it during my winter break when I was just a 7th grader in China. Now, I\u2019m about to graduate from university.\n\nOver these ten years, I\u2019ve managed to watch every single Star Wars movie, but I\u2019ve always noticed a huge gap: While the world goes crazy for Star Wars, it remains a niche interest in China.\n\nAs a local fan, here are my thoughts on why:\n\n1.The \"Latecomer\" Disadvantage: This is the biggest factor. When A New Hope blew everyone's minds in 1977, China was in a completely different era. We missed the \"Big Bang\" of Star Wars. By the time it officially entered the Chinese market, we were already being flooded with CGI-heavy blockbusters like Transformers and the MCU. We don't have that \"childhood nostalgia\" or \"cultural DNA\" that Western fans have.\n\n2.Space Opera vs. Hard Sci-Fi: For many Chinese audiences, the \"knights, princesses, and feudal bloodlines\" trope feels more like a Western fantasy story set in space rather than \"futuristic sci-fi.\" Without the emotional bond to the Skywalker legacy, the \"I am your father\" moments don't hit as hard.\n\n3.High Barrier to Entry: To truly enjoy the sequels or the Disney+ shows, you basically need to have watched the previous six films. For a casual moviegoer in China, that feels like \"homework\" rather than entertainment.\n\nI\u2019m curious to hear from you guys: Do you think Star Wars will ever have a \"second chance\" in markets like China? Or is the cultural gap and the lack of early exposure too wide to bridge?\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts! ",

        "content": "Obviously, we're all here because we love movies. However, I think a key part of that experience is the petty-yet-undeniably-righteous thrill of seeing a critic or fan tear into a truly terrible flick. Negative? Granted. Often a thing of beauty? Definitely.\n\nMy favourite, and a contender for greatest of all time, is this autopsy of Steven Seagal's *Contract to Kill:*\n\n&gt;Seagal...walks stiffly and very slowly. It is possible that he never once bends at the waist. Most of the movie, he spends sitting down or walking (again, slowly) up and down flights of stairs. There is a love scene - and, Jesus, what a love scene. His fully dressed body is lowered over a naked woman like a drawbridge.\n\nhttps://www.avclub.com/contract-to-kill-isn-t-just-bad-it-s-steven-seagal-bad-1798189772\n\nSo, movie fans...what reviews live in your head rent-free?\n\nEDIT: So the number one thing I'm taking from the replies is that Roger Ebert was the John Wick of film criticism; a man of focus, commitment and sheer will. \n\n*\"Baba Yaga...\"*\n",
