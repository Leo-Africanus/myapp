        "content": "Hey\u00a0[r/movies](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/)! We're Courtney Stephens and Callie Hernandez, the filmmakers of the recent meta-fictional feature INVENTION which riffs on real circumstances to explore the relationship between fantasy and grief -- both in personal life and how it reflects externally in America today. The film deals with weird medicine, losing dads and the emotional logic of conspiracy theory against the bucolic, literary backdrop of the Berkshires in the fall.\n\nSynopsis: In the aftermath of a conspiracy-minded father\u2019s unexpected death, his daughter receives his patent for an experimental healing device. Featuring archive from actress Callie Hernandez's actual late father, INVENTION explores the process of grieving a complicated parent, and the filmmaking itself becomes a part of the process.\n\nTrailer:\u00a0[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFtolT9DE6M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFtolT9DE6M)\n\nWatch on MUBI:\u00a0[https://mubi.com/en/us/films/invention-2024](https://mubi.com/en/us/films/invention-2024)\n\nAsk us anything!

        "content": "X-Men: Origins had a different director than James Mangold granted, but hotdog water level writing and questionable FX made it borderline unwatchable. Then Mangold takes the reigns in The Wolverine, which while an improvement also suffers from a generic to downright bad third act that feels slapdash and rushed compared to the rest of the film (the director\u2019s cut helps this somewhat). Then we get Logan, which IMO, is the best genre film aside from The Dark Knight (and Nolan\u2019s trilogy had its own stumble with the enjoyable but flawed Rises). \n\nIs there any other trilogy that was so miles ahead of the first film? Or is Logan the only exception to this rule? \n\nEdit: I should preface, as rightly pointed out (thank you folks) that the trilogy could be defined loosely in this sense \u2014 but these were the three stand alone outings as Jackman\u2019s Wolverine so, to that end, that was my metric for defining them as such and also because they do acknowledge events from the film. I believe they even tried to get Lieve back as Sabretooth and modeled X-24 after his look from Origins. So to that end, I don\u2019t discount it. ",

Not a single frame is wasted.\n\nIt's quite remarkable how this movie is going this way till interval, and then going back post interval and packs so much story in between its never ending action. \n\nHardy &amp; Theron nail their part but Nicholas Hoult character win the movie for me. \n\nBefore this movie, I never expected a movie to be all action. You expect movies to set a plot, to set up characters, to set up story, MMFR does everything without slowing down, and that's art for me.\n\nIt's like a video game where you follow the main character. It's like a heavy metal song you love. It's like the best TV series payoff you wait to happen for years. It's legit perfect. \n\nFrom the ridiculous guitarist belting riffs Iron Maiden would be proud of to the pole swinging assassins, it's just a feast for all senses. \n\nAnd, dare I say, if you little high, there not exists a better adrenaline inducing movie.\n\nCheers.

She had to sit through it every time. Then it became one of those movies that you just see on TV and start watching again. Then I would rewatch it as an adult as just an amazing bad movie to laugh at. All in all, I've certainly seen it more than a dozen times. There were also all the movies we had on VHS and DVD, like the first Pokemon movie and Over the Hedge that I'm also sure I've seen a dozen times.

        "content": "I decided to jump into Richard Linklater's well-regarded Before trilogy as I recently finished the Normal People series and have been in the mood for melancholy romantic stories. Before Sunrise was really, really good - charming, romantic and captured that exuberance of doe-eyed youthful passion so well.\n\nBut Before Sunset, man, it's just on another level. Maybe it's because I'm the same age as the characters now, in my 30s and married and with some life experience but it felt so resonant. Jesse and Celine have grown and changed over the past decade - they're more jaded and cynical, and not the hopeless romantics they used to be. But this growth is what lends so much more depth and complexity in both personalities and the current state of their relationship, and how much that one night steered the course of their lives in the ensuing years.\n\nAs with Sunrise, the dialogue is really the star here and it's even better than before. Whereas in Sunrise, Jesse and Celine's conversations leaned more towards more fun and youthful and often idealistic, sometimes pseudo-intellectual (makes sense given their age), here they're tinged with a melancholy and occasional bitterness that can only be brought on by experiencing more of life. In Vienna, Jesse and Celine talked about art and love and literature and all these grand, human-condition concepts. Here, they talk about global warming, crime and broken romances. It's actually crazy just how well the script captures just how I've myself been feeling in my 30s.\n\nEthan Hawke and Julie Delpy's chemistry is as amazing as ever, and really sell the whole concept and premise.\n\nAnd that ending? Absolutely perfect. Jesse knows he's going to stay. He's probably known it all along.\n\nCan't wait to finish off the trilogy with Midnight",

It makes you really feel each of the characters, and I respect it for that, even if it did make for a uncomfortable watch. I already know that not everyone likes it, but I truly think everyone should try this movie at least once in their life. Also the soundtrack is dope lmao. Also for fans of harmony korine and Larry Clark, do y'all think gummo is a good watch",

They meet discreetly with someone who's in charge (who they think is not crooked) and tell them what they found. And that person in charge says \"Does anyone else know about this?\"  It drives me nuts. It's a question that translates directly to \"Do I need to kill anyone besides you to keep this from getting out?\" Their motive is extremely obvious, especially if it's the first thing they ask. And the MC always says \"Nope! Just me!\" ",

        "content": "I think the first rated R movie I ever saw was when I was 5. My dad let me watch The Shining with him as long as I promised to not wake him if I had a nightmare about it. I remember telling my friends at school the next day how awesome the movie was and how a guy got hit with an axe. From then, my dad would always let me watch any R-rated movie, and then would just cover my eyes if there was any nudity in a scene. If there was a sex scene, he'd send me out of the room and tell me come back later (these were always movies playing on tv, so he had already seen them and knew when those scenes were coming up). The only movies I wasn't allowed to watch were slasher horror movies, mainly because they just knew that'd give me a nightmare. Once I was in like 6th grade or so, they were fine with me watching those.\n\nWhen I talk to others about that though, that apparently wasn't the norm with everyone. I personally liked it and thought I'd be fine with doing the same with a kid, but I'm curious what y'all's experiences were.",
