        "content": "We are **Janty Yates** (Costume Designer) and **David Crossman** (Costume Designer \u2013 Military Costumes) and we had the pleasure of working on Ridley Scott\u2019s new film, Gladiator II. We\u2019ve both spent decades working in the industry, garnering awards, and working on some of the biggest movies in Hollywood.\n\nWe\u2019ve been on Ridley Scott projects previously, and between the two of us, we\u2019ve worked on franchises like Harry Potter, Star Wars, and Alien. With an eye for detail, and a love of storytelling, our passion for outfitting the right actors in the perfect wardrobes is very special to us both.\n\nIf you want to know more about the process, the methods, and the artistry of costume design for big, epic movies, we\u2019re here to take your questions.\u00a0\n\nWe are:\n\n* [Janty Yates](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0946765/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1731688586703178&amp;usg=AOvVaw3l_HfawFgp6Rgx07DWbfZl), Costume Designer. Yates has worked in this field since 1989 and has two Academy Award nominations, including one win. Gladiator II marks Yates 18th collaboration with Ridley Scott\n\n* [David Crossman](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0189366/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1731688586703575&amp;usg=AOvVaw382KB9AjxnnfM3CtG96Jeu), Costume Designer \u2013 Military Costume. Crossman has worked as a costume designer since the late 90s and has one Academy Award nomination for Napoleon, which he shares with Yates.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6rn3v7kv731e1.png?width=1988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9248ede2359a90b2ca141dbe26e0fb993ece6c1d\n\n&gt;Thank you all so much for joining us and asking so many wonderful questions about our lives and careers. \n&gt;This has been such a memorable experience for both of us.

        "content": "Just watched for the first time a few days ago so I'm late to the party but wow. I could go on and on about the cool intricacies of the time loop paradox but what hit me the most was how sad Jane/John's story is.\n\nAll her life she wishes to be loved. The only time she experiences it, she is quickly abandoned by the man. The next time she experiences that love is as John when he comes back in time and realizes he is the man she falls in love with. John gets to experience the same love all over again, but is forced to abandon her knowing the pain it will cause. Then as a temporal agent, he has to set Jane and John up, knowing the outcome.\n\nThe final scene of the movie where he says \"you are the best thing that ever happened to me. I miss you dreadfully\" hit me the hardest. Realizing that he's talking about him/herself. The only love Jane/John have ever and will ever experience is from themselves. It's so strange and sad. \n\nI would argue that he goes insane and becomes the fizzle bomber to maintain the paradox, not out of self-preservation but because he wants to make sure the love he experienced happens. idk y'all it's just sad to me. The majority of Jane/John's life is spent in isolation, orchestrating some cosmic self-cestuous love story that barely lasts a few weeks. ",

I really liked the premise of this ancient evil being held prisoner by an ancient order only for Nazis to kill them and accidentally release it, and a subsequent fight to lock it back up. Great 80's soundtrack and cool visuals, especially the evil being. However the movie feels chopped in half and stapled back together, with massive jumps in story. It doesn't recover and so I understand the movie's low rating.\n\nI feel this movie would be perfect to remake. They could set it in Syria or Iraq where you'd have a similar play out with an ancient evil being released during the war and destruction of the cultural sites. Showcase some of the ancient Mesopotamian evil monster mythology. You could really play into the horror.\n\nWhat would be another example you feel for a movie deserving of a remake?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Fans of this movie may know that the events take place in November, the perfect time to put a log on the fire, add more pepper to the soup and immerse yourself in the decline of empires, class struggle and a little bit of murder on the side.  Say farewell to Maggie Smith and Michael Gambon, hold on to your Bloody Mary, sit back and watch the fun.\n\np.s.  around 1:40 the camera pans by a desk calendar that displays November 16, so this IS the perfect time to watch the movie.",

        "title": "The Adventures of Baron M\u00fcnchausen(1988) - The life of a story",
        "content": "So, a few years ago, I was able to watch for the first time the amazing movie called \"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, and it blew me away. However, whenever I tried to read about it online, people only ever seemed to talk about the hellish production and how much of a bomb it was, which, sure, that's interesting, but no one seemed to discuss the story!\n\n  \nI don't know how many of you have seen this movie, but to me, its main theme is the phenomena of transmission. This can be seen with the Baron (who is supposed to be an in-universe fictional character) who starts the movie as a decrepit old man but, through his adventures with the young girl Sally, he starts to get rejuvenated, his hair unwhitens, his face uncrinkles, as he is being ressucitated through contact with the younger generation, much like a story.\n\n  \nI'm not sure how much of this theory is purely me overanalyzing the movie, but it seemed so obvious to me. The Adventures of Baron Munchausen tells the life of a story, of the way culture stays living. It's all about the importance of telling stories. In fact, this movie both discusses transmission and acts out transmission at the same time! \n\n  \nBecause who remembered Baron Munchhausen, the old german tall-tale-teller? I didn't. But that movie allowed me to learn about his existence and read his stories (which bangs btw go read it especially the version with the Gustave Dor\u00e9 illustrations). It was able to transmit the story of the Baron onto me, and so I have read some of his stories to my younger cousins.\n\n  \nAnyway, didn't really want to write such a huge wall of text, but I mostly wanted to discuss the story of the Terry Gilliam movie about the Baron. What do you guys think about the story? Am I just overanalyzing?",
