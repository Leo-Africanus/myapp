She's confident, strong, such a stealth personality that being a woman isn't a problem, the guys respect her and play around with her as she is able to show she's better than any guy around. And she never shows fear or vulnerability, she's always shooting them guns and taking the risks. To the end, she's a hero. I love that character, probably more so than Ripley whom Vasquez teasingly calls Snow White.",

Sometimes I feel like I understand a characters motivations and emotions better than people i\u2019ve known for years.\nI think movies let us see their inner world in a way real life doesn\u2019t.\n\nDoes anyone else get weirdly attached to a character because of how real they feel?",

        "content": "The following are my favorite film composers at the moment:\n\n1. Ludwig Gorannson - I have been a fan since his work on Community and New Girl. He has only gotten better since then, particularly his collaborations with Ryan Coogler and Sir Christopher Nolan. Easily the best in the business right now.\n\n2. Michael Giachino - I saw Zootopia 2 last week and was reminded just how brilliant Michael is. I also recently watched Lost for the first time and was amazed by just how much the music carried the show.Not to mention his Pixar triple threat of The Incredibles, Ratatouille and UP.\n\n3. Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir - Her work on Joker and Chernobyl alone says a lot. I am hoping to see a lot more from her in the future, hopfully with a Denis Villenueve film .\n\n4. Justin Hurwitz - Huge fan of his jazz inspired soundtracks in his various collaborations with Damien Chazelle. I think he might be outgrowing their partnership though because while Babylon was somewhat underwhelming, the score imo deserved the Oscar over All Quiet On The Western Front.\n\n5.Alexandre Desplat - pretty much anything he does with Guillermo Del Toro or Wes Anderson sounds gorgeous. Special shout out for the score of the recent Frankenstein which was wonderful.\n\nHonorable Mention: Nicholas Brittel for the absolutely fantastic scores of Succession and Andor\n\nWho are your favorite composers right now?",
