It shows the pressure, secrets, and power struggles that happen behind closed doors during an important religious event.\n\nSome people might say the ending is easy to guess, but that did not bother me. The journey is more important than the surprise. The movie does a good job showing the weight of each choice the characters make.\n\nRalph Fiennes was amazing in this movie. He did not need big speeches or action scenes. His face, his voice, and his small movements said a lot. He made his character feel real and thoughtful.\n\nThis film may not be for everyone, but if you enjoy serious stories and good acting, I think you will enjoy The Conclave.\n\nCan anyone recommend some similar movies ?",

        "content": "I just saw warfare, I\u2019m gonna try and be as spoiler light as I can.. where do I start. Warfare is not a movie, it\u2019s an experience. I have never in my life felt that overwhelmed and stressed by a movie. The sound design is unforgiving and overwhelming and loud. The movie barely has a story (compared to something like saving private Ryan or lone survivor), but it doesn\u2019t need one. The point of the movie is not to tell you a riveting story about a squad that gets pinned down and makes a miraculous effort to escape. The point of this movie is to drag you to the deep end and try and drown you. With a run time of 1hr 35 minutes, it feels like it\u2019s about 40 minutes long. You get so sucked in and feel like you are there. The movie is insanely fast paced. I love war movies, and this one might take the cake for the most intense and overwhelming war movie I\u2019ve seen. \n\n\nI can see and appreciate where people come from if they say they don\u2019t like it. There really isn\u2019t a story, there\u2019s not really a beginning, middle, or end to what you are watching. It just kind of starts. To me, this is why it\u2019s called warfare.. that\u2019s what you\u2019ll witness watching it. That\u2019s what it\u2019s about. I think out of the entire cast my brain remembered two character names. \n\nSorry for the long rant. Just finished watching it and just kinda trying to put together words for what I just experienced, if you enjoy the war movie genre, go see it. It\u2019s worth it. I\u2019m curious to hear opinions from people who have seen it as well. ",

        "content": "Asterix is a beloved French comic book series created by writer Ren\u00e9 Goscinny and illustrator Albert Uderzo, first published in 1959. Set in 50 BC, it follows the adventures of a small village of indomitable Gauls as they resist Roman occupation. The titular hero, Asterix, is a diminutive but cunning warrior who, alongside his loyal, super-strong friend Obelix, defends their village with wit, bravery, and a magic potion brewed by the druid Getafix, granting temporary superhuman strength. Obelix, perpetually strong due to falling into the potion as a child, carries a menhir and loves wild boar and brawls.The series blends slapstick humor, clever wordplay, and historical satire, poking fun at Roman bureaucracy and cultural stereotypes while celebrating Gaulish camaraderie. Each album sees Asterix and Obelix embark on quests\u2014whether thwarting Caesar\u2019s schemes, exploring foreign lands like Britain or Egypt, or protecting their village from internal strife. The comics are renowned for their vibrant art, memorable characters like the tone-deaf bard Cacofonix, and timeless appeal across generations. Translated into over 100 languages, Asterix remains a cultural icon with comic books fans around the world!",

        "title": "End of Humanity movies?",
        "content": "I love contemplative fiction, and story scenarios that wrap up characters in a \"last moments of the human species\" type of stuff, where if humanity ended, what did it all boil down to?\n\nI swear I almost cried finally watching the movie Artificial Intelligence with my mom. It was Stanley Kubrick's final film that ended up transferring to Steven Spielberg. It goes in truly unprecedented directions I didn't (but should've) excepted that are characteristically Kubrickan.\n\nI've just rewatched Sunshine and I'm thinking of Space Odyssey 2001. Now I'm watching some horror films because I'm in the mood for darkness.\n\nBut I get a little impatient with horror as it often turns into either a slasher flick or a mystery with a killer or a monster in it. I think what I really wish I had more of were movies that take us to the philosophical end of life as we know it, and explore that horrific fantasy.\n\nI'm just super inspired by \"what if\" scenarios about what humans would do if Earth could no longer be inhabited or some other extinction event.\n\nWhat are some \"end of Humanity\" movies you liked?",

        "content": "SPOILER ALERT: if you do not know what either of these pieces of art are, i suggest reading/watching them.  *Owl Creek* has also been made into a film that was hosted by *The Twilight Zone*.  watch that too!\n\n[*An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge*](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Occurrence_at_Owl_Creek_Bridge) has been one of my absolutely favorite pieces of writing ever since my very first reading.  \n\ni was hooked from the start and then when i saw the [*Twilight Zone* episode](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Occurrence_at_Owl_Creek_Bridge_(film\\)) i knew exactly what i was watching immediately!  so friggen good!!!\n\nanyway, i had both read, and watched, the two official versions of the story years before i finally watched [*Jacob's Ladder*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob%27s_Ladder_(1990_film\\)) and for some reason it did not hit me that the stories are the same...  do bad, get killed, see shit, die.\n\nand looking at the *Owl Creek* wiki it lists adaptations but does not mention *Jacob's Ladder*.\n\nam i wrong comparing them?\n\nit seems like all the themes are met (depending on how you feel about the Vietnam War, i guess) and that at the end the main characters meet the same fate...  dying after hallucinating a whole lot of unlived life.",

The performances by both lead actresses were fantastic.  I liked the theme of generational familial mental illness, and I like horror movies that inevitably end in horror for the characters.\n\nNot perfect, but a really solid film in the folk horror genre.\n\nWhat do you think of it?",

Not even any of the working scientists there seem intrigued by it or wanting to find out. This film would have been way better if that was a main part of the story. ",
