        "content": "I\u2019m a young woman who has been through COCSA (child on child sexual assault) by my older sister, who herself has been sexually assaulted by my grandfather as a child. In my early teens, i was molested as well, which made worsened my mental state. I feel really guilty and ashamed because I\u2019ve had many immoral and lustful thoughts since childhood because of that. I\u2019ve had suicidal thoughts as a child and attempted a few times back then, even as a teen, last time attempting being last year. I\u2019m doing my best to not get consumed by my thoughts and I\u2019ve started self harming instead. My parents aren\u2019t aware of any of this (SA, attempts and self harm) but i told them about my suicidal thoughts, which my mom got upset at me for, saying that God would be disappointed in me, etc,  they won\u2019t let me get therapy either because they believe religion will help (which i agree with) but I\u2019ve lost motivation to even practice Islam; praying. It\u2019s the only thing currently stopping me from doing bad stuff, i am afraid of Allah and of going to hell. Even when i try really hard, i lose motivation not even a week later. I still have a strong faith but i have an extremely hard time praying. I have other reasons to be mentally unstable that i won\u2019t dwell on here, but i assume that the major reason is my sexual trauma. (COCSA happening when i was less than ten, maybe around 8 my memory is very blurry, i don\u2019t have a good memory to begin with, and i was molested at 13).\n\nI feel guilt on a daily basis and im scared that God will forsake me and never forgive me because I\u2019ve been having really bad thoughts (homicidal urges, surges of anger, etc) which are turning me into a bad person, i don\u2019t want God to be disappointed in me. My parents don\u2019t take my mental health seriously, i am unable to keep practicing even when i want to. I don\u2019t wanna justify everything i do or did  but i just need an opinion from other Muslims. \n\nSorry for the long post, it was also kind of a vent. ",

        "content": "Salam everyone, i hope this message finds you all well. \n\nrecently ive been doing alot of retrospective thinking and i realised im not practising ie religious for the sake of allah. i became closer to allah at the beginning of last year when i had the most horrible time of my life and i had a national exam that year and basically had no friends and had to endure bullying at school as well which made me skip school often and i turned to religion as a way to cope. \n\n\nnow that its 2024 im not currently studying as i did badly for my national exams and im here pondering why does everything keep going bad for me. i alao have very abusive parents that beat me till i bleed (for context im 17 and a girl and they beat me once bc i bought a body scrub without telling them) and i have to deal with bullies and as a result suffered alot and has ruined my mental helath to the point i genuinely want to die and prayed to die even. because suicide is haram. i feel so trapped and i became even more religious earlier this year because i believed it was because allah hated me and was punishing me with a difficult life whereby everything goes bad and my non practising muslim friends succeed by going on to very good schools and have a good social life and good grades and im here suffering with bad grades and family despite trying my absolute hardest with my eroded mental health.\n\n\nnow i know that some people have it worse everyone has their own set of problems. i do istighfar and salat tawbah and salat duha everyday and life is still not getting any better (in an attempt to seek forgiveness even tho i did not do any of the bad big sins) so im really confused. im contemplating on taking a break from the deen and slowly learn to love it again because i love the peace it once brought me and want to feel it again but dont know how.  sometimes i feel disillusioned with the deen after seeing so much hypocrisy and im starting to feel like whatever this person said in the picture",

I have tried many times to stop and am getting better, and I believe very soon I will stop forever. Brief backstory is that I was exposed to a lot of sexual content at a young age (which I would say is in part due to a lack of sex education, which led to trying to find answers on the internet), and now here we are.\n\nThe issue is that I had no clue that you had to perform ghusl after doing it until very recently, so not only are my fasts invalid, probably most of my prayers in the past five years are too.\n\nNow, I did the maths, and if I were to pay the meals for every day of those five months, that would be around $30K I believe. I have no clue how I would even start paying that, and I can\u2019t lie I\u2019m terrified.\n\nNow of course, I can make up the fasts. That would be five months of fasting which I will do because obviously I put myself in this position, but I just want to check if that would be valid? \n\nPlease don\u2019t judge. I swear I\u2019m trying to be better, and I feel so, so, so much regret. Thankyou.",

They told me general information and I started researching later on my own. I\u2019ve been reading books and watching podcast every evening ever since and felt so good. I learnt a lot and started appreciating everything that Allah SWT was giving me and how I was taken care of all this time. I started recognizing that I\u2019m one of the creation as everything here in this and next lifes.\nBut today after I did my first 2 prayers I have been crying all evening. I\u2019m not sure why but I remembered every bad thing that has happened to me, so I called my mom and she told me that my dad started drinking again (he is not Muslim). I feel like it\u2019s my fault and I should pay a price of protecting my mom since my dad has anger issues when drunk and has physically abused her before.\nI really feel like I should stop praying and following Islam until I would solve the problem with my dad since it\u2019s really selfish to focus on personal beliefs at this moment. I\u2019m just so confused why this problem occurred at the moment when I wanted to feel closer to our creator and pay all my attention to that. Is it possible that this is a guidance that timing is not right and I should focus on other things first? ",
