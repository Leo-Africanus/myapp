        "content": "As we approach the upcoming US election, we\u2019ve noticed a significant increase in political posts. While politics can be important, we want to ensure this subreddit remains a space for genuinely interesting and engaging content. Unfortunately, the surge in political posts has led to more spam, less interesting submissions, and a rise in uncivil behavior.\n\nTo maintain the quality of content and the positive vibe in this community, we will no longer allow political posts until after the US election is over.\n\nThis means:\n\n**Any political posts will be removed.**\n\n\nThank you for your understanding and cooperation! Let\u2019s keep this space full of the awesome, mind-blowing content we all love.\n\nStay interesting!",
