        "content": "There\u2019s a reason Perez put a 1B buy clause on him. During last injury prone season, he stepped up and delivered as the CB at interim. Big games and league games, fantastic performances and passion in excess\u2026 Despite the questionable performance in the CWC, the potential of Raul is enormous. Everyone seems to have shoved him under the rug after the two bad games. I honestly believe he could become a Ramos type defender for Madrid with enough finetuning and training + experience. He\u2019ll probably serve as a sub for Militao or Huijsen\u2026. Although Xabi is really flexible and determines lineups tailored to opponents so maybe in 3CB\u2019s we\u2019ll see him play and Tchoua back in supportive midfield role. If he gets the playtime he needs and is able to be more careful we\u2019re in for a treat.",

        "title": "Analysis of Rodrygo's inconsistency / Rodrygo Rant (LONG POST)",
        "content": "The reason im making this post is because i dont think i've ever seen so many fans defend such an incredibly inconsistent player in all my years of being a Madridista, it's very strange to me.\n\nI think at some point we need to be honest about Rodrygos inconsistency as a player. The ''hes playing out of position on the right wing'' excuse has been around for years, but the reality is hes been at Madrid for five seasons now and has played the majority of his games on that side. If he hasnt adapted by now, i dont know what to tell you. Also, he has the exact same inconsistency problem when he plays on the left, so why are we attributing this to something about what side of the pitch he plays on? \n\nRodrygo has a clear history of disappearing for long stretches. [There are periods where he will go 15 games without a goal](https://i.gyazo.com/4dd70ccb5107d64c10a50975f900abbf.png), which is not acceptable for a starting attacker at Real Madrid, the thing i linked above was from the insane 23/24 season, and [heres something from 22/23](https://i.gyazo.com/890c4767c80f2722fa1b1e9a9f1ae924.png) and [heres something from last season](https://i.gyazo.com/1f882bd04a677989aa19bfb486cf7336.png). I could also show the 21/22 season where he didn't score his first league goal until April, but i dont think Rodrygo was a real starter up until right at the end of that season.\n\nAnd its not just when hes on the right wing in some of those games, he's been played on the left and still failed to deliver. Right now, like i showed you, he hasnt scored a league goal since January. Before that, yes, he had his usual hot streak where he scored and assisted in a few games in a row and showed us how fucking amazing Rodrygo can be. But if you go back before that run, he didnt score between September and December. Its a pattern we've seen season after season short periods of great form, followed by long droughts of not really doing much at all. People want to say he's out of position, sure, but why is it that in the 22/23 season, when Benz was injured a lot, we put Rodrygo in the middle, and his usual hotstreak in ~December-January happened, why did that happen while [he was playing through the middle](https://i.gyazo.com/83df0eb5a5723ae1c682eed202a1a2ef.png)? Wouldn't he be out of position there too? How come he randomly performed, is it because he's inherently an inconsistent player, where his position doesn't really matter too much?\n\nAnd theres this narrative that he works harder defensively than players like Vini or Mbapp\u00e9, which i just dont think is true at all and it unironically triggers the fuck out of me because its an easy excuse people can use that people wont really be able to accurately check if its correct or not, if that makes sense.\n\n [The data](https://i.gyazo.com/8254d0cb337c78242ef22323025ca94d.png) from last season, and from [our most recent CL season](https://gyazo.com/f69cc34cea537f17dbcc4c8ee8745b79), shows that, yes, he might do a bit more than them, but it's by a very small margin. Its not like he's putting a crazy amount of work more every match and exhausting himself, the difference isnt enough to say thats why he's underperforming. That excuse just doesnt hold up, same with the pressing/running thing, [nothing shows that he's some insane presser](https://i.gyazo.com/dfb70fc0cc9ae7c3429a45470283ee48.png), most things are [gonna show that he does run more](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoUxq_EWQAAZQ9_.jpg:large) but not really [by much at all](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSyO1A5dnMKzSY6JT8iSccyu1tqi9rjLWVGrQ&amp;s), but i guess all the Rodrygo stans are just gonna say that im watching football through stats or whatever else, i dont really know what else to cite when im making a post like this.\n\nIm not saying Rodrygo is a bad player or that i hate him, i think literally every Madrid fan loves the fuck out of him. He's obviously very talented and can be decisive when he's in form. But at some point, you cant keep giving a forward at Real Madrid a free pass for being invisible for months at a time, i dont think i've ever seen another Madrid player get such a free pass like him, i think a ton of this subreddit are too young to know or are just more recent fans, but a player like Benzema got fucking grilled like crazy in both the 16/17 season and the 17/18 season for being inconsistent, literally on of our most upvoted posts during those years was [''1 upvote = 1 apology to Benzema''](https://www.reddit.com/r/realmadrid/comments/6afgnd/1_upvote1_apology_to_benzema) because people were endlessly shitting on him, myself included in 2018. It feels like a lot of people are just so in love with Rodrygo because of stuff like the Chelsea and City goals, plus the CDR final goals, i will forever love Rodrygo for those too, but im not gonna be blinded by my love for him.\n\nSo when people say stuff about how Rodrygo should start on the left over Vini..... Why exactly? I dont know in what situation you'd ever take a gamble on Rodrygo somehow becoming a consistent player when he gets to play on the left, and also matching/being better than Vini, who for 4 seasons straight has put up 40+g/a, even in his last season, which was a bad one, and i think has broken the record for most G/A in the CL knockout stages, showing that he's a big game player. Like in what world do you ever say ''Hey Vini, i know you were consistently the best LW in the world for 4 years straight, but since you didn't perform well in the last half of the season, we're gonna bench you for the guy who guy who hasn't performed consistently in either of the 3 attacking positions, because apparently he runs more than you, sorry king''. Like you guys are either blinded by your love for Rodrygo, which i am guilty of too in the past, or you're just delusional. This guy is not good enough of a player to force us into  4-3-3, our best formation, as we saw in our most recent double and in a lot of the games last season when Carlo finally benched Rodrygo, is a 4-3-1-2, with Vini and Kylian up top with Jude/Arda behind them, i dont see what Rodrygo does that warrants us changing our entire formation just to fit him in.",
