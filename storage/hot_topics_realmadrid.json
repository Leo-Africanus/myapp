        "content": "I understand why some people think Arbeloa\u2019s constant praise of Vini is a bit weird or over the top. But honestly, I think it\u2019s very intentional and very pragmatic.\n\nVini\u2019s confidence is clearly at a low point right now, and like it or not, this team still needs him firing if we want to win anything meaningful this season. Everything is still wide open, especially with Barca dropping points. The margins at Real Madrid are always thin, and when Vini is hesitant or mentally checked out, our attack looks predictable and toothless.\n\nYes, the criticism he\u2019s getting is fair. His decision-making hasn\u2019t been great, his body language hasn\u2019t helped, and he hasn\u2019t always responded well to pressure. But singling him out endlessly doesn\u2019t help the team. At this stage of the season, it\u2019s not about who was right or wrong, it\u2019s about putting players in the best position to perform.\n\nI genuinely think Arbeloa is trying to protect and empower Vini, not because he\u2019s blind to his flaws, but because he understands how crucial Vini is when he\u2019s confident and decisive. Whether you\u2019re a Vini defender or a critic, the reality is the same: if he plays well, Madrid\u2019s chances improve dramatically.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to like him. You don\u2019t have to excuse everything he does. But right now, backing him is simply the most pragmatic move for the team\u2019s success, and that\u2019s probably all Arbeloa is doing.",

It seems the board gave up on this season and the league for no apparent reason, yet Barcelona dropped points today\u2026\n\nWould Xabi truly have lost in the Copa del Rey?

        "content": "I saw today\u2019s highlights of Endrick and I have to say that he might be better playing as a RW than a striker.\n\nHe has so much pace and physicality that is much needed for that position. Meanwhile we got Franco who just cuts inside and then passes backwards.\n\nFranco is still young but I truly believe that Madrid loaned out the wrong guy.\n\nHopefully when Endrick does come back he will get minutes playing on the RW since the striker position is occupied and doesn\u2019t seem like vini will be subbed off any time soon with the new manager.",

        "content": "I\u2019ve read many opinions, quite crazy takes and transfers, but I\u2019m not sure big changes will happen. I think this may be an approximation of what could happen, how wrong/right you think I am?\n\nDEFENCE\n\nBring a stablished, older, experienced CB until Militao is back to help Huijsen (he was playing fairly well with Militao imo). Give minutes to both Asensio and Huijsen. Rotate the three of them so the guys can learn from an experienced player, while building up their synergy.\n\nMIDFIELD\n\nArda did really good passes against Levante, but Ceballos is not good enough. Bring the best creative midfielder you can, put most of the money in this transfer. I\u2019d say Arda-Tchouameni-Vitinha (just to say a name, but I think it\u2019s rly unlikely) would make much more sense than Tchouameni-Camavingha or Dani Ceballos.\n\nATTACK\n\nI think we should get back Endrick and sell Rodrygo. I honestly never liked Rodrygo, and I\u2019ve been in discomfort with Endrick not having the same opportunities as others.\n\nPut Gonzalo as a 9, and either choose between Mbappe and Vini for the LW, or let Mbappe behind Gonzalo so the CBs are fixed to Gonzalo, and Mbappe can receive more balls. I\u2019d choose the first one because Mbappe won\u2019t defend even if he\u2019s not the 9.\n\nWhatever happens, we NEED to sell forwards. We got too many players who play the same position or the same way, specially as forwards. Even Bellingham and Valverde share that scoring goals feature. This team currently feels like playing career mode.",
