I'm mainly looking at the official website and entradas com website.\n\nI know that tickets open almost a week before the game kick-off date. For the Madridista premium members, ticket sale opens one day before the general public category. I'm wondering if this would give me more chances to find a ticket rather than waiting for the general public tickets.\n\nThanks!!",
