        "title": "[Match Thread] UD Ibiza - Real Madrid Castilla | Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Matchday 31",
        "content": "#FT: IBIZA 0:0 CASTILLA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#1\u00aa FEDERACI\u00d3N\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:**\n\n1' - kickoff, vamos! \n\n33' - first big chance for Castilla - Borja Alonso is through on the right side and his cross is deflected to the edge of the box - there, Gonzalo has lots of time to shoot, his weak footed but powerful effort is saved nicely by the keeper though\n\n35' - the Ibiza keeper slips on the ball and Borja tries to poke it into the net - the referee whistles for a foul which I don't understand, if anything it was illegal obstruction by the keeper who had it clamped between his legs\n\nHT - Castilla were the more dangerous team away against 3rd place Ibiza in the first half, but like so often recently, a few percent of penetrating power and efficiency in offense are lacking - the defense looked solid, but the team needs to give a bit more in the second half if they want to end the streak of 5 consecutive draws\n\n\ud83d\udd04 46' - rate half time sub from Ra\u00fal, Borja who was on a yellow is off for Z\u00fa\u00f1iga \n\n53' - former United and current Ibiza player Beb\u00e9 takes a powerful shot from a tight angle, but de Luis dives down quickly and parries it away\n\n\ud83d\udd04 71' - Valde on for Yusi\n\n73' - a cross by the Ibiza winger is way too long but becomes dangerous that way, it flies over de Luis and hits the post - luck for Castilla \n\n77' - now Pol Fortuny hits the post on the other side! Great play on the counter by the team and Pol receives the ball at the edge of the box, he tries to surprise the keeper at the near post, but the ball hits the post \n\n\ud83d\udd04 86' - Victor off for Campos, David Jim\u00e9nez off for Loren Aguado \n\n90'+1 - best chance of the game for Ibiza, great play by their striker to put his teammate through in a crowded box, but his finish is a big awkward and goes wide of de Luis' goal\n\n90'+3 - and yet another massive chance for Ibiza, but de Luis comes off his line in time and reaches the ball before their attacker can finish or dribble past him\n\nFT - final whistle, and that's the 6th draw in a row for Castilla, who are incredibly still unbeaten in 2025, but reaching the playoffs is still becoming more unlikely dropping so many points. Castilla were the more dangerous team throughout most of the match, but in the very end Ibiza had the biggest chances to win it in added time, so a draw is a result the team can be happy with - the defense is looking solid with Jacobo leading the back line, but the attack, especially Gonzalo, are going through an unusual drought\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 12:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadi Can Misses, Ibiza \n\n**Referee**: V\u00edctor P\u00e9rez Peraza\n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 2, Matchday 31\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[FEF TV](https://feftv.com) (subscription - 12.99\u20ac/month)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (5-2-3): Mario de Luis - Youssef Enr\u00edquez \u2018Yusi\u2019 (71' V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as 'Valde'), Edgar Pujol, Jacobo Ram\u00f3n, Mario Rivas, David Jim\u00e9nez (86' Lorenzo Aguado) - Jos\u00e9 Maria Andr\u00e9s \u2018Chema\u2019, Pol Fortuny - Gonzalo Garc\u00eda, V\u00edctor Mu\u00f1oz (86' Andr\u00e9s Campos), Borja Alonso (46' Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga). \n\nBench: Diego Pi\u00f1eiro (GK), Quique Ribes, David Ruiz, Antonio David. \n\nUnavailable: Fran Gonz\u00e1lez (first team call-up), Ra\u00fal Asencio (first team call-up), David Cuenca (pubalgia), Manuel \u00c1ngel (red card suspension), C\u00e9sar Palacios (ACL tear), Jeremy de Le\u00f3n (shoulder injury). \n\nCoach: Ra\u00fal\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** DDDDD\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 9th | 41pt | 9-14-7 | 46:31\n",

I get that G\u00fcler is the flashier name right now because of his fanbase but let\u2019s be objective: Nico Paz is the one who looks more committed to actually developing and earning his spot in the long term. He\u2019s leading the charts for most chances created in Europe\u2019s top 5 leagues for under 21 players, and he plays for 13th place Como. He already knows our team, he\u2019s trained with the first squad, he\u2019s had minutes with them, he understands the dynamic and the expectations. That matters. We have a buyback clause of 8 million this summer. I\u2019ve been seeing a lot rumours of him being linked with Inter lately and Serie A fans really rate him. I think it\u2019d be a real shame if we don\u2019t bring back a youth player.  ",

        "content": "Hello,  I hope it is okay to post this here. In the fall, my boyfriend will turn 50, and I plan to take him to a Real Madrid game. I want to make the day special for him and wonder if anyone has any ideas. We are traveling from Norway.\n\nWhat would you include in a special day for a Real Madrid fan? What would you want in a day like that? Does anyone know of any special places he would love to visit before the game, related to football? If it matters, he is fluent in Spanish, so language is not an issue.. \nAre there any football pubs or merchandise stores we should visit?",

I have read about all the controversy he created by joining Madrid from Barca. I wanna know how good he was as a player.",
