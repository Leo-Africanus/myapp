You know what they have in common? \nWe signed them for a long ass time, for a huge salary and for years they fell off the power curve and we had to pay their wages instead of improving the team. \n\nIm scared we will do the same with vini. We renew him for 5/6 years. He'll play 2 more good seasons and then when he's past that 27 y/o his burst speed is gone and he'lls Slowly get worse. Now we stuck with him and huge salary instead of refreshing the squad. \n\nThis is why vini leaving is better, despite me thinking he'll overcome his bad form. ",

Atleast Mbappe actually performs consistently(for now). \n\nHow any manager is supposed to make changes when they can realistically rotate 6 players. \n\nHow Guler reacted was wrong but he is a kid and when one of the captains does this, he would learn too. \n\nHonestly,   \nWouldnt it have been better to bring in Gonzalo Garcia for Vini, put Mbappe on the wings?\n\nThe moment Xabi's time ended was when Vini threw his tantrum and the board supported it, but I bet Vini and his friends hated Xabi from the beggining for being to strict, for wanting to rotate more, for demanding more from the players. \n\nWhat makes me sad is that, we were 7 points ahead of Barca while having a team that did not back the manager. Imagine if they truly backed him!!!!!!",

        "content": "We lost with a horrible performance yesterday, and it hurts a lot, especially when it\u2019s against a team that is fighting relegation. But football is unpredictable. Even big clubs like PSG, who once won the sextuple and were considered unstoppable, are now struggling and sitting around 11th place. This shows that no team stays at its peak forever and that some matches are simply tough \u2014 not just physically, but mentally as well. Players are human. They feel pressure, fatigue, criticism, and expectations. They don\u2019t step onto the pitch wanting to lose. They want to win because victories bring pride, recognition, and satisfaction, not just money. When things go wrong, it\u2019s often more about confidence and mentality than a lack of effort.\n\nIt\u2019s easy for fans to say that players are only here for money, but the reality is more complex. Many of these players receive massive offers from Saudi clubs and elsewhere, yet they still choose to play for Real Madrid because of what this club represents. Yes, the loss hurts deeply \u2014 I couldn\u2019t sleep properly either \u2014 but we have to remember that they lost too, and it hurts them as well. Booing our own players only makes things worse. Just like we expect support from friends and family when we are at our lowest, our team also deserves backing during difficult times. This is their club as much as it is ours, and standing by them now is what true support really means.",

Yeah, he knows what to do with the ball, but under pressure he crumbles. He has no physical and he gets bullied of the ball easily. Then we have Alaba, Ceballos, and Mendy who just occupy space on the bench or in the hospital. When it comes to actual World Class players we only have two, Courtouis and Mbappe. How did we get to the point where we need to overhaul midfield, defense and the right wing? Our situation will not start to change until we get rid of players who bring nothing, and start bringing PROVEN players. Not some 17 year old South American, but someone who we know for a fact is good. The fact we did not even try to get Guehi still haunts me, and we dropped 60 on mastantuono, crazy. ",
