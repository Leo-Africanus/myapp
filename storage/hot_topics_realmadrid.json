The player, now a key figure on the pitch and the team\u2019s top scorer, is asking for a top-level salary of\u00a06\u20137 million euros, while Juventus has offered just under 5 million (he earns 1,7 million euros plus bonuses atm). \n\nArsenal has recently made approaches and is fascinated by the Juventus number 10, though the club has never set a sale price and he remains under contract until 2029.\u00a0\n\nAmong all suitors,\u00a0Real Madrid stands out as one of the most interested clubs. Xabi Alonso is a long-time admirer, having already wanted Yildiz during his time at Bayer Leverkusen. He has now\u00a0recommended Yildiz to Real Madrid, which continues to monitor his performances closely. Until Juventus and the player reach an agreement on the renewal, further enquiries from major clubs \u2014\u00a0with Real Madrid at the forefront\u00a0\u2014 are expected.",

One day we are incredible and SOO BACK next day we are horrible and Xabi needs to go.\n\nSame thing for Vini and Xabi, they hugged and this sub: yeah see the media was lying they love each other. \n\nAre you seriously this delusional? There are things going on behind the scenes and it's obvious. Maybe they talked and found a solution. But don't act like there has never been something going on\n\nBe happy about our win but stop acting like everything went fine. It didn't. Mbappe turned up and decided he wanted us to win the match. This didn't look as convincing as most of you act. A more lethal striker of the opponent would have changed this game incredibly fast \n\n",

        "content": "First of all, don\u2019t get me wrong\u2026 Valverde is my favorite player at Real Madrid (especially after Modri\u0107 left), and I\u2019ll always be one of his biggest supporters and admirers. Even if his level drops a little, Fede remains an indispensable player for the team, and I don\u2019t agree with those who constantly criticize him and consider him one of the problems the team is suffering from.\n\nBut I can\u2019t hide the feeling that something has changed in the player\u2019s personality on the pitch\u2026 I\u2019m not talking about his performance right now, but about his character and mindset. You can feel that the current version of the player is \u201cvery dimmed and depressed\u201d and I notice it in his facial expressions\u2026 in his reactions to what happens on the field, especially when celebrating with teammates, or when he misses chances. You feel he\u2019s much less energetic than he used to be. There\u2019s a clear coldness in his current demeanor \u2014 when he talks to players, when he argues with referees\u2026 and that\u2019s unfortunate, especially since he\u2019s one of the team\u2019s leaders, and I've always considered him the heart and soul of the team. \n\nI don\u2019t believe everything that\u2019s being said about a conflict between him and Alonso. I know the press will write just for the sake of writing\u2026 It would be easy for Alonso to bench him and replace him with another player (with all the options available) if he wasn\u2019t satisfied with his level or behavior. But there\u2019s definitely something going on, and I hope I\u2019m wrong.\n\nAm I the only one who feels this way?",

Our aerial play this season hasn\u2019t been good, but last two games he scored a header and assisted one with the head. Was it just accidentally or are they specifically training to improve it.\n\nHowever this is a good sign from the team.",

        "title": "Xabi Masterclass Today. LFG",
        "content": "Maybe it's too early to be excited, but today was a step in the right direction.\n\n\\- Playing the formation that best suits our existing set of players, and starting what I think is our strongest team.  \n\\- Focusing on making our front 2 dynamic rather than rigid. Instead of asking Mbappe to play as a typical 9, we allowed him and Vinicius to switch positions between LW and CF and even RW.  \n\\- Timely subs. Gave Rodrygo decent minutes IMO. It's the first time in a while I really felt he was given a reasonable chance as a sub.  \n\\- We also gave GG decent minutes as a Mbappe replacement. Something Xabi usually wouldn't do. After a MOTM performance and 2G+1A, there's no reason to leave Mbappe on the pitch when we can use those minutes to help GG stay sharp. Good call.\n\nThe only issue I have is with Brahim Diaz's introduction. I personally don't think he's worth the investment, and I think those minutes would be better spent on integrating Endrick into the squad. However it's only a slight inconvenience. I'll trust that Xabi knows better in this case.\n\nAlso, Vini &amp; Fede aren't playing great right now and need to get into form. It gets really scary for the rest of Europe when they get back to their best. Vini especially has earned enough trust to be given a bit of time, but pressure's on him to step up fast. If we continue to play this system, he'll have no excuse. I'm sure he'll deliver in no time, however. Things looked promising today.\n\nGoing forward, I think Xabi needs to work with the 4-4-2 and focus on improving fundamentals in and out of possession. This is what we were so excited that he would bring to the team. It's important to remember that we can play to our existing team's strengths while still improving their general play and understanding. There's no use trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Once those fundamentals are ingrained maybe we can try different formations to see if improvements are possible, but we should never be stuck on a formation or \"system\" if it doesn't improve our players, unless we plan to sign entirely new players to replace them.\n\nCourtois is the GOAT of course! And Mbappe looks so much better when he's given more freedom. In seasons where we have success, he'll definitely be our best player about 60% of the time. Brilliant player!  \n  \nHala Madrid! Celta Vigo next.",
