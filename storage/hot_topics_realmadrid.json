        "content": "There is an agenda in this sub that I've kind of ignored for a long time but I just want to address real quick. I'm not going to beat a dead horse, yes we all agree that Vinis reaction to being subbed was not a good one and yes he should have received some sort of punishment (only reason I can think is the board saw it as passion rather than dissent) but still you should never disobey your manager like that but putting that aside.\n\nThe actual reason we have been doing way worse after that is actually because of losing Militao and everyone in this sub is so blinded by their hate of Vini they refuse to see whats obviously in their face. Militao was a general in the defense and a leader on this pitch, he was able to drive the ball up, can pass really well, great in the air both in defense and attack, and anyone remember that rocket he scored when the team was struggling, he also had that in this locker. \n\nHe was a reliable presence in the back line and was very aggressive, didn't give strikers an inch, and when lost him, we replaced him with dean the twink that gets dribbled by anyone and everyone. That is why Rudiger was rushed back even though he wasn't injured because Dean wasn't trust but guess what, Rudiger got injured again because of that. \n\nAll you had to do is check how many matches we won with Militao and without. We played more matches with militao and have a better win percentage also. In the Atletico match where we lost 5 - 2, it was 2 2 before Militao was subbed off and ended up getting spanked 5 2. \n\nPeople give out about Valverde not being a creator in the the midfield but neither was fucking casemiro, people praise Alonso even though he's the one that dropped Guler when Bellingham returned and wasn't fit and kept trying to mold guler into a deep lying playmaker when the twink is obviously a free roaming attacking mid. Valverde is a key part of the mid whether you like it or not, his job is to assist the defense and help in transition not fucking dictate like Kroos.\n\nIf you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree and all that. My point is our attack isn't the problem, doesn't matter if Mbappe, Vini and Rodrygo score boat loads of goals every match if the midfield is unbalanced and defense can't defend to save their lives. Yes we will win some matches but that match against benfica for example, we don't lose that match with Militao on the pitch. ",

It'll be strictly objective analysis. How many of you guys would like to see something like this?

        "content": "There is so many thing wrong in this video. Dean lying down on the ground knowing that rayo are going to counter attack. Mbappe throwing hand in the air knowing that he can track him. To be honest It is bound to happen because you can't simply change the habit of the player. I love mbappe a lot but thing like this make me question a lot of thing. From past la liga games he is looking so stiff. He loses the ball more often and refuse to cover the space. Even against benfica arda had to move up to cover the diagonal space of benfica cb and cm. If mbappe did not bother to do that then we could've extra man in midfield which is something we needed against benfica. There is a reason why team make a lot of channel run against the team for which mbappe plays. Edin Terzi\u0107 ( Dortmund coach who took them to ucl final 2024 ) also explained that mbappe lack of defending attitude boost their plays A LOT. You will always see our opponent make channel run with their 10 or 8. I know at the end of season this thing will be ignored because ofcourse someone else will get blamed but its not coincidence that our chemistry is 50% worse than what it used to be in 2024 ucl winning season. What do you all think about this? Pls give me your opinion as well.\n\n  \n",

        "content": "I really don\u2019t understand the hate on Mbapp\u00e9 everywhere and moreover in this sub. People tend to compare him to Ronaldo where there is no point to do it with the goat.\n\nRemember also that CR7 had actually legends surrounding him while playing in RMA and I don\u2019t think you can compare the current roster to the likes of Bale, Benzema, Toni Kroos, Luca Modric, prime Isco, Sergio Ramos, Pepe, Angel di Maria\u2026.\n\nI read a lot about his lack of defense, which I can agree, but isn\u2019t he a striker? Do we expect striker who\u2019s averaging more than 1 goal per game to handle defense? It really reminds me of Juventus fans telling it\u2019s CR7 fault while the team was so much worse than what he used to have even if he was top scorer of Serie A.\n\nAlso bear in mind that they are all playing every 3 days and if he were to attack and defend every time, trust me you\u2019ll not see him healthy a lot. You can see how many times Jude was injured and still is while he\u2019s physically more than gifted. Football is not NBA, and you cannot put on a bench a player to rest and expect him to come back later in the game.\n\nJust a rant because I\u2019m kind of sad and annoyed to see all those negative comments with people who know football through instagram reels or are playing too much FIFA.

You're telling me all it takes is a few sources to say that he was against xabi and now the whole fanbase turns on him and whistles him while he's injured? Because as far as I know I never saw any tier 1 sources say he was against xabi so all this hate I've been seeing since last month is mind boggling. ",

GG  \nLW. Mbappe  \nRW. Rodrygo (Franco has been buns sadly)  \nAM. Guler   \nLDM. Camavinga  \nRDM. Tchouameni  \nLB. Carreras  \nRB. Fede  \nLCB. Huijsen  \nRCB. Raul  \nK. Thibo\n\nKey Subs:  \n\\-Ceballos for Camavinga  \n\\-Brahim for Rodrygo or GG  \n\\-Franco for GG or Rodrygo\n\nTactical Changes:\n\nI would like to see more fluidity in our defensive rotations, which imo would really help the counter-press, transition defense, and build-up too. Camavinga has really excelled when inverting from the LB position. I would like to see Carreras do this more (not like Vini uses his overlaps and Carreras is too afraid to unerlap into the congested left half-space that Mbappe and Jude love to occupy as well)\n\nWith Carreras and Camavinga rotating and switching seemlessly it can create mismatches and confuse man-man marking or find gaps in positional pressing. I would like to see this more from Fede as well on the right, I want him to naturally flow into the midfield whenever Tchouameni gets stuck inbetween CBs or can't cover the ground fast enough. \n\nOne Alternative:\n\nFrankly, our other injuries do not really allow this to happen but I would not mind seeing a front two of GG and Mbappe up top with a diamond. This would mean we would be able to play Fede in the midfield, maybe even in a Jude type role off the left. But this is contingent on Carvajal being fit enough to play the majority of the match. ",
