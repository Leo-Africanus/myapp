        "content": "I really think our last ten years have been shaped by that crazy 9248 goal in the 2014 Champions League final. Think about it, if Atl\u00e9tico had won that one, who knows what would have happened at Real Madrid? The whole club could have gone in a totally different direction. Our success since then has been about that never-say-die attitude, those late winners, and the sheer belief the guys have had. Now everyone fights for every ball. Before 2014, it felt like some of our players just kind of accepted losing to European teams. As a Madridista since 2005, I've seen it all. And it's awesome that some of the legends from that 2014 team are still around, showing the young guys how to win those big games.",
