I have some information from some other madrid fan friends I have because they seem more involved, but they seem to know nothing about this. Also, about the tickets, do you know RM itself sells away tickets for ucl nights? Maybe if I can't find home tickets I can find away ones!? thhanks\n",

        "content": "This post will probably be deleted but the truth is I think the board is much more to blame for the shit show than any individual player is and this isn't even me saying this because we lost one or two matches. People going crazy over one or two losses are overreacting but its a valid criticism to say that the way we lost certain matches have been very embarrassing as a supporter of the club. \n\nWhen we won the champions league and league last I don't even think we had the best players individually in the world compared to some other teams but we had a balance like no other. Vini and Rodrygo offered something different to Bellingham and Joselu. Kroos, Valverde and Tchouameni complemented each other and then you could rotate them with Camavinga and modric as needed. We had the ever reliable and professional Nacho and the beast Rudiger in the back Lunin was a positive surprise.\n\nBut the recruitment since that season has been poor and even though I criticized Ancelotti for what I perceived to be a lack of tactics i also realized just how difficult a job he had but still his inability to properly rotate and make early subs probably caused some of our injury issues. \n\nFor example, it took Kroos years of playing the same position to master it, he didn't become the Kroos we know overnight but for some reason we expect Bellingham who has shown he has a knack for getting goals and being a good poacher to suddenly become Kroos.\n\nWhen France won the world cup, there's a reason Giroud was a keypart, he offered a different dimension to the Mbappes and the griezmans but yet we signed Mbappe as a F1 car and expect him to play like a monster truck instead of maybe just signing the monster truck we needed.\n\nWe are asking Tchouameni to play like Kroos when that was never his game, that's like asking Casemiro to turn into modric, they are simply not that type of players but they allow those type of players to flourish.\n\nRamos was also prone to mistakes and stupid red cards early in his career but we expect Dean to become the Ramos we all remember when he was in his prime.\n\n\nBut in saying all this we are still top of the league even with all the flaws in the team and considering we have a manager thats still getting to know the team. Stop blaming individual players and instead blame the board for not properly rebuilding the team with the right players because expecting players to suddenly change their attributes to be a different player is not going to work. Mbappe will never be that type of striker, Valverde or. Bellingham will never be a dictator, Vini will never stop dribbling, Camavinga will never be a winger and Curtois will never be a ball playing keeper. Alonso has to find a way to get the best out of what he has and I trust he will and if we win even the league this year I'll be satisfied with that.",

        "content": "This club has arguably the worst fanbase when it comes to supporting our own players and backing the manager. Just look at other teams that are having a worst season than us, Liverpool literally won the league last season and now they have lost 6 games in a row and are out of the title race and yet I don't hear any slot out, sell this player and sell that player nonsense. \n\nWe only lost two games and drawn one so far this season but the way this fanbase is acting you would think we are in relegation. Everything seems blown out way of proportion and all its doing is feeding into the tabloids/medias hands to create a narrative about how the locker room is in disarray and all those clips in the Rayo game is just proving my point. Just wait until after the international break when we start to win games again how all these \"issues\" just vanish and all the xabi out and player fc hating fans go quiet, it happened after we lost to Atletico Madrid and we bounced back just fine. \n\nlosing to Liverpool in the champions league is not the end of the world as we are still in the top 8, all we need to do is learn from our mistakes and move on. We are so much better than last season, and yet still finding our new identity, its not perfect but we are heading in the right direction.",

        "content": "Both of our last games got a lot to do with the right side attack now working. Especially the Liverpool game.\n\nIn 23-24 Cavajal was on his prime, Valverde did a lot to cover for him.\n\nI think Valverde did well in the Valencia game, but in the Liverpool game he rarely came up. and Jude wasn't on the right side either. Both Diaz and Rodrygo proved they are not good starters on the right.\n\nWith TAA back, we can use Valverde as Right midfielder again, but TAA isn't some typical full back who just run into space and cross, we need to change the system if we want to use him well.\n\nEndrick certainly can bring some good attack since he can run, dribble and charge into the box. It's just he needs to learn more about pass combination/run back to help defense. I do think he deserves more chances compare to Rodrygo on the right.",

        "content": "I\u2019ve been watching the last couple of seasons and the current one closely, and one thing that comes to mind is the inconsistency in our freekick takers. We\u2019ve got decent players in the squad that can take that role permanently \u2014G\u00fcler, Trent, Mastantuono, Rodrygo, Mbappe (if he perfects it and stays consistent).\n\nHistorically, we\u2019ve had legends like Cristiano, Roberto carlos who filled that role when needed. Personally, I think it\u2019s time we settle on one player be a constant threat from set pieces.",

        "content": "Every season this place becomes obsessed with certain players and their lack of playtime. \n\nI've seen users demanding for Brahim to get more playing time in previous seasons. And when he got and gets to start, he doesn't perform. \n\nPeople wanted Rodrygo to play more on the left, he gets to play there some matches and doesn't perform. He hasn't performed for a very long time now. \n\nPeople demanded for Guler to start. He plays well against low blocks but is a liability in the big matches and in matches with high tempo or physical play. \n\nCamavinga is/was talked about like the solution to our issues in the midfield. But he hasn't shown it, he's very inconsistent. More bad performances than good, and he's injured too often. \n\nNow it's Endrick. He's the answer to all the problems according to users here. The fact is that he has shown that he is very raw and has been injured for a while. \n\nIt makes me wonder why this is. Why do the users here think that certain individuals will fix everything? \n\nIs this place filled with very young users? Is it years of the club relying on individuals to win us titles that has lead to this discourse?",
