        "content": "Last week, I traveled with a friend to the CWC. See saw Chelsea vs Esperance, and Real vs. Salzburg.\n\nI have been a Madrid fan since they signed Ronaldo, and have been watching soccer as a die-hard fan of the sport since 2014, and have become probably a super nerd (reading books on tactics, re-watching old games, watching academy games and things) since the 21-22 season.\n\nI have only seen Madrid play once, against AC Milan in a pre-season friendly.\n\nBoth of us from US.\n\nWe both had an amazing time. I know there is a lot of outrage of inhumane temperature, and amount of games being played and sports washing -- and I am on board for all of that. But for less than $100 per ticket, which is a fair exchange for a U.S. sports fan, in example my Dallas Cowboys tickets are always over $200 for a regular season game, it was a good value. I had pretty decent seats too for both games, the Chelsea game was a bit better with being just behind the corner flag, 10-11 rows back for like $75.\n\nThe atmosphere was amazing. The only sporting events I have been that come close is college football. Esperance and Real Madrid fans were passionate, lively, and awesome to talk to. I met fans traveling all over the world, many taking 2-3-4 flights to get to the U.S., and staying for every game.\n\nIt was also dope to see a game in which mattered -- there were scenes after every goal, and loads of passion -- even more than I expected when I bought the tickets.\n\nOverall, it was a 10/10 experience, not thinking about the other variables. And while a lot of people shit on the U.S. for soccer culture, and being undeserving of a tournament like this, or that not a lot of people care, it was dope to have this experience with my friend that ill never forget. They were also so many passionate RM fans there. \n\nSeeing Xabi ball live with 3-5-2, and Tchouameni in that Libero role, and a Gonzalo goal was so amazing. So much pressing and tracking back that was not even captured on the tele cam that I saw in the stadium, but not when I rewatched back.\n\nI really hope we win this thing and I can say I saw a part of our club's history. \n\n  \n",

        "content": "I\u2019ve said it before, but now there\u2019s no excuse. Bastoni is 26, in his prime, and still wasting his best years at Inter. Meanwhile, we\u2019re actually running a 3-5-2 under Xabi Alonso, we just beat Salzburg 3-0 with it.\n\nThis system screams for a left-footed CB who can progress the ball, stay calm under pressure, and cover wide spaces. That\u2019s literally Bastoni\u2019s whole profile. He\u2019s been doing it for years at Inter. He\u2019s tailor-made for this setup.\n\nInstead, we\u2019re rotating Tchouam\u00e9ni at CB (who\u2019s done well tbf), Dean Huijsen (who I really rate, he looks legit), and Rudiger (still solid but visibly declining \u2014 had a rough one vs Salzburg). Militao\u2019s still recovering from back-to-back ACLs, Alaba\u2019s MIA for who knows how long. The depth just isn\u2019t there.\n\nBastoni is just sitting at Inter, defending against bottom-half Serie A sides like it\u2019s a lifetime commitment. This is the moment. He\u2019s in his prime. He fits the system. He\u2019s gettable. What are we waiting for?\n\nFeels like another one of those \u201cReal waited too long\u201d situations brewing. I hope not, but man\u2026\n\nHow much do you think Inter expect for him? ",
