        "title": "Real Madrid, like their Clasico rivals Barcelona, have always been owned by their members, since their foundation in 1902.  Now, alternatives to this model are being explored by president Florentino Perez and his advisors. Outside investment could come in. Fans would no longer be the sole owners.",
        "content": "Real Madrid are stepping up plans towards a radical change in their ownership structure \u2014 one that would allow external investors to purchase stakes in the club for the very first time.\n\nMadrid have been owned by their socios (club members) since being founded in 1902 and any adjustments to that model would require them to approve it in a vote. Only three other clubs have the same structure in Spanish football \u2014 Athletic Club, Osasuna and Barcelona.\n\nMadrid are the only club in world football to have recorded revenues over \u20ac1billion (\u00a3870million; $1.2bn), a total reached over the 2023-24 season according to a Deloitte report (\u20ac1.045.5bn was the exact figure).\n\nDespite this, Madrid\u2019s president, Florentino Perez, has spoken about how being owned by members holds them back in certain ways, especially when competing in the transfer market with rival clubs backed by billionaires or sovereign wealth funds.\n\nPerez, 78, first mentioned the possibility of holding a \u201creferendum\u201d about changes to Madrid\u2019s ownership structure at the club\u2019s annual general assembly last year \u2014 changes that would allow investment from outside partners while still retaining control for the members, although no concrete proposals were shared.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the situation \u2014 who, like all cited here, asked to speak anonymously as they did not have permission to comment \u2014 Madrid\u2019s president is now set to present new details and further plans to move towards these changes at the upcoming general assembly for 2025. No date has been set for the event, but it is expected to be held before the end of November.\n\nOne idea that has already been discussed internally would see Real Madrid being effectively split into two different entities \u2014 separating the football side from the business side. In this way, socios would still technically retain ownership, while investors would be invited to purchase shares in the club\u2019s business operations.\n\nThe so-called 50+1 model, the Bundesliga ownership rule designed to ensure members retain a majority stake in clubs, has also been discussed both inside and outside the Bernabeu.\n\nThe full and final details of what would be a very complex operation for tax and legal reasons are still being worked out, sources said. But there is growing anticipation inside and outside the club that the coming weeks could mark the onset of historic change at the Santiago Bernabeu.\n\nWhat is Madrid\u2019s ownership model?\n\nAll Spanish sports clubs were member-owned until the early 1990s, when the national government mandated that professional teams be converted into a special type of private company called sociedades anonimas deportivas (sporting limited companies).\n\nMadrid were among four clubs given special dispensation to remain as they were \u2014 along with Barcelona, Athletic and Osasuna.\n\nThese four are all very proud of their special status, which involves democratic processes, including members electing the club\u2019s president, approving (or not) annual accounts, and voting on changes to club statutes at assemblies that must be held once a year.\n\nHow does it work? \n\nUnder the current rules, only the children or grandchildren of Madrid socios can apply to become Madrid socios. And just a select number of the club\u2019s 100,000 or so members are allowed to vote at the annual assembly. These are called socios compromisarios (delegate members). They number around 2,000 and are chosen in a vote in which all members can participate.\n\nStill, Madrid\u2019s governance model is integral to the club\u2019s self-image, although few doubt that Perez has been the most influential in setting policy during his two spells as president (2000-2006 and since 2009). Compared to the three other socio-owned clubs in La Liga, Madrid\u2019s assemblies feature very little public dissent. The board\u2019s plans are almost always voted through by a large majority of delegates.\n\nIn 2012, changes to the club\u2019s statutes mandating that any presidential candidate must have been a socio for at least 20 years, and must provide a guarantee of 15 per cent of the club\u2019s annual budget (this was \u20ac1.1bn for 2024-25), were voted through with 997 votes in favour, 100 against, and 15 abstentions.\n\nMore recently, proposals that allowed the club to partner with U.S. investment companies to finance the expensive Bernabeu rebuild were also voted through by compromisarios with similarly large majorities.\n\nWhat external partners do Madrid already have?\n\nThe approximate \u20ac1.8billion cost of the refurbished Bernabeu \u2014 along with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic \u2014 led Madrid to look for outside financial support in recent years.\n\nIn 2017, they agreed a deal with the U.S. private equity group Providence, receiving \u20ac200m in exchange for a share of future sponsorship revenues. In 2021, that deal was renegotiated, with another \u20ac50m provided.\n\nIn May 2022, U.S. investor Sixth Street provided \u20ac360m in funding for the Bernabeu rebuild. That deal saw a 20-year partnership run through a joint venture containing all of Madrid\u2019s in-stadium income, with the exception of season-ticket sales.\n\nStadium management specialist Legends \u2014 in which Sixth Street are majority shareholders \u2014 also partnered with Madrid to run the club\u2019s retail operations and all the Bernabeu\u2019s restaurants and bars. A separate \u2018Bernabeu\u2019 company and brand has also been established to manage all the club\u2019s \u2018non-football\u2019 activities, from Taylor Swift concerts to an NFL game and corporate events.\n\nHow has Perez been preparing the ground for change?\n\nPerez has often argued that his first priority is to protect Madrid\u2019s socio-owned model, and that this motivates his regular battles with La Liga and UEFA, as well as his continued promotion of a European Super League.\n\nBut he has also spoken about how the socio model makes it more difficult to compete with other top European clubs whose owners can more easily inject money directly into their teams.\n\nHe mentioned all the above again at Madrid\u2019s November 2024 assembly, while making what was a surprise announcement of a potential future vote on changes to how the club was governed and owned.\n\n\u201cI confirm to you that we will bring to this assembly a proposal for the club\u2019s corporate reorganisation that clearly secures our future, protects us from the threats we face, and, above all, guarantees that we, the members, are true owners of our club, real and full owners of our economic assets,\u201d Perez said.\n\n\u201cAnd, of course, introducing the necessary elements so that effective control of the club always remains in the hands of its members. It will be all of us members who, in a referendum, will decide our destiny together.\u201d\n\nNot much has been said in public since then by Perez about this referendum, or what the question might be. But the Bernabeu hierarchy are well aware of the value of their club. One source suggested Madrid could be worth as much as \u20ac10billion \u2014 the same as the Dallas Cowboys, the NFL\u2019s most valuable franchise.\n\nWhat might happen now?\n\nMultiple sources have told The Athletic that the Madrid hierarchy, along with close advisors at Key Capital Partners and the law firm Clifford Chance (both of whom played key roles in the failed European Super League), have been discussing possible new ownership models that would allow for external investment while also keeping as much control as possible with the club\u2019s socios.\n\nHowever, it still remains unclear exactly what direction the club will now take.\n\nOne idea is to split Madrid into two entities \u2014 one covering football and the other the club\u2019s business. In this scenario, Madrid would be able to invite investors to buy stakes in their business side (such as TV rights or stadium revenues), while ownership of the club would legally remain in the hands of the socios through its charitable foundation.\n\nBut how this would work in practice, and how it would match up to Spanish corporate and tax law, has proved difficult to finalise. It is also a very sensitive topic and would be controversial among at least some Madrid supporters.\n\nThe option of allowing members to sell their share, perhaps yielding windfalls of somewhere between \u20ac50,000- \u20ac100,000, was discussed internally but has now been taken off the table, sources say.\n\nAnother challenge, this time from a potential investor\u2019s perspective, is that many Bernabeu season tickets currently cost less than the price of most VIP packages for just one game. For an external investor, fewer local socios, and more one-off visitors to the stadium, would be preferable. But those local socios are Perez\u2019s power base, and keeping them happy is a big priority for him.\n\nAlso, sources familiar with Madrid\u2019s internal discussions say that the current hierarchy wants to ensure that decisions such as hiring or firing the coach and player transfers would always be made by the board, which is ultimately answerable to the socios.\n\nA potentially more palatable option for Madrid\u2019s board and socios is something closer to the Bundesliga\u2019s 50+1 rule, in which club members always retain a majority (50 per cent plus one vote) of decision-making power.\n\nBut again, it is not clear how the club\u2019s ownership structure could move towards this without encountering significant complications; for the current leadership, the socios and potential investors. One industry source also suggested that the 49 per cent on offer to external investors in this scenario would be made less appealing by the lack of control it would bring \u2014 meaning it would therefore be badly monetised.\n\nPerez has always been very clear that he does not want a situation where any outsiders could take control of Real Madrid. \u201cNobody should be able to sweet-talk their way into control,\u201d he told socios back in 2012. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to think bad of anyone, not of Arab sheikhs or Russians, but this is our own thing.\u201d\n\nNo matter what new model is chosen, any money raised from investors would go into the club: to strengthen the team, or go towards paying the Bernabeu redevelopment costs.\n\nNobody is going to \u2018cash out\u2019, and Perez himself does not stand to benefit financially. The 78-year-old, who has been attending games at the Bernabeu since the 1950s, is looking for a way to retain control in the short term, while safeguarding the club\u2019s competitiveness at the top level far into the future.\n\nWhatever is decided, some kind of change in Madrid\u2019s club model is coming, and has been in preparation for some time.\n\nHow exactly to find the right balance between different interests involved \u2014 lifelong fans, current directors, future investors \u2014 remains to be seen. The devil could be in the details of whatever final plan is eventually put to socios to vote on.",

For me it was Higuain\u2019s goal vs Osasuna in 2008 that resulted in us winning LaLiga AND making Barca give us a guard of honor in the Cl\u00e1sico.",

        "title": "Ask Me Anything: Demystifying - Florentino Perez is rumored to propose a new ownership structure in the next general assembly of Real Madrid. I have been studying the financial reports of Real Madrid for half a decade, and read every article about this rumor. Ask me any question about it.",
        "content": "Some of my previous work here on the subreddit: https://old.reddit.com/r/realmadrid/comments/1eb16sw/oc_in_depth_overview_and_consequences_of_real/\n\nI have keen interest in financial systems, and have researched extensively on the subject of the new ownership change at Real Madrid.\n\nIt has its pros as well as its cons. Lets start with what is current ownership structure of Real Madrid:\n\n1. Real Madrid is fully owned by its members (socios) - 100% ownership where they pay an annual fee of membership upto a certain age after which it becomes free.\n\n2. Its nearly impossible for anyone to become socio unless they get the membership transferred from their family member (parents, grandparents) to them.\n\n3. Socios vote on the assembly for various resolutions just like it happens in any shareholder meeting of a public listed company.\n\n4. Socios vote every term for a president who takes control of the club and manages its operations.\n\n5. President does not make a single penny for his job and runs the board only for the welfare of the club. They do not own the club. \n\n6. Real Madrid needs to run self sustainably manner because there is nobody to inject capital or do a fund raise if a crisis or catastrophe hits the club (example COVID, when Madrid had to sell players without buying anyone for years)\n\n7. Barcelona have the same exact structure, and runs on the same principles. The only difference is that they have a limit on president running for consecutive terms, as well as the minimum budget that needs to be put as collateral can be shared by all board members.\n\nNew ownership structure proposed:\n\n1. Real Madrid will issue shares and convert the club from 100% ownership to a hypothetical 50+1 structure akin to Bayern Munich.\n\n2. Let this be clear: Real Madrid will still be majority controlled by the socios, there is not a shadow of doubt about it. Everything remains as same as above, only the new difference is the ability to raise capital.\n\n3. Now the club has the option to raise capital by offering upto 49% equity of the company that will be established. \n\n4. Club doesn't needs to offer 49% in one-go, they can opt for something as low as 5% for 500M euros at 10B valuation or simply do not raise any capital at all.\n\n5. In all possibility, this will be the case. Real Madrid will not offer any shares at all. Its just a backup insurance in case a crisis hits the club.\n\n6. If for some reason club does offer shares, all of the proceeds will go directly to the club. No - Perez, JAS, Saudi, Socios, no-one can use the proceeds, only the club can use it for its own needs.\n\n7. If the club comes up with a expansion plan that needs heavy capital with associated risk - only then would Madrid offer its equity and even still at very low amounts.\n\n---\n\nSo in essence,\n\nFlorentino Perez wants to safeguard Real Madrid's financial health for the future. Club has near 0 net debt (most of the 1.1B debt is tied with Bernabeu renovations which is already generating 350M of income and average interest rates are as low as 3% which is less than the inflation rate itself!)\n\nClub has rebuilt a sensational young team and still generates healthy 250M EBITDA each year that can be used for buying new players. There's 0 need of any fresh capital unless club comes up with a huge expansion plan.\n\n---\n\nPros:\n\n1. Real Madrid gains an enormous financial leverage as the club can raise upto 49% of equity which at 10B valuation is close to 4.9B euros if any need arrives in the future.\n\n2. Real Madrid gain huge financial transparency for the future that will stop from a Bartomeu situation to ever occur since the club will have to adhere with stricter financial rules and have to answer to the minority investors if any fresh capital is raised in the future.\n\n3. Each socio gains an actual share to cement their legitimacy and can ask for more transparent financial disclosures again improving the corporate governance of the club.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Real Madrid ceases to be non-profit organisation on the day it raises capital because minority investors will want a financial incentive at the end of the day. If the synergies are well matched that it can overturned practically by leveraging the club's brand for the minority investor's gain. Bayern does this with Adidas, Allianz, Audi partnership.\n\n2. Socios's shares will get diluted everytime there's a fresh capital raise however - Club cannot raise capital without socios's approval and if they do, it will definitely be either to overcome a crisis or a huge expansion plan and in both cases - the shareholder value of socios will rise.\n\n3. There can be a divergence from sporting goals to financial goals if the structure is not setup well and any minority investor of the future is allowed in without proper due diligence.\n\n---\n\nTLDR: Real Madrid will be employing a high risk - high reward planning with this new structure. On hand they gain an enormous financial security and leverage for the future but with great power comes great responsibility.\n\nI welcome the idea but have some cynicism on how the fund raise will happen if ever - My ideal world would be to convert to 50+1 but do not raise any fresh capital and continue running the club as it is with multi-folds higher level of corporate governance and financial transparency in post-Perez world to ensure our next president is as pure to the cause and not there just for corruption or financial rewards.\n\nThe 49% backup equity shall only be touched in a case of extreme crisis to give the club a new chance and even still no more than 5% equity shall ever be diluted in a single round at any point of time.\n\nEverything else runs as it has always been running.\n\n\nNow any questions? Feel free to drop them below and I will try my best to answer it to best of my abilities!",

        "content": "Arda G\u00fcler on joining Real Madrid from Fenerbah\u00e7e  : I knew I was joining the biggest club in the world. But from my very first training session, I realized I had the quality to play here. I never doubted that I would eventually succeed  \n  \nArda G\u00fcler on lack of playing time in the last two seasons : Juni Calafat had explained the plan to me. He told me the first season would be difficult, and that it was logical for a player who had only experienced football in Turkey. He also told me that I was coming in for the post-Modri\u0107 and Kroos era. Everything was clear and honest  and that\u2019s how it should be.  \n  \nArda G\u00fcler on Carlo Ancelotti: \u201cCarlo Ancelotti is one of the greatest coaches in history. We mustn\u2019t forget that he told the press that I would become one of the best midfielders in the world one day. Davide Ancelotti also always tried to help me. I\u2019m grateful. When I wasn't playing, it was difficult, but it fueled my ambition: I was biding my time.''\n\nArda G\u00fcler on winning UCL 2023/24 : \u201cUCL 2023/24? I never won it. It wasn\u2019t mine. We have to go and win a new one.\"\n\nArda G\u00fcler on his chemistry with Mbappe:  \u201cMbapp\u00e9\u2019s qualities and mine are made for each other. We understand each other really well, it\u2019s fluid. Sometimes, we talk a little before matches - *''Today, we should do this, that.* \" There are also nights when a glance is enough.\u201d\n\nArda G\u00fcler on Mbappe leaving his CF spot : \u201cMbapp\u00e9 criticized for dropping too deep sometimes? I think we have to let him play where he wants. He must benefit from the freedom his talent gives him the right for. If he drops into the middle, if he drops back a little, it\u2019s not for nothing. He has the knowledge to do it, he understands what the game demands. When he does that, it\u2019s up to me to go and occupy his place.\u201d\n\n Arda G\u00fcler on comparison with \u00d6zil : \u201cMe &amp; Mbapp\u00e9 compared with \u00d6zil &amp; Cristiano? It\u2019s cool, it\u2019s nice. They\u2019ve done great things. But it\u2019s always the team that goes after the big achievements, never two players.\u201d\n\nArda G\u00fcler on Juni Calafat : \u201cJuni Calafat helped me a lot last year, he explained to me that I need to have patience because of the legends at the club, I understood that, I was a kid coming from Turkey.\u201d\n\nArda G\u00fcler on his relationship with Xabi : \u201cI have full confidence in Xabi Alonso\u2019s plans. If one day he tells me to play goalkeeper, I\u2019ll buy gloves!\u201d\n\nArda G\u00fcler on expectations from him: ''The noise around me \u2014 I\u2019ve never seen it as pressure. It\u2019s something that actually helps me push further. It\u2019s like I need that.''\n\nArda G\u00fcler on the Xabi Alonso era : I\u2019m convinced we\u2019re moving in the right direction. I don\u2019t know exactly how long it will take, but we\u2019ll be ready when the time really comes.",

Entonces al Bar\u00e7a le conviene apoyar a Villar y tener una buena relaci\u00f3n con la federaci\u00f3n, donde se cuecen los comit\u00e9s de \u00e1rbitros, la competici\u00f3n y la Liga\"... \n\nY luego conect\u00f3 su buena relaci\u00f3n con la federaci\u00f3n con lo que \u00e9l denomin\u00f3 un \"saldo arbitral favorable\".\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJOSE MARIA ENRIQUEZ NEGREIRA (HIJO DE NEGREIRA):\n\n\n\n\"El Bar\u00e7a minti\u00f3 en Hacienda para desligarse de mi padre y me us\u00f3 como pretexto\", \"Los 7,5 millones no fueron por los informes, yo cobr\u00e9 60.000 \u20ac\".\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nANASTASIO MAYORAL CEDENILLA (\u00c1RBITRO):\n\n\n\nEn 1985, el \u00e1rbitro de Primera Divisi\u00f3n Anastasio Mayoral Cedenilla denunci\u00f3 que le ofrecieron 1,5 millones de pesetas para favorecer al Bar\u00e7a ante el Lleida en Copa del Rey.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJOSE VICENTE HERNAEZ (PERIODISTA): \n\n\n\n(1994) A\u00f1o siguiente de entrar Enr\u00edquez Negreira en el CTA.\n\nArt\u00edculos de Joe Vicente Hern\u00e1ez despu\u00e9s de un partido Barcelona - Osasuna y Barcelona - Atl\u00e9tico:\n\n\"Al Bar\u00e7a naturalmente, no le hace falta recusar a un arbitro. Basta con que un d\u00eda cualquiera de partido se le insin\u00fae algo a Enr\u00edquez Negreira (miembro del Comit\u00e9 de Designaci\u00f3n) en el palco presidencial del Camp Nou, al que suele ir con relativa frecuencia. O en cualquier partido de su hijo con uno de los equipos inferiores del Bar\u00e7a. En esta Loto futbol\u00edstica le vuelve a tocar el primer premio al mismo. Que casualidad. Al equipo  azul-grana le han regalado ya varios puntos en esta Liga. Curiosamente, desde que el ex colegiado catal\u00e1n Enr\u00edquez Negreira esta en el Comit\u00e9, el Barcelona es el \u00fanico club para el que no existe el problema arbitral\".\n\nJos\u00e9 Vicente Hern\u00e1ez ya lo denunciaba ya en sus art\u00edculos. Al igual que tambi\u00e9n lo hicieron, los presidentes Mendoza y Jes\u00fas Gil.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
