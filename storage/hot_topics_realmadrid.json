Every header, every strike, every sprint tells a story of resilience, of faith, of those who bleed white no matter the odds.\n\nSome of these players were giants in their time, some quiet dreamers who seized the moment. All of them remind us why we love this game, why we love this club.\n\nLife may throw the impossible at us, but if they can see it through to the final whistle, so can we.\n\n// 004 \\[Remontada.
