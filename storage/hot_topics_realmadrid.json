Centre back\n\nSell:\n1. Alaba ( all - time lb for Bayern. Had a good first season with us. But has been injury prone since then. Didn\u2019 t play for us in a while. On high wage. Ageing. We could use a better form centre back rn so he should make space for that.) \n2. One of Mendy or Fran Garcia ( depends on who the next season manager would want more)\n3. Camavinga ( this is a controversial one . He is great 100% but tchouameini will always be above him in the pecking order. If we sell him now we get a big sum for him now that we can balance out with the transfer ins.)\n4. Lucas Vazquez ( he is ageing and can\u2019t be played as rb anymore even if a game asks for a more attacking rb since his defensive attributes are non existent. We could use him back as rw but we have Brahim and have plenty of other attacking options available)",
