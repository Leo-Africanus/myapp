        "content": "I\u2019ve been a regular on this sub for quite a long time, and honestly, over the past year I\u2019ve noticed a real drop in the quality of discussion. I actually find myself avoiding visiting this place lately because of how toxic it\u2019s become (somehow even more than r/soccer, which says a lot). The amount of hate toward certain players, especially Vini, is absurd.\n\nThen there are the so called \u201ctactical analysis\u201d posts popping up daily. Things like \"why Mbappe is better as a LW\", \"why Fede should play as an RW\", etc are low-effort, repetitive, and doesn't offer any real insight.\n\nWhat\u2019s even worse is the atmosphere. The sub now seems entirely driven by player agendas, and anyone who expresses a different opinion gets instantly downvoted into oblivion.  Even though the sub didn't offer very high quality discussions it still used to feel like a space for Madristas. Now it feels like a fan community just with hot takes and echo chambers.\n\nMods, please approve this post**.** I\u2019m not trying to start drama, just sharing honest feedback from someone who\u2019s been here for a long time and really wants this sub to feel enjoyable again.\n\n",

I think that this is a must win game, for the team, for the fans and for Xabi as well. We have Kylian in an amazing form and he is capable of scoring a hat trick once again. Trent and Dani are back and we have stable defence, we must improve, but I think we have capacity to stop their attack. And the bonus thing is that we play at the Bernabeu with +2 points ahead of them.\n\nMy prediction is 4-2 for Madrid, Kyky x3 and Franco x1 goal. \n\nLet me hear you as well?",
