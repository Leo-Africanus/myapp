He can play LB and CM, and he is only 22 years old.\n\nCouple months ago Fabrice Hawkins reported that Nuno Mendes does not want to renew with PSG but he ended up signing a deal till 2029, so if we want to sign him, we have to offer a Glactico free.\n\nRationally, it might probably be Zubamendi. As Xabi shows alot of intrest in him but I feel Tchou and Zubi share a similar role and Tchou has been immense in 2025. So I am 50/50 on that signing and favor stiller as he is a different type of player similar to Kroos. \n\n  \n\n\n",

        "content": "Vey very happy to see this!! In recent years, I have seen lots of attacks by our fanbase on Ra\u00f9l.. He is the OG prince of Madrid! And despite him being one of the best coaches in Castilla history, the amount of slander from people who have never watched Castilla.. He\u2019s a true Madridista and deserves nothing but love.. Fought for the team in one of the toughest periods of our history.. Gracias Ra\u00f9l \ud83e\udd0d",
