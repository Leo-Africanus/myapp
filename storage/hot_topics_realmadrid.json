        "content": "My friend and I are planning on visiting Madrid for the first time in Jan 31st to Feb 8th. We were looking into getting tickets for Matchday 22. They play Rayo Vallecano that weekend. However, the date I saw was listed as Feb 1st on OneFootball and some other sites. But on the Madrid ticket site it\u2019s on Jan 31st. Does anyone know where to find the actual date they\u2019ll be playing? I\u2019m really hoping it\u2019s on the February 1st\n\nAlso any advice on buying tickets too would be appreciated!",

        "content": "as everyone knows, barca is playing an away game against villareal (currently 3rd in the table) at miami, instead of la ceramica - arguably one of the toughest atmospheres in spain. we all know which team the crowd will support in miami, thereby giving barca an unfair advantage by having to play one less game. we moght not be able to do much but we can at least try to raise a voice against this practice that ruins the entire format of a league type competition. we must protest against this in all football subreddits as well as other social media.
