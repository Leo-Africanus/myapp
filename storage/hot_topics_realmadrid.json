        "content": "Full transcript: \n\nCristiano Ronaldo: \n\u201cAt Real Madrid, for example, I remember when I missed a chance or a penalty I would be so angry with myself. I didn't allow myself to make mistakes. I would go to bed without dinner, and talk to myself, wondering why I shot to the right or to the left. I don't regret being like that.\n\nEverything that happens on the field, stays on the field. I can't get home with my football problems with my family. But at first it was very difficult. I missed an opportunity or penalty and I locked myself in my room and talked to myself. I was sick.\n\nMbapp\u00e9 is fast, powerful, he has speed\u2026 He can\u2019t wait in the box. He has to stay out and appear. If I did it, can\u2019t Mbapp\u00e9 do it? Real Madrid have to protect him.\n\nVin\u00edcius should have won the Ballon d'Or, but I'm not surprised, there is no credibility, I was very disappointed, he deserved it.\n\nJude Bellingham reminds me a lot of Zidane, he has some Zidane elements. He will give a lot to Madrid, because he will be a star.\n\nI like the fact that Real Madrid fans miss me. My home is Spain, I played for Madrid for many years, it was where I was happiest. Real Madrid was always in my heart.\n\nMy son Mateo really likes Bellingham, Camavinga, Mbapp\u00e9.\n\nI achieved beautiful things at Madrid and people don\u2019t forget that, that makes me happy.\n\nI respect Perez, he is a trustworthy president and a serious person, and he treated me well. We won many titles with him, and I respect him a lot.\n\nI loved playing in the Camp Nou. They booed me, they insulted me, and I LOVED that.\n\nYou may prefer Pele, Messi, Maradona, I understand and respect that.\n\nI have a very good relationship with Messi, I was his translator at some awards ceremonies.\n\nAt one point I was at Sporting and I managed to go to Barcelona, \u200b\u200bthey wanted to sign me.\u201d\n\nIt didn't happen, because they wanted to sign me the following year and United came and signed me.\n\nI enjoyed scoring goals more at the Camp Nou than at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u. When you are warming up and they are already whistling at you, that\u2019s what I love. That\u2019s the best part of football for me.\u201d\n\nMadrid - Barcelona atmosphere and the relationship with Messi?\n\nCristiano Ronaldo:\n\n\u201cIt was a historic rivalry, Madrid-Barcelona, \u200b\u200bCristiano-Messi, Ramos-Pique.\n\nIt was very nice I had a very good relationship with Messi and I once translated it into some awards and all that before the ceremony started He has always treated me well and I hope we see our numbers again, but I find it very difficult\u201d\n\n\u201cI appreciate and respect Florentino, I speak to him sometimes and I don't rule out coming back one day when I finish my career and do something great.\u201d\n\n\u201cI left Real Madrid because I wanted a new chapter.\n\nIn the negotiations phase when I was leaving Real Madrid, Florentino did not behave well with me. I understood that, because that is always his style.\n\nI told Perez about it, he accepted, but later he tried to come back, and there was no going back for me, because I had given my word to Juventus.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm happy people still remember that I did important and beautiful things and that's why people don't forget when you leave a mark.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpain is my homeland, my children were born there, and I will always have Real Madrid in my heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really like Carlo Ancelotti, he is an amazing person, we have won a lot of things together.\u201d\n",

This is the first time I see the club doing something like this. The board must be furious after these decisions, it's not the first time the VAR is pretending to be asleep.. not only they turn blind eyes on these fouls, but the 2 times Mbapp\u00e9 was on side, yet the VAR checked only the frame AFTER the ball was passed and Mbapp\u00e9 is offside.. and this right here could have easily ended Mbapp\u00e9's career. the tackle was horrible ! \n\nWhat are your thoughts on the club posting this ?

        "content": "In the past 5 seasons Real Madrid hasn't purchased or signed new players as much as they used to in the last 2 decades, recently it was mostly loan returns or buy-back options or signing free players.\n\nfor example during 2010-2011 Winter market we brought Adebayor on loan despite having both Benzema and Higuain who were physically fine. and on 2008-2009 season Van nistelrooy, de la red, and Diarra missed out the remainder of the season due to injuries and the management brought replacements (Huntelaar, Lassana, Parejo, and Faubert) even though they weren't useful.\n\nbut now we don't have Carvajal and Militao for the remainder of this season and our management don't want to sign any new players even temporarily as loans.\n\nReal Madrid is entitled to have 25 players registered in the first team, but we have 22 now with shirt numbers 12,24,and 25 available. or maybe i should say 21 as Vallejo is a bench warmer and never used not even in easier copa games.\n\nso what are the reasons? is it money? is it greed of players and their agents? is it Ancelotti? is it Perez?",

He\u2019s a passionate Madridista, but doesn\u2019t speak Spanish, though his English is mid-level. Although, football is a universal language so I think he can have fun.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re also considering making a vacation out of it.

        "title": "What are the signings you want next season??",
        "content": "This season so far has been mixed bags and while we have individually top players, we also lack balance in the team. \n\nFor example there's no cohesion in midfield and we lack a playmaker who can connect the team, play in pocket spaces and break lines with through balls.\n\nWe have average at best fullbacks and have an ageing defence as well as Militao who might not get back to previous level with back to back ACLs.\n\nThese are the signings I would go for if it was up to me.\n\n1. Wirtz - Xabi might become our next coach and who's the better option to be playmaker than his best player. Wirtz is arguably the best playmaker in the game right now and can bring much needed creativity to our midfield.\n\n2. TAA - Wish Hakimi was playing anywhere but PSG or James wasn't made of glasses. Trent is extraordinary with ball and although he isn't good defensively, he can give different dimension to our attack and spark some thing in often dead right sided attack.\n\n3. Huijsen - Everytime I watch him, he keeps impressing. Tall, young and ball playing defender who's Spanish on top of it. He can be the future of our defence.\n\n4. Miguel - With Davies most likely renewal at Bayern, our options are slim and need to spend more money elsewhere. Miguel can be cost effective yet a very good option.\n\nOnes to keep an eye on.\n1. Murillo - Has been a beast for Nottingham and with recent renewal, move is unlikely. He has potential to play for Madrid in coming years.\n\n2. Nico Paz - One of our own and has been very good for Como. Another season in serie A can do him well at this time though.\n\n3. Angelo Stiller - There's lack of quality deep lying playmakers among the youngsters right now. Stiller is one to look for among the few options out there and I won't be surprised if any big team moves for him soon.",
