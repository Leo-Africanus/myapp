Gonz\u00e1lez Fuertes announces stricter measures and actions in the coming weeks regarding the RMTV video and all that is happening, while he wants a \"healthier\" football in general.\n\nWith a question from the press (who are the culprit of the other 50% of this corrupt circus) that goes directly to make controversy (\"Do you think these videos make children not want to be referees in the future?\") De Burgos Bengoetxea takes the word and answers \"Yeah the RMTV videos have repercussion and some other referee colleagues told me: \"Some of their kids go to school and return crying because other kids said \"your father is a thief\" and then starts crying, while says he's honest and wants to teach to their children that.\n\n\\- The show has been made, some crocodile tears there, some threats from the CTA here, so expect tomorrow one of the most awful matches you've seen in football (if you didn't have enough this year like the Osasuna one).\n\n\\- De Burgos Bengoetxea has 64% win rate with Real Madrid. 81% with Barcelona.\n\n\\- Remember that Iturralde Gonz\u00e1lez (referee with most appearances in LaLiga history) said that on a video (I subbed it on English) said this about the CTA decision to put Pablo and De Burgos: [https://streamable.com/idho4y](https://streamable.com/idho4y)\n\n\\- Remember the comparison from UEFA vs Spanish CTA referees:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mziog6ewnzwe1.png?width=502&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec0e432655dcffdc305fdb6b5e09502ef4773531\n\nSo that's it, that's LaLiga Negreira for you. A show of comedy, demagogy, prevarication, corruption and rigged matches.\n\nWe should not go out tomorrow and put Castilla for the remaining LaLiga matches, but of course we don't have enough balls to do that.\n\nOf course this sub will downvote this thread a lot and say that RMTV are clowns for doing that, but of course you're international fans and don't understand what is really happening here. You only keep the surface of things, and can't be analytical for anything as shown in other threads, lol.\n\nIt's like you only watch the tv shows and documentaries out there and believe everything is real, like Drive to Survive of Formula 1.\n\ntl;dr this happened today\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xgfnzwsu50xe1.png?width=1214&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e05b0e0fd893d1814c14df01e84b1614d75873d\n\nEdit: and please, don't believe the press as they turn everything to \"El Madrid\" or \"Madrid is wrong\" and with super dramatic headers.

        "content": "Let's face it, the season hasn't been good for us, but now there's a chance that it could be a complete disaster: trophyless for us and a domestic double or even a full treble for our main rivals. \n\nThe league isn't done by any means, but it isn't in our hands. Even if we win the away Clasico, we'll still need Barcelona to drop points somewhere. They're facing:\n\n1. Real Valladolid (A), by far the worst team in the league, 99% win for Barcelona (they won 7-0 the home game)\n2. Clasico (H)\n3. Espanyol (A)\n4. Villareal (H), Barcelona have 4 wins on their last 5 meetings\n5. Athletic Club (A), immidiately after a potential UEL final for Bilbao, not ideal for dropping points.\n\nI'd say our best bet at them dropping points is the away game against currently 13rd Espanyol, who will also have historical reasons to perform well. But that's IF we win the league Clasico.\n\nThe UCL is far from being decided, but Inter haven't been convincing at all lately. No disrespect to them, but they were eliminated in the Italian Cup semi-finals by... Jovic scoring a brace. And if Barcelona makes the final, they'll face either Arsenal or PSG, teams that have never won the competition before, so the pressure will be much higher (although PSG current squad are more experienced in the competition). \n\nI'm not saying they will win both of those titles, especially the UCL. We've seen everything in football. They could do a 2002 Leverkusen and not win anything in the end. But right now it's up to us to stop them in the final. Also losing the CdR = losing morale = bigger chance to drop points in the league.\n\nHope Ancelotti starts the best possible line-up and the players finally start running and chasing like crazy tomorrow.\n\n",

I was wondering if there would be a good place to watch it, I know as it being el Classico almost everyone will be watching it, but I was hoping to watch it and get as close to an authentic viewing experience that I can. Any good recommendations for fun football bars that will have a fun atmosphere??\n\nSecondly, even thought I\u2019m not a Real Madrid fan I would still love to visit the bernebeu and experience such a historical place. I know there are tours available, but I see that there is construction going on. Does that significantly hamper on the experience? I\u2019m excited to do the tour and see the museum as well. Any recommendations to get the true experience?\n\nThank you all in advance, and if it\u2019s any help I absolutely despise Barcelona so I\u2019ll be rooting for Real Madrid this final!!!!",

Honestly, there's not much we can do directly except **win every remaining match** \u2014 and even then, the title still depends on *Barcelona dropping points*.\n\nSo yesterday was Matchday 33, where both Real Madrid &amp; Barcelona won. So the current point table is like this, and the point gap is **4**\n\n* Barcelona - 76\n* Real Madrid - 72\n\nSo in the league, there are 5 matchdays left this season, with one El Cl\u00e1sico. There are many possibilities, but I'll go through the most likely (or our best-case scenario) ones.\n\n**1. We win all 5, including El Cl\u00e1sico | Bar\u00e7a wins 4 (losing El Cl\u00e1sico)**\n\n* Barcelona - 76 + 12 = 88 pts\n* Real Madrid - 72 + 15 = 87 pts\n* \ud83d\udd34 We will lose the title by just one point.\n\n**2. We win all 5 | Bar\u00e7a wins 3 (incl. losing El Cl\u00e1sico)**\n\n* Barcelona needs to lose both El Cl\u00e1sico and one more match.\n* Barcelona - 76 + 9 = 85 pts\n* Real Madrid - 72 + 15 = 87 pts\n* \ud83d\udfe2 We will win the title by two points\n\n**3. We win all 5 | Bar\u00e7a gets 3W + 1D + 1L (losing El Cl\u00e1sico)**\n\n* Barcelona - 76 + 10 = 86 pts\n* Real Madrid - 72 + 15 = 87 pts\n* \ud83d\udfe2 We will win the title by just one point\n\n**4. We win 4/5 | Bar\u00e7a wins 4/5 | El Cl\u00e1sico draw**\n\n* Barcelona - 76 + 13 = 89 pts\n* Real Madrid - 72 + 13 = 85 pts\n* \ud83d\udd34 We will lose the title by 4 points\n\n# TL;DR\n\nThere will be lots more cases, but in my opinion, these are the best chances we've got. So here are some insights in my POV (just my thoughts)\n\n* With the current situation, the only thing we can do is win all the next 5 matches (including El Cl\u00e1sico somehow) and pray to some other team to defeat Barca.\n* If we lose the El Cl\u00e1sico, the title is gone 99% because I can't see any Barcelona defeats in the next matchdays with their current pace.\n* Even if we somehow managed to win or draw El Cl\u00e1sico, the title still relies on Bar\u00e7a dropping points.\n\nYeah, that's it. Our chances are pretty low but not zero. If we keep managing to win the CdR final, it will boost the title race, I think. So either we win both CDR and LaLiga or...\n\nPlease mention if any details above are wrong or mistaken by me.\n\n**\u00a1Hala Madrid!** \ud83e\udd0d",

Give me your UCL winning tactical genius approach your would use.\n\nOnly rule is: Only use current squad.\n\nOther people can chip in and discuss your ideas and vote for the funniest, best, and overall most interesting ideas.\n\nTHIS IS NOT A SERIOUS POST. WE ARE JUST FANS. NONE OF US ARE QUALIFIED TO TOUCH THE GRASS. PLEASE DONT BE SERIOUS.\n\n  \n\\-----------\n\nMy Real Madrid GEGENPRESS football. 90 min press with super high defense line that relies on offside traps and physicality to harass forwards.\n\nLineup is 3-4-3 -&gt; 3-3-1-2-1 in possession : [https://imgur.com/a/njaWOAO](https://imgur.com/a/njaWOAO)\n\nAscensio and Rudiger as Wide Center Backs with Tchouameni in the middle organizing the whole line and playing the ball to midfielders in the build up.\n\nValverde and Camavinga as wide midfielders, defensively they support the backline and press the opposition wingers/wingbacks. Offensively they present passing options in wider spaces and cover some of the central spaces forward as more players move into the box. They can also play more centered and form the midfield trio with Guler while Rodrygo and Vinicius play more wider roles.\n\nGuler and Bellingham are my main engines in the midfield. Guler is the creative outlet and Bellingham is the work horse. Guler will hold the ball more often and link with the wide midfielders for options forming a midfield trio (Cama, Fede, Guler) while looking to unlock the defense with killer balls to the final thirds. Jude will move forward with and without the ball and form a trio with Rodrygo and Vinicius. He will be a Muller-esk Ramdeuter.\n\nVinicius and Rodrygo are the central forwards. Flexible in positioning and expected to play close together with Jude. Synergy is needed for one-two passes that unlocks any deep defense. But they are also expected to dribble and shoot as much as possible. Expected to press hard when out of possession.\n\nMbappe will have to turn into a Poacher. His job is to lock defenders with him and finish any half chances we get. The team pressing high and crowding the edge of the area will allow lots of balls inside the box. Kylian is expected to pick them up. Expected to press hard when out of possession.\n\n  \nPlaystyle will be a high intensity passing with players generally being close to eachother. Beating defense with dribbling and one-two link ups. NO FUCKING CROSSES.\n\n  \nHow many goals do you think we will concede?\n\nHow many injuries per season?",

        "content": "And yes, I've watched Casillas in his prime years between 2007 and 2012. I've watched Keylor Navas and even Diego Lopez that I actually loved. I think we've always been lucky when it comes to goalkeepers. Even Lunin was brilliant for us last season.\n\nBut honestly I've never felt safe with any other GK like I feel these years with Courtois. Except for his first season, I think Courtois has been the most consistent keeper for us. Casillas, with all respect, used to have some obvious flaws, like dealing with aerial balls and crosses (he was very poor with his feet as well). Navas was a bit inconsistent comparing to Casillas (in his prime) and Courtois, but I have massive respect for him too.\n\nCourtois is just perfect in every possible way.. his 2021/22 season might be the best that I've ever seen for a GK, especially in Champions League. His performance against Liverpool in the final is unmatched, in my opinion. \n\nHe will never play over 700 games for us like Casillas, and he might not end up being the RM keeper with most titles. But in my opinion, he's the best that I've ever seen.. and in my Top 3 GKs of all times (with Buffon + Neuer). I hope he still has 3 or 4 more years in him, because replacing him will be hard.",
