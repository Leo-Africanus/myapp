Comeback after comeback... it felt like every single round was a movie script that no one would have dared to write because it seemed too unbelievable!\n\nFrom PSG to Chelsea, then that crazy City game, and finally lifting la Decimocuarta against Liverpool, each step felt like climbing a mountain. But our players... they left EVERYTHING on that pitch. They played with a spirit that was just unmatched.\n\nThere were moments where it felt like it was over, done. But this is Real Madrid, and somehow, some way, our boys found that extra gear, that bit of magic, to turn the impossible into reality. The Bernab\u00e9u was a cauldron, a true force of nature pushing the team forward.\n\nThat run wasn't just about winning; it was about the heart, the passion, the never-say-die attitude that defines our club. It\u2019s a reminder of what\u2019s possible when you wear that white shirt and fight until the very last second.\n\nEven now, years later, whenever I think about that incredible journey, it fills me with so much joy and a sense of limitless possibility for Real Madrid. What a team, what a spirit, what a run!",

        "content": "99.9% of everyone had written Chelsea off in the final. But if anything has become clear, its that the modern game, for better or worse, requires pressing and physicallity. \n\nLook at what Chelsea did. They pressed from minute 1, the commentators were questioning if they'd run out of gas before 20 minutes and they kept on pressing. \n\nIt worked wonders. PSG, who is the best tiki taki team right now, couldnt even get a pass together. The CBs, MFs and fowards were immeadeatly stifled. They looked like PSG made Madrid look in the previous match.  It shut PSG down completely. They immediately started going to the long ball with no success.  \n\nAnd it paid off. They ran ruckus on the CB/wing backs, thanks also to Sanchez's superb passing and scored on quick turnovers in dangerous positions. They made PSG seem completely normal, average.\n\nWhile watching it, I said, thats completely the opposite of Mbappe and Vini, who barely press. The better or worse part is though, I dont like it. This isnt basketball, this is football. I miss real wings, real number 10s, beatiful dribbling and amazing passes, but alas 2025, and the press rules. If our forwards don't do it, this generation will be wasted.\n\nThis is not a drama post, or sell this player or that player. I've been watching madrid for 30 years. Its been success after success. But, the game has changed and this team has to change with it. \n\nMarca or As was quick to write a story about how Xabi will have complete authority to play or bench whomever. That's complete BS, and everyone knows it. \n\nLuis Enrique was right. (paraphrasing) \"Attacking, you're the best, but when you're not attackeing, you're the best defender in the world, thats what a leader does.\" If Xabi can't put them in line I sure hope Dani and Fede do.

Majority of football fans probably did not know how much talented these players are 2 years ago, they were able to show their worth this season. \n\nHuijsen is a master at carrying the ball, either with his pinpoint passes or with his feet. So is Carreras. \n\n[Among all fullbacks in his league](https://x.com/DataMB_/status/1943720247891997042), he has the most touches, most progressive actions, most passes completed, most forward passes completed, Most progressive passes completed, most accurate passes to final third...etc. Benfica literally played through him. \n\nI don't have this year's stats but last year he dwarfed everyone in his age bracket in [progressive actions](https://x.com/DataMB_/status/1840701634726216192) in the top 7 league. \n\nOn top of all of this, he has experience playing as a CB aswell, we could see him as an LCB in some games too. I can see him transition to a CB like Ramos too.\n\nWe should be very optimistic in regards to our backline, we have a master passer in trent on our RB, A master progressive player in Alvaro on the left and Dean in the middle.

        "content": "Hey everyone,\nIt really feels like we\u2019re finally building a complete squad: two quality players for almost every position, actual investment, and long-term planning.\n\nBut looking back\u2026 why didn\u2019t Ancelotti get this?\n\nI have nothing but respect for Carlo because the man delivered everything. And back then, every headline was, \u201cReal Madrid believe there are no players on the market with Real Madrid quality.\u201d\nWe were told over and over that there was no value, that Madrid wouldn\u2019t spend just to spend. Most of Carlo\u2019s reinforcements were free signings or very opportunistic deals.\n\nBut now under Alonso, we\u2019re actually spending. There\u2019s serious investment and a plan to finally have depth in every line.\n\nSo what changed?\n\t\u2022\tDid Ancelotti not push for signings?\n\t\u2022\tWas P\u00e9rez saving funds for the stadium and Mbapp\u00e9 saga?\n\t\u2022\tOr was Carlo just seen as a transitional figure, and this new \u201ccycle\u201d was always meant for the next manager?\n\nFeels a bit unfair in hindsight, considering what Ancelotti achieved with what he had. Curious to hear what you all think \u2014 is it timing, strategy, or just a change in mindset from the club?\n\nHala Madrid \u26aa\ud83d\udc51\n",

        "content": "As someone that has been supporting madrid for a long time, before the days of Ronaldo when Robinho, Drenthe, Diarra and them were in the team, and someone that has seen some truly awful madrid squads (not saying I know every single thing about madrid), one thing I always found funny is when my friends most who support teams based in England, call me a glory hunter when ironically enough I started supporting madrid during the worst periods.\n\nIts funny though because Raul was my idol even though stature wise I was closer to Drogba at 6,3 220+ pounds but I never played like that. The whole point of this is to say that from what I've seen in this sub with the way people overact to every defeat and turn on players when they are going through a rough patch, regardless of how high of an expectation we have as a club, it clearly shows that there are plenty in this sub that would literally stop supporting the club if we ever somehow become really shit.\n\nAnd as much we might not think its possible, truth is shit happens in football and times change and we could get a president after Perez that mismanages the club and then what. If half the sub loses their mind because we don't even win a preseason tournament after getting a new manager, new players and playing a new system and start losing their minds after 5 games, how will they ever handle coming 12th.",

Pressing like a demon, running constantly, combining the Valverde effort with the Mbappe talent.",

        "content": "All the bad things happened around this game: Red card/sudden injury, if Xabi had taken control for a while he would have a plan B but it only has been 3 weeks. Valverde had to go back to RB, Camavinga. The Early mistake also ruined the game and our morale.\n\nSo I don't think it should be used to judge our squad, our players' quality, and it's not wise to buy 2-3+ players simply because of this game.\n\n\nBut yeah we need to learn from it. The whole team need to know how to press and form a balanced midfield. The 3 forward combination was terrible. \n\nI don't think Vini and Mbappe's main problem is their attitude, but they need to know how to press, how to do their job under Alonso. Especially Vini actually has very high workload but he needs to be given more instruction.",
