But my believe is, to be successful in the long run an to win titles, the attack needs to be complementary - and the three are simply not.\n\nLet\u2019s face it: In their core they are all LW and in particular Vini &amp; Mbapp\u00e9s strenghts (and weaknesses) are too similar. In contrast (and I hate to say that) look at Barcas Raphina, Lewa &amp; LY, how they fit perfectly together and tick all the boxes an attack has to from my point of view.\n\nThe ugly truth in my opinion is: Unfortunately one of them has to go. I have an unpopular opinion who  that should be, but what do you think: Will we win titles with the three? ",

        "title": "There seems to be a prevailing opinion blaming Alaba for yesterday's defeat",
        "content": "I disagree with that. While Alaba wasn't exemplary, I don't think he did that bad &amp; I believe the blame should be directed towards others.\n\nAlaba wasn't bad yesterday except for the foul on Saka that resulted in a goal from the free kick.\nHe kept Saka under control, and the only time Saka went through the defense was when Alaba went over to mark Odegaard and left Saka to bellingham. Saka went through bellingham easily and Alaba tried to sprint back. Luckily, Saka just crossed the ball, and it resulted in nothing.\n\nNow, let's talk about Alaba's tackle on Saka that resulted in the goal:\nThis tackle was made far from Alaba's position. He had to cover for the fact that certain midfielders were not doing much defensive duty (Camavinga in particular). Camavinga made a tackle in this similar position in Saka later in the match, and what do you know? He almost got red carded &amp; resulted in the 2nd goal for Declan.\n\nThe third goal was also the result of shambolic defensive midfield performance. There was far too free space for the opponents, and I don't know what to say about it. But you can see what I'm getting at.\n\n\nNow to the other question:\nWhy was the midfield easily overrun against Arsenal? I believe the answer is:\n\n1. They were outnumbered because our front line failed to fall back and support them, particularly in the 2nd half.\n2. Modric doesn't have the lungs anymore, and Valverde wasn't in the midfield to compensate for that.\n3. Camavinga is tactically illiterate and has zero sense of where to position himself. This is why he's been so bad this season. The man failed to improve since his first season. In fact, I think there's a good case for saying that he has regressed.\n4. Bellingham's workrate seems to have been worsening game after game. Particularly since January.\n\nThis is why Ceballos was so effective when played and manage to help this midfield immensely.\nHe has better tactical sense &amp; decision making, better passing range, and at least a similar workrate to Camavinga. We need Ceballos in that midfield.\n\nI do not understand how a coach like ancelotti, who went through something similar to this in 2014/2015, doesn't see this.",

        "content": "I understand this season he has been bad but why are people in the subreddit acting as if Cama has never played good for Real Madrid ? This is Cama first bad season for Madrid. Have you guys forgotten the player he is? It as if you guys have never seen him play. Some of you saying he has only had one good season is crazy some of you saying he hasn\u2019t improved is crazy. This is his first bad season but if you want him to leave the team you are not a Madrid fan. This guy at his best is capable of being a top 5 midfielder in the world he has been a huge part of our comeback in 2022 and a huge part of the success we had last year. I would argue this guy hasn\u2019t even been able to reach his potential because our manager consistently benches him even after good performances and this was last year and he consistently plays him out of position. I agree Cama deserves critism for this season because he has been disappointing regardless of injuries. but let\u2019s not start acting as if he has shown nothing or done nothing to help this team. True Madrid fans know what this guy is capable of and we are all waiting for him to find that confidence back and find his form",

        "content": "Mendy is a player that gets a lot of criticism simply because he's not Marcelo. That's literally the biggest reason all the plastic fans don't like him, because he doesn't have flair like Marcelo or dribble like Marcelo but you know one thing he does better than Marcelo, that's defend which is something he is greatly under appreciated for considering this is a team without Casemiro so he usually on most occasions has to defend in a 1 v 1 against some of the best wingers in the world but he gets beat once than\nIf Mendy has been playing yesterday or even Fran, Saka has a much more quiet night than he did and yes even though I don't think Fran is as good as Mendy defensively, even though he's better offensively, he would have have still done much better than Alaba. This also goes to show how important Tchouameni is because even though Camavinga has lots of energy and is quicker, his positional awareness is nowhere near Tchouameni which would have been crucial in that midfield battle. Modric should never have started.\n\nI just hope players like Mendy and Tchouameni and even Fran can take their game to the next level if we eventually do get a manager that will help them develop their game beyound their own natural ability the way Klopp did for a lot of the youths that came through the Liverpool academy of Flicki for Raphina",

Maybe it's not enough anymore\u2014but hearing fans talk about him like he's the most useless piece of trash is just heartbreaking. Some people are truly ungrateful, entitled, lowlifes, and it's sad to see.\n\nAnd the irony is, for most of them if they saw him in real life, they'd be begging him for a selfie just so they could show it off to their friends and feel better about their lives.\n\nShow some dignity and grace. If you're upset because your friends are trolling you, grow up already. Did you really think you were going to win everything for the rest of your life? You're watching sports\u2014sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. Most people learn that by the age of five.\n\nI think the man is doing his best. And if his best is no longer enough, we part ways respectfully. There's no need to insult him",
