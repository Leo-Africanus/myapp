        "content": " I\u2019ve been following Real Madrid for almost 20 years, and these divas who think they\u2019re superstars should thank Florentino P\u00e9rez every single morning for banning the Ultras Sur.\nI\u2019ve seen Casillas get booed for poor performances. I saw Mourinho bench him, and he left like any other player. I saw Kak\u00e1 a legend at Milan sit on the bench quietly, without drama or public complaints.\n\nI watched Cristiano Ronaldo, \u00d6zil, Sergio Ramos, Xabi Alonso, Di Mar\u00eda, Benzema give everything for this club. I saw Benzema benched for Higua\u00edn. I saw Marcelo lose his place. I saw Gareth Bale lose his place. And you know what? None of them gave interviews attacking the coach. None of them acted bigger than the club.\n\n\nI\u2019m not talking only about Vin\u00edcius Jr, no no, I\u2019m talking about all those players who step into the pitch just to show off, constantly demanding privileges and questioning the coach publicly.\nI\u2019m not here to defend Xabi Alonso, Ancelotti, or anyone else. I\u2019m here for the club. For REAL MADRID.\n\nThis is not Ibiza Beach FC. This is Real Madrid. Even when we lost, rivals respected us because of who we were. I remember when the Bernab\u00e9u erupted just by seeing the players walk onto the pitch because they transmitted hunger, intensity, and pride.\nNow we\u2019re forced to watch players with egos bigger than Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s, but with the level of Lucas V\u00e1zquez with all due respect to him. These players don\u2019t feel what we feel.\n\nAfter a bad match, they board planes, return to their mansions, sleep with supermodels, and wake up worried only about which Lamborghini, BMW, or Ferrari to drive to training. They want to win without running, without fighting, because they believe they\u2019re untouchable.\nThey don\u2019t respect the fans.\n\nAnd here\u2019s a message for those who started \u201csupporting\u201d Real Madrid in 2018, 2019, or especially in 2022: this club did not start with Valverde, Vin\u00edcius, Courtois, Hazard, or anyone else.\nStop blindly defending players at all costs. Cristiano Ronaldo left this club for much less, after giving us years of joy and historic performances and even he didn\u2019t get special treatment on the way out.\n\nDo you honestly believe anyone in this current squad has done even 30% of what CR7, Marcelo, Ramos, or Benzema did? Of course not.\nSo stop defending laziness. At Real Madrid, effort is non-negotiable. Some players deserve to be booed loudly until they understand the weight of this shirt and some need to be booed to the point of asking to be substituted.\nThis is REAL MADRID.\n\nI have much more to say, but that\u2019s for another time.\nThank you to everyone who read this far.",

        "title": "Been following Real Madrid for 30 years, and this meltdown is wild",
        "content": "Been following this team for 30 years and honestly I have never seen a meltdown like this. Its kind of amazing to watch. Feels like a mix of gold-diggers and fans who only started following Real Madrid because of a certain player. They have no idea what a real rough patch feels like.\n\nLet me tell you something, what we are seeing now is nothing compared to what real fans have gone through.\n\nThink early 2000s. Galacticos everywhere. Figo, Zidane, Ronaldo, Beckham. Everyone expected trophies every season. And yet we had some brutal heartbreaks. Losing the 2002 Champions League semi-final on penalties to Bayern. 2003 La Liga slipping at the worst possible moment. 2005 losing the Champions League quarter-final to Juventus after dominating the league. Fans endured it. We survived it.\n\nMid to late 2000s. The round of 16 curse in the Champions League became a nightmare. Year after year we got knocked out early by Lyon, Roma, Bayern, Liverpool. Champions League expectations were sky-high, but the team kept hitting the wall. La Liga wasnt easy either. We dominated most of the season only to have Barcelona snatch it at the end multiple times. Fans went through heartbreaks, outrage, and frustration. We learned patience the hard way.\n\nEven the first few years after the Galacticos era were rough. Coaching changes every season, big-money signings failing to deliver, rival clubs laughing at us. Every setback felt personal. And still, the true Madridistas stuck with the team.\n\nThen 2013-14. Finally, after years of suffering through that round of 16 curse, we lifted La Decima. Pure relief, pure joy. Everything before that heartbreak suddenly made sense. That\u2019s what it feels like to survive the tough times.\n\nNow, I see a lot of people calling for Perez to resign. Really? Look at where Real Madrid was before him and where he took the club. Do not forget what he has achieved. The man built one of the greatest clubs in the world over and over. La Decima, La Undecima, multiple Champions Leagues, dominating Europe for decades. Criticize all you want, but calling for him to leave in a rough patch shows how little some people know or remember what this club went through before he arrived.\n\nAnd another thing. Stop comparing Real Madrid to Manchester United. Like really? Are you joking? Look at the last decade. United have struggled in PL and Champions League. Real Madrid have won 5 Champions Leagues in 9 years under Zidane and beyond. Winning La Liga, dominate in Europe. Revenue? Brand? Squad depth? History? Real Madrid is in a different league. You cannot compare the two, and anyone saying otherwise clearly does not understand football.\n\nSo yes, the situation is messy. Fans are upset. But relax, this chaos is nothing new. The real test of being a Madridista isnt celebrating wins, its surviving the tough times. And we have done it before, we will do it again, and we will laugh at these meltdowns.",

He is still not bigger than Isco and Bale in my eyes, but his ego is like Prime CR7. First he goes on to create tension in the dressing rooms just because he got subbed out and eventually gets Xabi sacked. Didn\u2019t even show courtesy to drop a farewell message. And the only moments when we needed him to step up this season, he failed miserably. I used to support this guy with all my heart during his Zidane era but now he\u2019s been getting on my nerves. I genuinely believe we will be a much better team without him in the squad. And all the other players who are behind him will get a necessary reality check that no player is bigger than this club. I want Bernabeu to boo the crap out of him in the next home match. \n\nAs for other players in the squad, I genuinely don\u2019t wanna see Fran Garcia, Raul Asencio and Mastantuono starting any time soon.\n\nI have my biases for Alaba, Mendy and  Rudiger but even their time has come\n\nWe need a very significant makeover in the summer if we want to compete for anything ever again.\n\n",

        "content": "Look, I\u2019m not just talking for drama, there\u2019s legitimate reasons why the atmosphere should be tense this weekend.\n\nWe just got knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Albacete, a second-division side, in one of the most humiliating results in recent history. That was Arbeloa\u2019s debut as coach and it wasn\u2019t even close to respectable.\n\nXabi Alonso is gone after only seven months,a manager who was supposed to be the next big thing, and we\u2019re already in managerial chaos.\n\nMeanwhile the fans inside the club are already openly questioning Florentino. On Reddit threads today people are demanding Perez step down, calling his decisions ego-driven and disconnected from what this team actually needs.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget the wider fallout:  \n\u2022 The squad looks completely lost on the pitch, no identity, no consistency, even longtime supporters are calling this a meltdown unlike anything they\u2019ve seen.  \n\u2022 There\u2019s tension over plans to potentially open up ownership structures and bring in outside investment, something a lot of socios aren\u2019t happy about.  \n\u2022 Florentino\u2019s constant attacks on refereeing and the whole Negreira saga have drawn public pushback from the Spanish referees\u2019 association.\n\nSo yeah, if the Bernab\u00e9u doesn\u2019t let them hear it with whistles and boos this Saturday, I\u2019ll be genuinely surprised.\n\nLet\u2019s see if these people inside the club actually feel the pressure they\u2019ve created.",

And don't be mistaken  Real madrid is heading (again) down the manchester united path or even worse. this administration is completely outdated and old ad senile. This is 2026, the concept of playing superstars and relying on  the to shine is not feasible. Why ? because :\n\n1) Real madrid does not have a stacked deck like in 2016. way to many overrated and moody at best players. the only decent 'superstar' is Mbappe. And even then he is not good enough to build an ENTIRE system on him alone. \n\n2) buying ready superstars, is too expensive. our Club just ran out of all it's elite veterans that made it seem easy. especially in midfield with modric and kroos.\n\n3) Football has become more intense and more team oriented. people seem to forget that although there were a lot of egos in 2016+ but they were so good at their roles that they synchronized into an unstoppable team. this is definitely not the case for these current players.\n\nAlonso was just disappointed by how immature and very unprofessional these players are. and the rest of the fans will soon know it.",

If we wanted to experiment and ruin Arbeloa\u2019s career why not bring someone who knows how to atleast bring the team to some conscience?\n\nArbeloa is going to be hated with the bigger disaster on the horizon and no one is going to take the repercussions. The board will sack him and get new one. Why not just get Khabib for a month and just get back to at least having players who behaves. ",

Vini is the only player that didn\u2019t lost a farewell message to xabi. He was the most player that wanted xabi out because xabi was the first brave coach that caught up with his bullshit and started subbing him which vini didn\u2019t like. Vinicius plays 1 good game and he dips again for 10 games. Mbappe was saving our asses game after another (almost) im not saying mbappe doesn\u2019t have some flaws but what i know is he was more help than a problem for us more than vini jr. ",
