He had left that position far behind before even coming to Madrid. Even at the 2020 Euros, when France had literally Benzema as a striker, they were still playing 3-4-1-2, with both Benzema and Mbappe as CF\n\nIt can also be seen that he has had better stats as CF too.\n\nCompare that to Vini, who won the best player in the world award(FIFA the Best) and came second in Ballon d'Or, being one of the main reason Real Madrid had their most succesful season since the 1960's, as a LEFT WINGER.\n\n  \nVini was straight up the best winger in football, for at least 3 years. Even now he has more G/A than any other winger in the world, except for Bayern's\n\n",

He will be fantastic for Real Madrid)\n\nCarlo had clearer instructions for defenders. For attackers, it was more about finding ways to liberate them, to find spaces for them to sign. No set philosophy, no strict tactical setup, no demand on what players to sign and what kind. But an old school manager with a good grasp of modern football. I think for big European nights, Carlo (along with Zizou- but they do have similar traits) will always be the one we think of for a long long time. It wasn't always pretty, but boy did they grind out results.. What a man!",

The Welshman lamented the\u00a0**\"lack of quality\"**\u00a0in the final third, directly pointing to figures like Mbapp\u00e9 and Vinicius J\u00fanior:\u00a0**\"They didn\u2019t produce any magic. It was disappointing that in the final third there wasn\u2019t the quality you expect from Real Madrid\"**. A statement that highlights the club\u2019s reliance on individual brilliance that, on big nights, doesn\u2019t always show up.\n\nThis offensive shortcoming led Bale to identify a structural need: the arrival of a reference center forward. The former footballer explained that crosses and attacking moves were left without a finisher, an obvious tactical gap.\u00a0**\"Sometimes you need to go and test the defender. There was no one in the box for the crosses. Maybe you need a \u20189\u2019\"**, he concluded, hitting the nail on the head regarding the role of a classic striker.",

The hypocrisy is insane.\n\nJust saw a post with Mbapp\u00e9 circled in yellow like, \u201clook, he didn\u2019t close down on that Carreras run!\u201d \n\nBro, have you even *played* football? You think it\u2019s that fucking simple? You think all he had to do was magically predict the ball\u2019s bounce and slot it in? Be serious.\n\nEveryone has off days man. You, me, and our players. Liverpool were just better yesterday. That happens. You can\u2019t win every goddamn game. I wish we were the better team, we weren't. That's that.\n\nWhat really pisses me off though is the hate. The straight-up disrespect toward world-class players \u2014 it\u2019s pure *small dick energy*. You don\u2019t have to love everyone, but at least don\u2019t act like you could do better sitting on your ass behind a keyboard.\n\nIf you love this club, act like it. Stop scapegoating. Stop turning on our own. You think throwing shit on a player makes you a smart? No it just makes you look like a clown.\n\nGo outside. Touch some fucking grass. Play an actual 11v11 game. Try tracking back, closing down, finding a smart pass (like G\u00fcler tried before getting chopped down in the box), or making a perfect run. You\u2019ll realize half of what you complain about isn\u2019t that simple.\n\nAnd sure let\u2019s talk football, that\u2019s fine by me. For instance, Valverde was uncomfortable at times? Yeah. But he wasn\u2019t ass. He was just out of position. There\u2019s a difference. \n\nThe quality of this sub has fallen off a cliff.\nIf you love this club act like it. Stop being salty little crybabies every time we lose. \n\nOur club is stacked with quality, and we have a top manager too. If it was some other manager and we weren't defensively disciplined it would've been much worse. I am still confident we're the best team in Europe. THE BEST! A 1-0 loss changes nothing.\n\nHala Madrid Y Nada Mas \ud83e\udd0d\n",

Usually midfielders showed world class quality relatively late but peaked longer. Historically, I think we often relied on experienced midfielders, rarely providing regular starting chances for young midfield talents.   \n  \nSince the departure of Kroos and Modric, it's been a long time since we have to worry about our midfield. Nowadays, top midfield talents are rare in the market and the best midfielders are not for sale. Comparing with previous time, our club seems to invest more in youngsters mostly recent years, usually below age 20. We are lucky to have Bellingham, Guler, Camavinga in our squad now, who are still young and developing. But obviously expectations inside and outside the club is high as winning trophies is an absolute must every year.  \n  \nKnowing the difference of the expectation in our club (where success is needed immediately rather than rebuilding or long term developing) and other clubs (where long term developing is often emphasized), how do we compare our current midfielders when they were at age 20 - expecially our youngest midfielder Guler, with other midfielders past and present when they were still at age 20, such as Zidane, Modric, Kroos, Ozil, KDB, Iniesta, Xavi, Scholes, Lampard, Gerrard, Pirlo, Vitinha, Rodri, Pedri, and many more?",

Not sure what to do or how to create spark in the dullness. \n\nBy the way, has he gotten slightly chubbier? \nWhat do you reckon his market value is? ",

        "title": "Just play Jude as a false 9 and let others take up the defensive duties",
        "content": "Jude as a 9 gave us a league and champions league. Let Mbappe and Vini operate on the wings and Jude be that reference. With Valverde back in midfield and Trent at tight back it can easily be done. The decision in attack should be between Arda and Vini similar to Ancelotti with Rodrygo or Valverde and Zidane with Isco or Bale. But Jude and Mbappe like Benzema and Vini before and before that Benzema and Ronaldo have to be there. Always need a big man like Benz and Jude to facilitate the play and bully defenders while creating magic for a goal scoring killer like Vini, mbappe, or Ronaldo to score. \n\nIf the game requires a 3rd attacker then play Vini if not play a midifelder like Arda. \n\nTough decisions, but respect to Zidane for making it work. Especially since he lived this situation under the gal\u00e1cticos where Figo, him, Ra\u00fal, and Ronaldo were all trying to fit which weakend the midfield. Casemiro, Modric, Kroos, and Benzema was key. And with Arda improving his defending everyday, could even see him in the Modric role, but still needs a lot of time and experience under pressure before that is an option. \n\nEdit: Think I've touched a midfielder/attacker Goals/assist argument nerve some dudes have with Barca pedri fans. Not my intention at all. I'm just seeing a lack of strength and creativity up top with Mbappe doing a lot of heavy lifting with Jude able to contribute more offensively if he was played in a more effective position for the team.
