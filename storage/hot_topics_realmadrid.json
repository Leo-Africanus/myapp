This is the key missing piece that has led to our horrendous season this year. It allows our fullbacks and midfielders to have less pressure defensively. There is a reason that we won 4 champions with Casemiro in that role and then 1 champions with Tchouameni there. Playing Tchouameni at center back was Carlo's mistake for he \"solved\" a problem which then opened up a bigger problem. Our attack became disconnected from our back line and we recovered less balls. Bellingham and Valverde were constantly scrambling to cover the fullbacks which left the middle of the field exposed forcing our centerbacks to press and get cooked. And when they cover the middle, our centerbacks are forced to support the fullbacks and they get cooked. \n\nWe win more duels up the field when Tchouam\u00e9ni is there. Just throw any random center back there and let Tchouameni cook. ",

        "title": "Sergio Ramo's 92:48 equalizer is by far the most important in our club's history...",
        "content": "After watching Barcelona\u2019s second leg against Inter Milan, I\u2019ve started to think that even us Real Madrid fans, don\u2019t fully grasp just how unbelievable it is to have won 15 Champions League titles. This Barcelona team looked capable of beating anyone in the world, pulling off comebacks after comebacks. Yet, they didn\u2019t win it. Because in the end it all comes down to mentality- something they\u2019ve lacked for most of the past decade.\n\nWe won the Champions League in 2002 with a superb team featuring Raul, Zidane, Makelele, Figo, Hierro, and Roberto Carlos. After that, we signed even more global superstars like Ronaldo Nazario, David Beckham etc, only to face repeated humiliation in the Champions League. Were we not good enough? No, we simply lacked that X-factor.\n\nBy 2012, we had a phenomenal team under Mourinho that managed to stop one of the best Barcelona sides in history from winning La Liga. But we still bottled the semifinals against Bayern Munich, a tie we absolutely should have won. Ig it was just destiny at the end.\n\nThen came 2014. We reached the final against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. They took the lead around the 30th minute and defended with everything they had for the rest of the game. We created plenty of chances, many of which should have been finished, but we failed to convert them. By the 85th minute, I had given up hope. Most of us had. After a decade of coming up short in these kinds of moments, it felt all too familiar. But then came that iconic Ramos header in stoppage time, and everything changed. For the first time in what felt like forever, we came back from behind in a Champions League knockout game. From that point on, the victory felt inevitable. Atl\u00e9tico were drained, and we finished the job. But it had an ever-lasting impact on this club's legacy.\n\nSince then, we\u2019ve gone on to win five more Champions League titles. Each run has been filled with close matches and incredible comebacks. Whether you call it luck or the X-factor, there\u2019s something unique about this club. We simply don\u2019t give up.\n\nAnother reason for our success is our adaptability. Against Manchester City in both 2022 and 2024, we defended with everything we had. A lot of big clubs wouldn\u2019t do that, out of pride or because they\u2019re married to a particular style. We aren\u2019t tied down by ideology. Look at Barcelona. After taking the lead against Inter, they kept trying to score again instead of wasting time and locking the game down because they didn\u2019t want to go against their principles. That stupid decision cost them a place in the Champions League final.\n\nMoreover, since 2014, nearly every major club has suffered heartbreak in the Champions League. Every single one\u2014except Real Madrid. And in the end, it all comes down to that one Ramos header.",

        "content": "A lot of YT videos going around about how Xabi could use his Leverkusen tactics at Real Madrid. 3 at the back, one offensive wingback, one defensive wingback, 2 pivots, 2 #10 and a #9:\n\n           ST\n        LAM   RAM\n    LWB           RWB\n         LCM  RCM\n       CB  CB  CB\n\nHow would you lineup our players into this formation?\n\nMy biggest concern regarding this setup is Vini. There are really 2 options:\n\na) LAM: everyone is putting him into this role. I think Vini performs exponentially worse the further he is from the touchline. In the center of the pitch, he has bad vision, bad first touch and makes a lot of wrong passes.\n\nb) LWB: no body mentioned this option because he would need to defend. But look at Frimpong's (RWB at Leverkusen) heatmap at one match:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zp79yr3cutze1.png?width=637&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=104371cbdee5ccc47b17bda388a036121cac038b\n\nThat's something where i can see Vini excel! Especially if left with a lot of 1v1 situations.\n\nI can imagine something like:\n\n         Mbappe\n       Jude   Arda\n    Vini           Trent\n         Cama  Fede\n     Rudi  ???  Asencio\n\noverloading the right side with Trent, Arda, Jude, Mbappe and even Fede/Cama/Tchou, then Trent sending a diagonal to the isolated Vini on the left.",

        "content": "Xabi is here, and I am very excited. However, we still have a lot of holes, and I think it is naive that our roster as is fine. We have massive holes in the defense, and the midfield. \n\n  \nThe first issue is 3ATB, or 4 back? With Trent now too, I am more convinced we will not be playing 3ATB with Xabi. Either way has issues however. Would Flo let us play 3ATB? \n\n  \nDefense \n\n* 3ATB -- Rudiger, Militao, Asencio + Alaba off the bench, this is a pretty decent back 3, but the injury concerns are very real, as well as depth. \n* 4Back - Rudiger + Militao, with Trent at RB. What happens to Carvajal, and LB will still likely be a disaster. Which I don't think they address this off-season\n* Especially if they get Huisen. Which I think we need, and would solve A LOT of issues defensively in regards to depth + quality. Could ease Militao/Rudi back (finally), Alaba would be an emergency defender at LB and CB, Asencio would be a fantastic bench option. \n* I do think 3ATB would help the LB issues as long as we sign Huisen however. \n* Then Joan Martinez -- coming off ACL. I saw him live, he was remarkable against Milan, and was way better than Asecnio in the academy. I think he can be a real player for us when Alaba or Rudiger inevitably leave in the next 2 years. \n\nMidfield \n\n* This is one of the issues I think Xabi helps solve off his tactics. We still ideally need a circulator, but I think even in a 4Back, he greatly fixes the build up issues. \n* I also think Guler will play a massive role next year, and he likely is the player they think will play that circulator roll. And I am not surprised if Xabi is very intrigued by him.\n\n  \nAttack \n\n* I not only think he should go for squad reasons, but Rodrygo should go to raise funds imo. Especially because Xabi has not played with 3 forwards much, the third attacker if he uses one is probably Jude. \n* Which would leave us with Mbappe + Vini + Endrick + Brahim + Guler (kinda) Which I think is fine. Maybe an academy player, which we might be more prone to use under Xabi than Carlo. \n\n  \nMacro Things\n\n* Is he going to get MBappe or Vini to press?\n* Is there any chance of a LB?\n* What happens to Carvajal when he comes back? \n* I actually do think if Huisen is signed we would be well to play 3ATB, but doubt it happens. I think this 3-4-1-2 would be pretty killer.  \n   * Asencio / Huisen / Rudiger (depth is a little bit of an issue, but Joan + Alaba + MIlitao playing more reserve roles is fine probably?)\n   * Guler / Tchouameni / Fede / Trent \n   * Jude \n   * Vini/Mbappe\n\n",

Why do they not prepare some serious documentaries about this case?\n\nI would love to know the actual responsibilities of Negreira and if it is true his reports were the basis for promoting and demoting referees.\n\nIf this is true, I would like to know if there are statistical correlations between referees demoted and promoted by Negreira and average points won/ lost by Bar\u00e7a with those referees vs averages.\n\nI would like to know if it is true that Negreira son was acting as referees personal driver in home games in Barcelona and was warning referees about avoiding mistakes that could damage Bar\u00e7a.\n\nWhy Referee organisation has not condenmened those payments?\n\nWhat are the appoinents by Negreira still in management positions or in active Referee?\n\nAre there any retired referees willing to talk about this? Can RMTV find any?\n\nAre two consecutive years without a penalty against Bar\u00e7a in La liga an statistical anomaly? What was the actual chance for that to happen? Has it ever happened before to any club in the world?",

        "content": "He fits the club\u2019s policy to sign young and up and coming players. He\u2019s already a big big player in the premier league which is one of the most difficult/physical in the world, especially as a CB. As expected a host of big clubs have already courted him. Also, dont get why people say \u201ches unproven\u201d. When you play week in week out for such a good side and get called up for spain and is the starting cb, idk how much more proven you can find at his age. Secondly, the boy is a Madrid fan. He seemingly loves madrid and his fav is our very own Ramos. Finally, his price. I know his release clause of 50m is a bit steep and madrid has refrained for going for high cost players lately but the fact that they dont have to outbid any clubs and the player himself is willing to join makes everything so much more straightforward. I say get the guy in",
