        "content": "I had completely lost hope in Tchouameni but I felt like I saw a new player today His reading of the game on aerial balls was crazy, he made no mistakes and was solid and above all he showed character when he played in midfield. He may not be the Rodri we need but if he continues like this and tries to erase his faults he will be able to shut all mouths (including mine)\nHe has the physique and technique that are very, very above average for a defender, and when he plays with his qualities like today he is a sure bet. Maybe he will show the qualities to play in midfield, but I don't want to get my hopes up too much. ",
