I\u2019m coming from Ireland so there\u2019s abit of a logistical problem involved but my main issue is trying to get a ticket. I\u2019m not sure if tickets are out yet but i\u2019m seeing \u2018sponsored\u2019 ticket reseller sites already have them up for 700 euros. I know that clasico tickets are expensive but i think 700 euros is a stretch. Is this price normal for clasico? Also i would like to know how you guys would actually go about getting a ticket to guarantee a place but not break the bank like (mid tier) at the same time if possible. ",

        "title": "Should Madrid let go of rodrygo this summer ?",
        "content": "From what is reported , 80 million to 90 million euros sum will be needed to get rodrygo out of Madrid but this was few weeks ago ,cause dispite everything  he still would be the best winger available in market this summer but I hope we fetch as much money as possible. In my opinion a 85 million + 10 million would be a good deal , guessing clubs like arsenal and bayern are after him and bayern specially has a lot of money from writz failed transfer . What will be the best decision going forward, if it's to sell how much money the club so ask for ?",
