        "content": "Just a quick Raul Asencio appreciation post! What an incredible gem of a player he is... a no-nonsense CB who focuses on the game and blocks out distractions. Given that he's playing on the big stage for the first time, his confidence, reading of the game, and ability are absolutely astonishing. I'm in awe of how good he's turning out to be. He played another flawless game tonight, and I genuinely love watching him. Everything about his game is outstanding... from his reading of the play to his on-ball qualities, courage, and impeccable ability to block balls with sliding tackles. His ability to clear the ball in dangerous areas while keeping a level head is impressive. I'm at a loss for words to praise his abilities. What a gem of a player we've discovered this season!\n\nAnd I love how down-to-earth he is. When asked if he's earned a starting spot, his humble response was, 'No, I just work day to day and let the coach decide.' I loved his response - this is how legends are made, with dedication, commitment, and hard work. And he has all those qualities. \n\nHopefully, Our future captain!:) ",
