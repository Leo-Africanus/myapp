Is it because he performs much worse than Rodrygo, Brahim or Modric in training sessions? Against Bar\u00e7a we were 5-1 down and all the substitutes, not one of them was Arda. Even Fran Garcia came on when RM  needed goals. Is he not training enough? Or does he have some psychological problems or maybe he does not get on well with other people? I can't put my finger on it.\n\nI understand that Modric is great and all that, but no matter what the score is, he comes on first, even if we are 3-0 up or 3-0 down. Similar with Rodrygo. He's good, but even though he plays badly and can't do anything, he always gets full minutes. I wonder what the reason is that we can't see.\n\nI really want to know what is going wrong there.",

        "content": "Nobody could\u2019ve anticipated the injuries that happened this season or known that the defense would falter so much when relying on Tchouameni and Vazquez, but in hindsight it seems clear that Nacho would\u2019ve been incredibly useful as a solid, experienced CB/RB to cover for injured players. He had his own reasons for leaving as he deserved more playing time elsewhere, and will always be remembered as a legend, but I can\u2019t help but wonder how much he might\u2019ve helped the team so far this season.",
