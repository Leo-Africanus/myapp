Anyone who doubted him in the first place is a clown, cuz there is no way that you watched this guy play games (not on insta reels) and still end up saying he's a \"waste\". Theirry henry went out on sky sports and said rodrygo is not normal. Jude bellingham himself went out and publicly called rodrygo the most talented player in the squad. \n\nYou can't blame a guy for not scoring in 32 games when he only started in 4 of them. Laliga today is just Barca, Real and 18 other teams that play nothing but low block football. You can't expect rodrygo to get subbed in and score a hattrick everytime. Vini hasn't scored in 12 games so far no one's making that much noise about it.\n\nHe came on against almaty in the 60-70th min and provided 2 assists. Went in to his 2nd ucl start this season against city and he immediately scored, is that a coincidence? I don't think so.

        "title": "It is everyone\u2019s fault",
        "content": "I\u2019ve been watching Real Madrid since 2000, and this era is starting to remind me of the Gal\u00e1cticos era.\n\nWe had unreal individual talent back then, but as a collective, it never truly clicked. I\u2019m starting to feel the same pattern now: too much talent, not enough cohesion, and unclear leadership from the top.\n\nUpper Management\n\nThis situation starts with upper management. Their lack of clear and public support for Xabi is a major issue. We\u2019ve seen this story before  it\u2019s exactly why Zidane walked away during his second stint. When a coach feels like every match is a final, it creates fear, not progress.\n\nXabi is constantly under pressure, with the feeling that one bad result could cost him his job. Realistically, how many coaches can work intelligently and build something long-term under that threat? Upper management needs to be decisive: either fully back Xabi or just fire him and bring back Carlo lol.\n\nFlorentino also needs to be firm with Vini. Either sign the contract or accept reduced minutes. No one, regardless of talent, should be bigger than the club. If others are performing better or fitting the system, they deserve playing time.\n\nSquad planning has also been poor. Madrid should have signed more players. We are clearly short in defense  at least one or two more center-backs were needed \u2014and we desperately need another midfielder who can consistently progress the ball and control tempo. Right now, we\u2019re relying too much on individual brilliance instead of structure same as the Carlo era.\n\nPlayers\n\nSeveral players have been underperforming since last season, and not enough has changed. Jude needs to accept that replicating his 23/24 season is unrealistic. That season was exceptional, and asking him to carry the team again isn\u2019t fair to him or the squad.\n\nVini hasn\u2019t been at his best, and honestly, I think his contract situation is affecting him. He\u2019s an emotional player, and when his head isn\u2019t right, it shows. I believe once his future is settled, we\u2019ll see a much better version of him again.\n\nThat said, Vini\u2019s moment at El Cl\u00e1sico hurt the team\u2019s morale. Leadership isn\u2019t just about talent \u2014 it\u2019s about composure. When emotions take over, the entire team feels it. Believe me I love Vini and I have every kit that he wore since he joined Real except this season. It breaks my heart to see him like this.\n\nDefensively, many of the goals we\u2019ve conceded come from the same issue, half the team presses while the other half stands and watches. That\u2019s not just a player problem  that\u2019s a system and communication problem.\n\nXabi Alonso\n\nDespite everything, I\u2019m still on Xabi\u2019s side. He showed real promise earlier this season, and he\u2019s been dealt with injuries, ego management, and a squad that wasn\u2019t fully built for his ideas or players that want to believe in his system. \n\nI used to complain a lot about Carlo because we lacked a clear tactical identity. The \u201cCarlo system\u201d relied too heavily on individual moments, and that approach isn\u2019t sustainable long-term. Xabi, at least, is trying to implement a structure  but structure takes time.\n\nThat said, Xabi isn\u2019t blameless. He should have handled Vini better in El Cl\u00e1sico instead of ignoring the situation. Managing stars is part of the job at Madrid.\n\nI also criticize the constant lineup changes. While injuries explain some of it, stability matters. Players need chemistry, especially in midfield and defense.\n\nFinally, Xabi needs to recognize that Jude and Arda cannot play together if Jude is our number 10. The balance just isn\u2019t there, and it hurts both players rather than helping either of them.",
