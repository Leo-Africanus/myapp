        "title": "Firing Xabi won't change anything. What we need to learn from United (depressingly)",
        "content": "Mourinho, Ole Gunnar, Rangnick, Ten Hag, Amorim. All of these recent UTD manegess have had many problems, but one is main, the player power is too much. Pogba, Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Harry Maguire, Dalot, CR7(only in 2022/23). These guys shouldn't start for United, but they did because of player power at the club, and because the managers don't have power or ego to not play them.\n\nAt this moment, we're going through something similar here. Vinicius making a mess on the field when being subbed agasing Barca after having a good game really soured relations. And his \"apology\" not even talking about Xabi. People say it isn't a big deal but just think of being disrespected in the biggest game of football and the apology you are owed doesn't even have your name.\n\nBut what's worse is, it worked. Vini has started every game and has been worse than mediocre.\n\nNot to dwell on Vini too much. Guler, and Valverde are still starting. I know we don't have Midfield options but using 2 out of form players in the midfield is asking for trouble\n\nXABI BENCHED MASTANTUONO AFTER MANY CHANCES BECAUSE HE WASNT PERFORMING. This is important. I know Mastantuono doesn't have any goodwill at the club but him being able to see this at the start of the season and not now is concerning.\n\nUsual points- no gametime to Endrick or Gonzalo, trusting Rodrygo to turn the game around after he has been benched for 6 months. Concerning managing all around.\n\nPoint is--  FIRING XABI AND GSTTING ANOTHER MANAGER EONT CHANGE ANYTHING. Time and time again, if you have 5 \"superstar level\" players, however much you try player power will prevail.\n\nTL;DR- Player power will ruin the club. Managers can't do anything if it's not someone like 2010 Mourinho or 2009 Pep.",

        "content": "It's not like his stuff never worked, his stuff worked. As long as we can press with intensity.\n\nbut he couldn't keep it for certain reasons. Even in the CWC he had used Fran Garcia quite well, letting him charge into the box to create threat.\n\nHe was also right to use Franco as RM to bring more balance/pressing and let Rodygo rotate with Vini as a LW, where he played much better. But things all changed.\n\nLike Rodrygo, Xabi was right to use him rotate Vini on the left, where he plays much better. And use Franco as RM to bring balance. But now he used him as RW and it didn't work well at all.\n\nIt has to do with his decision ,but most likely the dressing room also played the part, if we just fire him now. The problem would not be solved. I think his top priority is to let the players do what he had asked instead of being too easy on the stars and harsh on the youngsters(Endrick).  Remember 2019? Lopetegui was sacked so quickly also because he was too afraid to touch the star players. Solari could at least let the things work for a while because he had the balls to take off players and use youngsters. Till this day I still thank him.\n\nI really think a big mistake Xabi had made was being too easy on Vini after the Barca incident. I'm not saying Vini did something super evil or not playing well after. But no punishment(starting up in the Valencia game) simply let the players think \"hi we can do whatever we want without consequences\" Hiddink also mentioned it in the ESPN interview.\n\nWhat can save Xabi now is himself, he got to have the guts to do what he wanted the players to play, at the same time improve on the structure in time. If he couldn't do that, then he 100% would need to leave.",

        "title": "We have to get rid of the untouchables mentality",
        "content": "The biggest issue we have right now is the untouchables problem. We have a group of players who know they will start every game no matter how they perform. When players feel safe from being benched, intensity drops. They play without urgency, they stop tracking back, they stop making the extra effort, and the whole team suffers for it.\n\nThis is exactly what is happening with Vini, Mbappe, Jude, and Fede. These are great players, but they have reached a point where they are never held accountable. They know they will not get subbed off, even when they are having a bad game. That creates a culture where performance becomes optional. It is one of the reasons we struggle when we dominate possession. The players become too relaxed because they know nothing will happen if they lose the ball or waste chances. It doesn't click in their minds that playing like this will cause us to lose a game until the 80th minute. Then suddenly there is urgency to win.\n\nYou could see the difference in today\u2019s game against Celta. We only started playing well and actually running after the red card reduced us to ten men. Suddenly, the team had no choice but to attack with urgency. The reason we played well against barca is because they dominate possession therefor we are forced to attack the moment we win the ball. Urgency changes everything. When the team feels pressure, players push themselves. Without it, the effort drops.\n\nThe solution is simple and necessary. We need to make it clear that no player is above the club. If someone is playing poorly, they come off. If someone is not defending, they get subbed. If someone keeps losing the ball, they sit on the bench next game. It does not matter how talented they are or how many trophies they have won. Other top clubs treat their stars the same way. Even Yamal gets subbed when he is off his game. So why do we protect our players like they are untouchable?\n\nUntil we fix this mentality, nothing will change. Talent alone will not win us games when hunger disappears. The club must come first. Always. Hala madrid! ",

        "content": "Listen I understand that some of the players are part of the problem but please tell me how that excuses us getting outplayed by all of these teams? Just look at the liverpool game, he put cama on the RW and arda as a DM against szoboszlai and gravenberch, that's basically suicide, we stood no chance. And then against vallecano we couldn't create more than once chance, and the elche game was also bad. Against olympiacos we weren't even that good, and they would've equalized or even won if it wasn't for some great saves from lunin. That girona game was the worst match of football I've seen in the past few years. The bilbao game was good but they didn't play a low block and their defense is terrible, either way I thought it was good but today I got reminded that our coach still has zero solutions for teams that sit back. Elche beat girona 3-0 and we needed a pen to draw with them. At least last season carlo had an excuse since he had terrible defenders but there's no excuse for a coach with these players to be getting dominated like this. How can you look completely toothless against celta vigo at home?? He still doesn't even have a starting 11 and he makes terrible subs. At the end of the day a manager that gives 2025 brahim diaz so many minutes is questionable to me.  It's funny how he saw every team realize we only have attackers on the left and just shut us down, yet he NEVER gave endrick a chance on the RW. It's hard to feel bad for a coach like this honestly, but I'm not saying he should get sacked yet, I just don't like seeing everyone make excuses for him and act like he's been good or something.",

        "content": "Xabi can now be judged more fairly against Don Carlo because he\u2019s facing the same type of adversity Ancelotti dealt with. With several of his key signings, many of the same profiles Carlo requested, lost to injury or suspension, Xabi is finally experiencing what it means to scramble for solutions in real time. He now understands the frustration of preparing for big games with half a squad unavailable and being forced to rely on players like Lucas V\u00e1zquez, who always steps up but isn\u2019t meant to be the centerpiece of a title-chasing team. This stretch will reveal Xabi\u2019s adaptability, man-management, and tactical creativity in the same pressure cooker Carlo survived for years, making the comparison between the two far more legitimate.",
