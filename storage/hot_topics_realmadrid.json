        "content": "It's certain that Rodrygo will be leaving, which is kind of sad. The club has stated that if a player departs, they will sign a new player . I believe we will most likely look for a center-back since Rudiger is much better positioned as a center center-back. Tchouameni is also essential in midfield, as we saw in the last match against Juventus. \n\nSo, the question is: who does Real Madrid actually need? There are currently two world-class options available. Bastoni, a left-footed player from Inter, has excellent ball-playing ability and could take on a role similar to Hincapie's role . Dean would be moved to the right flank, where he typically plays in Spain. With Rudiger as the center center-back, we could have a more composed backline. He might be a feasible option now, especially since Inter is struggling financially. The next target is ibrahima konate which is most likely option   a right footed center back  a fast no nonsense defender  and he also put on a great display against vini jr with him we could see him on the right flank dean would stay where he is rn so yeah let me know your opinion on that \n\nI forgot mention konate has also refused to sign a new deal at liverpool his contract is expiring next season \n\n\nStop down voting me please I litterly have a new account thank you ",
