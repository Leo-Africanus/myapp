A potential foul afterwards in the box is challenged for review by Arbeloa\n\n90'+2 - after a very long review, the ref decides no penalty\n\n\ud83d\udfe5 90'+6 - second yellow for Lamini who makes a stupid and unnecessary tactical foul while already on a yellow \n\nFT - a decent second half is too little after league leaders Tenerife had already decided the match in the first. A 1-3 loss against what is clearly the best team in the division is normally no shame, but with now 4 losses in a row and multiple players missing the next weeks due to the U20 World Cup + Fettal injured and Lamini now suspended, the situation is looking extremely dire and hopeless for Arbeloa's team.

The leaders of the dressing room tries to hide and hang their heads rather than leading the team and motivating them to make a comeback.",

I saw some people talking about benching or maybe even selling players like fede and jude and rodrygo. Jude came back from injury, yeah it was a bad decision for him to start, but we know the quality he brings to the team, he's a maestro on the ball, let's just give him some time to get adjusted again, and fede?? Holy, criticism is completely fair but this sub is filled with reactionary fans, what would happen to you if you supported your local team where they barely win anything.   \nI swear I'll lose my mind if I see another post on why some player should be benched or sold or that he's shit or doesn't fit the system, from what we know of xabi, he's not reluctant to change the system, he'll adapt with the players he has, you just gotta trust in him",

Carreras and Vini are often hugging the same space with Vini rarely linking up with Carreras or crashing the CF spot in the box like how CR7 did when Marcelo would make his daunting forward runs. Bellingham is almost always too far from Tchou and Fede. Tchou and Fede dont compliment each other as CM and DMs should do. Arda is not a traditional winger and if he leaves his RW spot to playmake or smooth out the possession distribution, the whole Right side structure collapses.\n\nI dont think this 4-3-3 is made for Real Madrid with the current profile of players we have.\n\nWhen we played against PSG in the CWC, the inclusion of Mbappe forced us into 4-3-3 with Gonzalo Garcia pseudo RW and the gaping holes were again there for them to exploit. In my opinion the distance between our three midfielders is almost always comical whenever we play from the back against a high pressing opponents.",

        "content": "It still  hurts. The biggest reason for the defeat was predictability. Xabi himself said a few days ago that we need to be less predictable, but when it came to the match nothing really changed.\n\nAt Leverkusen, one thing I loved about him was how balanced the attack was. Around 33% down the left and through the center and  on the right. Here with us it\u2019s always the same pattern everything goes through the left, we were successful in previous matches when doing this but we can leave the center empty, and the right side barely exists. Opponents know exactly what\u2019s coming.\n\nIn previous matches, when Mastantuono was starting, we actually had some balance because the kid gave us a real threat on the right. But taking that option away made us repeat the same mistake from last season. Rushing Bellingham back and sacrificing the RW just made things worse and honestly felt like a rookie mistake.\n\nThen came the bad luck too. No Trent, and Carvajal\u2019s injury took away the last bit of threat we had on the right. With both out, we were way too one-dimensional.\n\nIt's good this happened this early, We\u2019ll bounce back. Xabi learns fast, and he will fix these mistakes.\n\nHala Madrid.",

        "content": "Benzema only started to play when Gonzalo Higua\u00edn got injured. At the time, Mourinho wasn't considering Benzema a decent striker, calling Benzema a cat and saying that he preferred to hunt with dogs, not cats, and he had no choice. \n\nBenzema ended up being the second-highest goal scorer for Real Madrid with 354 goals, behind Ronaldo's 450 goals. And the numbers say that if he had taken the penalties that Ronaldo scored, he would've been the top scorer. However, Benzema wasn't as big as the CR7 Brand, which is why he couldn't take penalties. In the 2019-2020 season, if Benzema had taken the 11 La Liga penalties, he would've won the Pechichi, but Ramos was the first choice after Ronaldo left. And that's also why the squad didn't crumble. Benzema's disposition made him not chase stardom or seek the spotlight. \n\nOn the other hand, Perez preferred Benzema over Ronaldo, criticizing Ronaldo on multiple occasions, calling Ronaldo an \"Imbecile\" and Mourinho \"Abnormal.\" Of course, it would be natural to say that he would have preferred Benzema to take the penalties, but the CR7 halo effect was stronger, and the team needed Ronaldo to compete with Messi's Barcelona. \n\nBenzema settled as the second man; he assisted 14% of Ronaldo's goals, helping Ronaldo shine more, which solved the huge problem of having more than one star on the team. he had the confidence within him to become the shadow of Ronaldo. That's exactly what Zidane did during the Galacticos, when he played deeper, not to compete with the others on scoring. \n\n  \nWe can confidently say that Karim Benzema was the true hero working in the shadows. We need a Karim Benzema-like behavior. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y46opzqi84sf1.jpg?width=736&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62f19b459b929c4b2337a2df4ae8e42f86648da0\n\n",

You got fans in this sub who think we\u2019re going to win the league/CL by just having Guler spam a million through balls to Mbappe. Even Barcelona who has never been known for crossing the ball a lot, have an aerial threat in Lewandowski, and Raphinha is decent at scoring from crosses. \n\nOh, one more thing, can we sack our set piece coach asap? Atletico could have scored 3 goals from corners yesterday. Meanwhile, all our set pieces were absolute dogshit. ",

        "content": "This is no joke. Why when Real plays at 1PM local time we always play the worst football ever.\nAnd I mean always, I don't remember any good match played at this hour.\nSame with mondays.\nNot only it's inconvenient for the fans to watch the team the middle of the day and I feel like players are really unmotivated.\nIs there any logic reason behind this? I wonder what is the winrate of matches played at 1PM vs at 8PM.\n",

He\u2019s clearly talented and has shown glimpses of composure on the ball, but defensively he looked exposed today.Every aerial ball in the box was a goal. Do you think this game was more about his individual mistakes or a wider defensive collapse? Is he ready for Madrid minutes for big games?I really want him to succeed and hope he plays a lot this season",

        "title": "Management interference",
        "content": "It's quite puzzling that people will continue not pointing the finger where it should be pointed: squad planning.\n\nThe way I see it, this defeat and to a certain extent, the one against psg and the close call against Marseille, has a lot to do with not having a deep lying playmaker (DLP). Particularly one that can keep the ball under pressure, help build from the back, provide an outlet for the less technically gifted defenders and play through opponents' high pressure.\n\n* Guler plays too far forward to play fhat role, and he is easily dispossessed.\n* Tchouameni &amp; velverde are very limited passers and lack any vision or creativity or ability to retain the ball under pressure.\n* Bellingham might have what it takes but he wants to play forward and even when he did get that chance against atletico he didn't press high up the pitch like vini and mbappe and didn't bother to press their midfielders leaving the midfield completely open to Atl\u00e9tico.\n* Camavinga has an allergy towards playing the ball forward, he is also the most limited creatively among all our players including other positions, and his only somewhat decent attribute is his workrate (something we don't really need with valverde on the pitch). He offers nothing that the team needs and should be let go imo.\n\nThat leaves us with the only player who can actually offer what we need: Dani Ceballos. \nHe can retain the ball under pressure and force a foul if he's about to get dispossessed. He has a decent range of passing and forward passes. He presses the opposing midfielders well enough to give our defenders some much needed shielding and not give up the midfield to our opponents.\nThink of him as a modric-light kind of player with the obvious difference in level.\n\n\nNow, let's get to the issue at hand:\nDid xabi not know he needed a DLP? I think this is an unlikely notion. After all, he is one of the best DLPs to ever play the game and arguably one of the top 3 DLPs in Spanish football history. Not to mention the rumors in the summer about:\n1. Xabi asking for an additional midfielder, and the name being discussed was zubimendi, but the management vetoed that request.\n2. Xabi wanting modric to continue for one more season.\n3. Ceballos was about to leave to Marseille and even posted an Instagram picture about a farewell only for the deal to be halted somehow at the last minute. I'm willing to bet this was because of xabi.\n\nThis points me to this conclusion: xabi knew he needed a DLP, the management's answer was NO. Not only that, but they got rid of modric, tried to ship off ceballos and I wouldn't put it past them to have forced xabi to start bellingham instead of what we actually needed.\n\nIf this doesn't stop, there is little hope in the future of this club.",

        "content": "Took a while to process the loss and I really had to try to not let it affect my whole weekend. In saying this, I fully blame the loss on Alonso because its obvious the team selection was dog shit and rushing back Bellingham even though we all are happy he's recovered from surgery but playing him in a match of that caliber was a huge mistake.\n\nI think what made it even more shocking was that Alonso has played in these derbies as a player and he should have 1000 percent know the type of intensity that simeone and Atletico were coming with and it seems he underestimated this and paid for it but ultimately defeats like this are totally unacceptable. If we had lost 3-2 it would have been a sad loss but an understandable one but a Madrid team should never lose any match against any team by more than a 2 goal margin. I don't care how good the team is, if we need to play Mourinho type football to get the win of stop the bleeding then the player should fucking do that.\n\nAlso why have we collectively as a club decided that Ceballos cannot be a regular for madrid, there seems to be this idea going on that he's not madrid quality but funnily enough I don't remember him ever playing and us losing by a huge margin and if places on the team are truly based on merit then he should be playing and deserves a chance to prove and cement his place in the starting lineup just like any other expensive signing.\n\nOverall, these humiliating defeats need to stop, losing is a part of the game that we can accept but losing 4 nil and 5-2 like this is just not acceptable for a club of this standard and we as a fanbase should not accept it because its a slippery slope.",

Other players have had enough chance to make their marks in the mid, but what he\u2019s shown with the limited time he\u2019s had, has given him a head up to be our maestro. We have the pieces now to hide his defensive weaknesses and also to complement his strengths on offense. Xabi will have to make the call and get everyone on board sooner than later. Think early Messi or KDB. Passing geniuses who needed defensive help around them to keep their pocket open. He can have similar impact on the game if given the chance to control.  ",
