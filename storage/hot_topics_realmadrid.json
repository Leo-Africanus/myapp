        "content": "#FT: UNIONISTAS 3:0 CASTILLA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#1\u00aa FEDERACI\u00d3N\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:** \n\n1:0 Gast\u00f3n Vall\u00e9s 15'\n\n2:0 V\u00edctor Olmedo 78'\n\n3:0 \u00c1lvaro G\u00f3mez 81'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - kickoff, vamos! \n\n\u26bd 15' - goal for Unionistas - bad clearance in the box after a cross, and Fran can save the volley shot that followed on the rebound nicely at first - the ball comes to Unionistas' Valles though, and Fran jumps to early lying on the ground, making it easy for him to convert the rebound\n\nHT - possibly the best half of the season against Cacere\u00f1o is followed by one of the worst by Castilla, who can't find a way to control this match so far, are physically overwhelmed by Unionistas and couldn't create a noteworthy opportunity yet \n\n\ud83d\udd04 46' - 2nd half underway with a double sub, Aguado and Pol Fortuny on for Manu Serrano and Mesonero \n\n64' - best chance for Castilla after a solo run by Y\u00e1\u00f1ez - the keeper can save his curled shot at the far post\n\n71' - penalty for Unionistas, their player heads the ball onto Joan's arm from a short distance while he was walking backwards, very debatable... \n\n74' - the game is currently halted due to an electricity outage in the stadium \n\n\u26bd 78' - finally the game continues, Arbeloa's challenge is not succesful and Olmedo converts... \n\n\ud83d\udd04 79' - Cristian David on for David Jim\u00e9nez\n\n\u26bd 81' - game over for Castilla, pathetic free kick by Y\u00e1\u00f1ez that ends up becoming a dangerous counter instead - their attacker hits the post first, but the rebound, despite huge amounts of time and space for our defenders, is getting recovered by \u00c1lvaro G\u00f3mez, who finishes from a tight angle. Absolutely awful performance by Castilla\n\nFT - a performance to forget and a very deserved loss for Castilla, who couldn't find their usual flow and then got taken out for good by a quick double blow in the second half. A disappointing and surprisingly bad performance after the good match against Cacere\u00f1o, and they quickly need to brush it off before the next matchday\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 21:15 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Municipal Reina Sof\u00eda, Salamanca \n\n**Referee**: Aimar Velasco Arbaiza\n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 1, Matchday 13\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[LaLiga+](https://www.laligaplus.laliga.com/) (subscription - 14.99\u20ac/month) (only available in Spain)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-3-3): Fran Gonz\u00e1lez - Manu Serrano (46' Diego Aguado), V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as, Joan Mart\u00ednez, David Jim\u00e9nez (79' Cristian David) - Jorge Cestero, Thiago Pitarch, Dani Mesonero (46' Pol Fortuny) - \u00c1lvaro Leiva, C\u00e9sar Palacios, Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez\n\nBench: Javi Navarro (GK), Guille S\u00fanico (GK), Mario Rivas, Lamini Fati, \u00c1lvaro Gin\u00e9s, Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga. \n\nUnavailable: Jes\u00fas Fortea (injury), Manuel \u00c1ngel (red card suspension), Roberto Mart\u00edn (injury), Bruno Iglesias (injury), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Rachad Fettal (injury). \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** WDWLW\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 5th | 21pt | 7-0-5 | 15:13\n",

I\u2019m thinking of staying a couple more days to watch the match.\n\nMy question is: if we reach the Supercopa final on the 12th in Jeddah, is there a chance the Levante match gets postponed? Or does La Liga usually keep the schedule as it is? I\u2019m also wondering if the Champions League match vs Ajax on the 20th affects anything.\n\nBasically: should I book my return flight for the 19th to safely catch the match, or is there a real chance that Supercopa/CL scheduling will push the Levante game to another date?\n\nAny advice from people familiar with La Liga scheduling would be really appreciated.",

        "title": "Rodrygo was better than Vini in both the matches Brazil played this international break",
        "content": "I hope Xabi uses Rodrygo more often when Vini isn't performing. He did well this international break. Against Senegal he got 1 assist, 3 shots, 25 accurate passes (86%), 5 duels won, rated 8.0 in [fotmob](https://www.fotmob.com/matches/senegal-vs-brazil/1rwp7u#5017003:tab=stats). Against Tunisia he got 34 accurate passes (97%), 5 duels won, 1 tackle won, rated 7.6. \n\nWe have 2 world class LWs in Vini and Rodrygo. No reason to just let one rot in the bench when there's plenty of opportunity to let both play, especially when Vini is inconsistent in his performances these days. Competition breeds improvement. We have to encourage it.\n\nAlso Gonzalo Garcia scored against Romania. He's a talented striker with good positioning &amp; he's a better aerial threat than most of our players. We should be subbing him in at the 70th minute or so if Mbappe isn't performing, or against low blocks, where we could use a conventional #9 to cross to.",
