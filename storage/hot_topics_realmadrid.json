The win means that Arbeloa's team has reached the round of 16, where the opponent is yet to be determined in a draw\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 16:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee:** Joey Booij (NED) \n\n**Competition:** UEFA Youth League, Round of 32, Single-leg \n\n**Viewing options:** [RMTV/RM Play (potentially VPN needed)](https://www.realmadrid.com/real-madrid-tv), [UEFA.TV](https://uefa.tv) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Juvenil A XI (4-3-3):** \nJavi Navarro (71' \u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez) - V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as \u2018Valde\u2019, Diego Aguado, Mario Rivas, Jes\u00fas Fortea - Cristian David, Roberto Mart\u00edn (78' Lamini Fati) - Hugo de Llanos (78' Jorge Cestero), Pol Fortuny, Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (86' Pol Rivera) - Jacobo Ortega (86' Thiago Pitarch) \n\nBench: Melvin Ukpeigbe, Izan Regueira, Aimar Santiago, Jaime Barroso.\n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n**UYL League Phase stats:** 6th | 12pt | 4-0-2 | 10:5\n",

        "content": "What do you think about Ra\u00fal Asencio\u2019s future at the club?\n\nTbh, I regard him as our best centre-back right now in our squad. He has really stepped up this season, and honestly, I didn\u2019t expect him to become such a crucial player so quickly. With all the injuries we've had, especially to some of our key defenders, Asencio has shown incredible composure and consistency. I still can\u2019t get over his performances against Atl\u00e9tico and City\u2014he looked like he belonged at that level, which is rare for someone so young.\n\nAt just 21, his positioning, awareness, and ability to read the game are beyond his years. He doesn\u2019t panic under pressure, which is something I really appreciate in a centre-back. Plus, his ball-playing ability is solid\u2014he's comfortable carrying the ball forward and starting attacks from the back. I can see why some people are already comparing him to club legends. The \u201cnieto de la Paqui\u201d nickname cracks me up, but it\u2019s a compliment if people are putting him in the same conversation as Ramos.\n\nI genuinely think he should stay in the starting XI even when everyone\u2019s fit. He\u2019s earned it with his performances. His confidence, physicality, and leadership on the pitch are everything we need at the back. If he keeps developing at this pace, we might be looking at our defensive leader for years to come.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Should he be a long-term starter for us, or do we still need to look for reinforcements in the summer?\n\n",

Everyone goes home happy.\"\n\nCredits: M_orale_ \n\nThe hate for Jude Bellingham is so forced. That's why I've stopped engaging in debates where he's discussed as if he's a striker/false 9. Getting into such debates means trying to teach football basics to amateurs who, despite being unaware of the fundamentals, can't resist hating on players for validation from internet trolls. They're neglected individuals in real life seeking attention.\n\nI don't like comparing him to other players. His haters can idolize their supposedly better player, but in doing so, they shamelessly deny reality, which bothers me. Jude's ability to make attacking runs and connect play from both deep and advanced positions is unmatched. How can his haters call him a striker when he has a higher defensive work rate and contributes to goals through passing? Jude is a complete midfielder who excels both offensively and defensively.\n\nI pity his haters, who can't let go of their hate and see him for what he truly is. Anyway, we're blessed to have another young talent on our side.",
