Anyone who doubted him in the first place is a clown, cuz there is no way that you watched this guy play games (not on insta reels) and still end up saying he's a \"waste\". Theirry henry went out on sky sports and said rodrygo is not normal. Jude bellingham himself went out and publicly called rodrygo the most talented player in the squad. \n\nYou can't blame a guy for not scoring in 32 games when he only started in 4 of them. Laliga today is just Barca, Real and 18 other teams that play nothing but low block football. You can't expect rodrygo to get subbed in and score a hattrick everytime. Vini hasn't scored in 12 games so far no one's making that much noise about it.\n\nHe came on against almaty in the 60-70th min and provided 2 assists. Went in to his 2nd ucl start this season against city and he immediately scored, is that a coincidence? I don't think so. The league is a very different story compared to the ucl, especially when its laliga.",

        "title": "Vinicius. A balanced overview of his past, current and future issues",
        "content": "I'll just take some words to talk about Vini. I might leave some questions unanswered and some lines of thought unexplored but here's what I think is a general overview of why he hasn't been playing well and what this means about him as a player, particularly in the future. Is he finished? Let's find out.\n\nForm is confidence, and vini is low on it atm. Take Rodrygo as an example. He scores no goals in 32 games but now has scored back to back. \n\nI'll state my perception of the reason why(he's low on confidence) but keep it brief. I think it's a combination of multiple things that hit its tipping point at the el clasico substitution.\n\nRemember, it's a confidence issue. My feeling is that it revolves around doubts about where he stands with the club and whether or not he's wanted here. There's a couple indicators of this. There's the ballon d'or mbappe signing, the club's unwillingness to commit to a contract with him. People use these things to criticize his mentality but these feelings ARE VALID when we apply context.\n\nVinicius has never been a weak-minded individual. We know that. We should not trivialize the impact these issues have and dismiss them. Ronaldo stated the following as his reason for leaving Madrid.\n\n&gt;I felt it inside the club, especially from the president, that they no longer considered me the same way that they did in the start.\n\nWe know Ronaldo is not a bum by any means, but even he left when he started to feel unloved &amp; unwanted, as he accurately gauged that it would affect his happiness and form.\n\nPlayers are not slaves. Even a good master knows to not ruin his servant's morale. However, we know the club can be ruthless at times. This isn't necessarily a good thing.\n\nRemember that vini was playing really well at the start of the season. He had 5G + 4A(1.08 g+a per 90) and started to get back to his very best. The team also did well in that moment. However, he was unexplainably benched or substituted in scenarios that didn't make sense. It certainly wasn't just mere rotation, neither was it due to form. I remember seeing opinions even then that Madrid were showing a \"power move\" by telling vinicius to either sign the contract or be replaced even without any signing needed. My own opinion was that it was either that or they had promised to give Rodrygo more LW minutes.\n\nThis happened multiple times until Vinicius blew up after the el clasico substitution. His behaviour was wrong and unacceptable, but understandable. We certainly can't pretend it was unwarranted either.\n\nI'm not saying it's the club(or xabi's) fault. Afterall we can't be absolutely sure that they're sending him those subliminal messages. However, for a while it looked like it. By the result, there's valid reasons to doubt if xabi did a good job managing those tensions.\n\nVini's gone out of form since, and though now he appears to have resolved things with Xabi he had already begun on a downward spiral that would always be tricky to recover from. I don't necessarily think they reconciled immediately after El Clasico but they certainly seem to have now.\n\nI think Xabi playing him consistently now is an attempt to fix their broken relationship and by effect his confidence. This is the right step IMO. There's many different reasons to criticize a player for not doing well. But when it's a confidence issue, good managers(or leaders in general) know to not ruin the player's mindset further and to instead show trust in them. Particularly when the player is quality and there are tangible reasons behind their decline in form. It usually is worth it when you believe your chances are better in the long-term with the player. \"**Form is temporary, Class is permanent**\".  \n  \nThe only issue I have is that while showing trust in him is the right move, some might agree that it now feels like an overcompensation and he's playing too many minutes. While xabi is obviously attempting to fix the situation, my personal opinion is that it would have been better if he hadn't contributed to it deteriorating in the first place.\n\nI still think things can turn out fine. Unlike a lot of opinions I've seen claiming that Vini &amp; Mbappe cannot work together(sometimes Jude is thrown in there as well), I think they both can work perfectly and make us clearly the most dangerous front line in Europe. I think losing either of them would be a downgrade. Remember that they each had 49 G+A and 41 G+A last season while being largely out of form for large chunks of it. This is very promising and should be remembered before we make claims that this project won't work. Though either can be replaced, it'd be a big loss if we fumbled either of these players in their prime.\n\nThat being said, neither player is perfect and both still have a lot to learn to play well as a duo. It's largely on Xabi to teach them and help them make that connection. I personally think he has under performed in this regard, although I won't go into details here. He's been trending in the right direction for a couple games now but at a time in the season his tactical requirements for both of them actually made things worse.\n\nThe major question remaining is whether or not the contract situation will get resolved. If it does, it'll be a huge boost for Vinicius. If it doesn't, he'll be forced to leave.",

Lately though, I get irritated the moment I see what some of you are posting, and I honestly start wondering whether some of you are actually Barcelona fans in disguise, trying to create chaos here.\n\nAll I see are absurd questions like: would we be better without Mbapp\u00e9? Or would Kane have been a better option instead? It feels like no matter how well the Frenchman performs, you still find reasons to go after him and criticize him.\n\nLast season you were glorifying Valverde and Jude, and now, almost overnight, you have turned your backs on them and want them replaced or sold. You complain nonstop about the state of the club as if you personally invested money and are now losing it because of the players. I have even seen attacks directed at P\u00e9rez. Fine, maybe we do not agree with every single decision he makes, but can we seriously not appreciate what we have? After P\u00e9rez is gone, you will all regret it, but by then it will be too late.\n\nThis subreddit is dominated by frustration, anger, and regret. Very few people actually stand by the players and the coach. Even fewer show real compassion and genuine love for the biggest football club in the world.\n\nReal Madrid, like any other team, goes through weaker periods. But because many of you are spoiled little bitches who grew up with Champions League trophies, Ballon d\u2019Or winners, and league titles almost every year, the moment things get difficult, instead of acting like real supporters, you rush to Reddit to post all kinds of nonsense.\n\nI genuinely think many of you have forgotten who Real Madrid really are. And that happens because some of you are here only for appearances, or because you support a single player rather than the team as a whole.\n\nIt is time for all of us to show that we are true Real Madrid supporters, because being a true fan of this club is a privilege. Hala Madrid!",

        "content": "I think because of the wide popularity of the club, and being the most successful in Europe especially in the last decade , has attracted fans who are ( glory hunters ), who started supporting the club in its best days, and they aren\u2019t used to RM being a normal team with normal problems?. \n\nThe hate against xabi is just too forced , people can\u2019t handle a manager who suddenly got a room full of egos, superstars, who all wanna play at the same time. And people don\u2019t realize how hard is that, and obviously some people forget that apparently half of the squad is injured and still demanding the SAME results. \n\nThis is a transition stage, after any major success or dominance for a club, things has to change around, and usually the transition stage doesn\u2019t come with the most appealing results, and therefore creating a rage among some fans who can\u2019t handle the fact that losing is part of this game and start booing on the manager to sack him and get zidane. \n\nFYI, i dont think zidane will come, at least in the near future, the guy is dedicated to his NT , And obviously getting him till the end of the season will only mess things more.\n\nWe need a solid foundation, we need to trust the manager this season even if the result aren\u2019t the best. And give him the required time for any manager to deal with those stars, injuries, media.\n\n",

        "content": "Reported by Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz (Tier 2).\n\nP.S. The cited texts are automatically translated. In the title, \"delantero\" should be more accurately \"forward\", not \"striker\".\n\nP.S. There is a similar post of the same source, but it altered the title.\n\nThe reason for Vini's drop in form is \"he hasn't quite reached his full physical potential\".\n\n&gt; The Brazilian, true to form, tried everything [against Man City], but luck wasn't on his side.\n\n&gt; He [Vini] has no doubt about it [regaining his form], nor about the club's constant support. There is no distance whatsoever between the management and the player.\n\nFlurries of weird statements from a journalist. Almost like Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz is a fanboy. But if you imagine these words said in Vini and his entourage's tone, everything makes sense.\n\n&gt; ## Seal the continuity\n\n&gt; The two parties,\u00a0player and president, maintain an excellent relationship and are in constant communication. In these conversations, they have discussed the future and the possibility of\u00a0a new agreement\u00a0that would secure the Brazilian's continued presence at Real Madrid.\n\n&gt; Vinicius has made it clear in recent matches that his understanding with Xabi Alonso is palpable after weeks of tension following the Cl\u00e1sico and the Brazilian's gestures, for which he apologized. Since then, the Brazilian has been untouchable for the coach. His willingness to try is something no one can doubt. He does it time and time again, and the first to know that the striker's streak will change is Xabi Alonso himself.\n\nAnother piece leaked by Vini's agent. The closest thing you get from an apology to Alonso.\n\nSo it looks like Vini's open to renewal again while Alonso remains the coach.\n\n&gt; Since then, the Brazilian has been untouchable for the coach.\n\nCan you believe this sentence is part of evidence that Vini and Alonso have repaired their relationship?",

        "content": "We\u2019ve seen him play on the LW and he favours it. \nBut many times when he does a play Im, he uses the outside of his foot. \n\nNow hear me out in this. He\u2019s very Robben like, one footed deluxe, and when he plays on LW he exposes his right foot to the defender every time, it\u2019s the closest leg to his defender. \n\nPutting him on RW means he has his left body covering the right foot, it\u2019s harder for defenders to take it, prone to give Vini more free kicks. Also, this means \n\n1. He can cross with his stronger foot. \n2. And shoot with his outside foot. \n \n\nHis dribbles are always going in front of the defender, but having the ball closest to the defender, he looses it way to many times, this could give him a bigger advantage.\n\nPutting Mbappe on the left and Rodrygo in the center. Rodrygo can link up very good with Mbappe. Would be a little bit like CR7 and Benzema. \n\nWhat does this Reddit think? ",
