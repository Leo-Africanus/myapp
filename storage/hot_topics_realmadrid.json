        "title": "Analysis of Rodrygo's inconsistency / Rodrygo Rant (LONG POST)",
        "content": "The reason im making this post is because i dont think i've ever seen so many fans defend such an incredibly inconsistent player in all my years of being a Madridista, it's very strange to me.\n\nI think at some point we need to be honest about Rodrygos inconsistency as a player. The ''hes playing out of position on the right wing'' excuse has been around for years, but the reality is hes been at Madrid for five seasons now and has played the majority of his games on that side. If he hasnt adapted by now, i dont know what to tell you. Also, he has the exact same inconsistency problem when he plays on the left, so why are we attributing this to something about what side of the pitch he plays on? \n\nRodrygo has a clear history of disappearing for long stretches. [There are periods where he will go 15 games without a goal](https://i.gyazo.com/4dd70ccb5107d64c10a50975f900abbf.png), which is not acceptable for a starting attacker at Real Madrid, the thing i linked above was from the insane 23/24 season, and [heres something from 22/23](https://i.gyazo.com/890c4767c80f2722fa1b1e9a9f1ae924.png) and [heres something from last season](https://i.gyazo.com/1f882bd04a677989aa19bfb486cf7336.png). I could also show the 21/22 season where he didn't score his first league goal until April, but i dont think Rodrygo was a real starter up until right at the end of that season.\n\nAnd its not just when hes on the right wing in some of those games, he's been played on the left and still failed to deliver. Right now, like i showed you, he hasnt scored a league goal since January. Before that, yes, he had his usual hot streak where he scored and assisted in a few games in a row and showed us how fucking amazing Rodrygo can be. But if you go back before that run, he didnt score between September and December. Its a pattern we've seen season after season short periods of great form, followed by long droughts of not really doing much at all. People want to say he's out of position, sure, but why is it that in the 22/23 season, when Benz was injured a lot, we put Rodrygo in the middle, and his usual hotstreak in ~December-January happened, why did that happen while [he was playing through the middle](https://i.gyazo.com/83df0eb5a5723ae1c682eed202a1a2ef.png)? Wouldn't he be out of position there too? How come he randomly performed, is it because he's inherently an inconsistent player, where his position doesn't really matter too much?\n\nAnd theres this narrative that he works harder defensively than players like Vini or Mbapp\u00e9, which i just dont think is true at all and it unironically triggers the fuck out of me because its an easy excuse people can use that people wont really be able to accurately check if its correct or not, if that makes sense.\n\n [The data](https://i.gyazo.com/8254d0cb337c78242ef22323025ca94d.png) from last season, and from [our most recent CL season](https://gyazo.com/f69cc34cea537f17dbcc4c8ee8745b79), shows that, yes, he might do a bit more than them, but it's by a very small margin. Its not like he's putting a crazy amount of work more every match and exhausting himself, the difference isnt enough to say thats why he's underperforming. That excuse just doesnt hold up, same with the pressing/running thing, [nothing shows that he's some insane presser](https://i.gyazo.com/dfb70fc0cc9ae7c3429a45470283ee48.png), most things are [gonna show that he does run more](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GoUxq_EWQAAZQ9_.jpg:large) but not really [by much at all](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSyO1A5dnMKzSY6JT8iSccyu1tqi9rjLWVGrQ&amp;s), but i guess all the Rodrygo stans are just gonna say that im watching football through stats or whatever else, i dont really know what else to cite when im making a post like this.\n\nIm not saying Rodrygo is a bad player or that i hate him, i think literally every Madrid fan loves the fuck out of him. He's obviously very talented and can be decisive when he's in form. But at some point, you cant keep giving a forward at Real Madrid a free pass for being invisible for months at a time, i dont think i've ever seen another Madrid player get such a free pass like him, i think a ton of this subreddit are too young to know or are just more recent fans, but a player like Benzema got fucking grilled like crazy in both the 16/17 season and the 17/18 season for being inconsistent, literally on of our most upvoted posts during those years was [''1 upvote = 1 apology to Benzema''](https://www.reddit.com/r/realmadrid/comments/6afgnd/1_upvote1_apology_to_benzema) because people were endlessly shitting on him, myself included in 2018. It feels like a lot of people are just so in love with Rodrygo because of stuff like the Chelsea and City goals, plus the CDR final goals, i will forever love Rodrygo for those too, but im not gonna be blinded by my love for him.\n\nSo when people say stuff about how Rodrygo should start on the left over Vini..... Why exactly? I dont know in what situation you'd ever take a gamble on Rodrygo somehow becoming a consistent player when he gets to play on the left, and also matching/being better than Vini, who for 4 seasons straight has put up 40+g/a, even in his last season, which was a bad one, and i think has broken the record for most G/A in the CL knockout stages, showing that he's a big game player. Like in what world do you ever say ''Hey Vini, i know you were consistently the best LW in the world for 4 years straight, but since you didn't perform well in the last half of the season, we're gonna bench you for the guy who guy who hasn't performed consistently in either of the 3 attacking positions, because apparently he runs more than you, sorry king''. Like you guys are either blinded by your love for Rodrygo, which i am guilty of too in the past, or you're just delusional. This guy is not good enough of a player to force us into  4-3-3, our best formation, as we saw in our most recent double and in a lot of the games last season when Carlo finally benched Rodrygo, is a 4-3-1-2, with Vini and Kylian up top with Jude/Arda behind them, i dont see what Rodrygo does that warrants us changing our entire formation just to fit him in.",

        "content": "MOST important point before saying anything, he was close to signing with PSG and Xabi calling him and telling him about his role in the team gave him the confidence to sign. I know we are his dream club but PSG wanted him badly. So Xabi, rates him very highly.\n\nI've been looking at alot of his videos and saw some of the replays of the games where he performed well. Out of all the players we got from SA in the recent years, he is clearly the most ready to get minutes. The other's were not ready and simply prospects but this guy just needs to adapt to the team and league.\n\nSimilar to Yamal. Franco is an agile dribbler who doesnt reply on his physicality like Vini to dribble past people. He also is amazing at link ups and through balls. I noticed alot of times his playmaking was too good for River plate players, where he would do an amazing pass but his teamamtes would not be able to predict the pass and go into space.\n\nWith players like Mbappe, Vini...etc. he wont have this problem.\n\nOut of Arda and Franco. I can see one of them become a CM. Or even both. They are just too good to not play together",

        "content": "Our record over the last 2 seasons where vini doesn't play and Rodrygo does is 17-2-2 . Over those games, Rodrygo recorded 12 goals and 5 assists at LW . If you ask me, that's not bad . It's so easy for people to hate on Rodrygo for playing out of position and putting up bad numbers, but  if the roles were reverse and Rodrygo was in Vini's shoes , we would be having the same conversation about Vini . Vini's never had to play out of position or compromise as much as Rodrygo has since Carlo joined and that led to him developing bad habits. \n\nThis isn't a post of me trying to hate Vini. Both players have very different qualities in terms of play style but are equally effective on the LW . This is a team sport. This sub should be thinking who would be the better RW and I think that would be Vini . Rodrygo's link-up play (IMO)  is better than Vini's , he has great chemistry with the fullbacks and utilizes overlaps better and his chemistry with Mbapp\u00e9 is better. However, vini is more relentless, explosive and more willing to take players on and can beat the opponent to the byline to create better chances. He also likes to trivela a lot . All of those qualities make him to be a much better RW than Rodrygo l. If vini puts up better stats than Rodrygo does (which I believe he would), then that's a  positive and improves the team . Even if Xabi doesn't want to play Rodrygo , Mbapp\u00e9 would also love that LW spot and play Garcia  at striker . I hope Xabi tries this early in the season because I think this will unlock our offense, but at the end of the day, I trust Xabi's judgment and won't be too overcritical .",
