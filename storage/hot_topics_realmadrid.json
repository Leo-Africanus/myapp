        "content": "#FT: JUVENIL A 1:0 JUVENTUS U19\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#UEFA YOUTH LEAGUE \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:**\n\n1:0 Liberto Navascu\u00e9s 13'\n\nRed card: Antonio Merola (Juventus) 86'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - kickoff, vamos! \n\n9' - mediocre shot by Izan from the edge of the box, it gets blocked and lands right in front of Y\u00e1\u00f1ez in the box, who needs to score from a good position, but his shot is weak and the keeper can parry it away \n\n\u26bd 13' - GOLLL DEL JUVENIL A - Corner from the left, the ball bounces off of a Juve player and lands in front of Liberto, who acts quickly and pokes it past the keeper for an early lead! \n\n24' - simple play by Juvenil A, Barroso gets the ball with his back turned to goal and plays through Fortea - he is through on goal all by himself, but doesn't have the pace to pull through and the defender catches up on him before he can shoot \n\n36' - corner taken short, Y\u00e1\u00f1ez puts in the cross onto Rivas' head, and his header hits the bar! Then, the ball comes to Izan at the edge of the box, who curls a shot nicely to the top left corner, but the keeper anticipates well and catches it \n\n40' - incredible clearance on the line by Izan - nice cross towards the far post, where the Juve player is ready to tap it over the line, but Izan, while falling, somehow manages to put his foot between the ball and the goal and blocks it for a corner\n\n45'+1 - huge chance for Carlos D\u00edez after a failed offside trap by Juve, but he falls over as he shoots and the ball rolls harmlessly wide \n\nHT - very dominant first half by our U19s, who had Juventus pinned to their box throughout the majority of the half. The first goal came rather quickly compared to what we are used to in UYL, but since then the team had a significant number of opportunities to increase the lead that they sadly didn't take. Apart from a single short phase around minute 40, Juventus were not able to maintain some possession in our half\n\n46' - 2nd half underway \n\n59' - Juvenil A now dominating even harder, but not able to find the second goal so far. After a great team play, Liberto's cross finds the head of Barroso, but his header goes just over the bar, the keeper would've been left without a chance\n\n\ud83d\udd04 60' - first sub, Adri P\u00e9rez on for Y\u00e1\u00f1ez\n\n\ud83d\udd04 66' - Beto comes on for Pol Dur\u00e1n \n\n\ud83d\udd04 67' - and Gabri Valero comes on for Liberto, who can't continue with a shoulder injury after a dirty and unnecessary shoulder barge by a Juve player\n\n\ud83d\udd04 81' - Jacobo and Gasc\u00f3n come on for Barroso and Carlos D\u00edez \n\n85' - Juve's U19s are a really dirty team, wow... All they do is foul in this match \n\n\ud83d\udfe5 87' - red card for Juve's Merola for hitting Fortea in the face on the ground. Disgraceful team with disgraceful players \n\nFT - an end to a game in which the team should've put this match to bed way earlier, wasting countless long phases of possession and counter attacks at the end without finally scoring the 2-0. Still, the 1-0 was enough because Juve failed to create a single chance in the second half, being more focused on kicking and punching the shit out of our players, which sadly led to an injury to Liberto Navascu\u00e9s, who has his shoulder wrapped and immobilised with what could be a dislocation. Julian L\u00f3pez de Lerma's team is still flawless in UYL with 3/3 wins and also in all competitions with 8/8 wins this season, they are well on track to qualifying for the knockout rounds, currently sitting 5th in the table\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 16:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee:** \u0141ukasz Ku\u017ama (POL) \n\n**Competition:** UEFA Youth League, League Phase, Matchday 3\n\n**Viewing options:** [RMTV/RM PLAY](https://play.realmadrid.com/home)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Juvenil A XI (4-4-3):** Javi Navarro - \u00c1lvaro Lezcano, Ariel Nkoghe, Mario Rivas, Jes\u00fas Fortea - Izan Regueira, Carlos D\u00edez (81' Ignacio Gasc\u00f3n), Pol Dur\u00e1n (66' Diego Mart\u00ednez 'Beto') - Liberto Navascu\u00e9s (67' Gabri Valero), Jaime Barroso (81' Jacobo Ortega), Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (60' Adri P\u00e9rez)\n\nBench: \u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez (GK), Javi Bail\u00f3n, Joan Mart\u00ednez, Bruno Galassi. \n\nCoach: Juli\u00e1n L\u00f3pez de Lerma\n",

        "title": "[TheAthletic] Real Madrid\u2019s mentality worries put extra pressure on Xabi Alonso",
        "content": "After Real Madrid\u2019s 5-2 defeat by Atletico Madrid back in September, stern words were shared among the first-team group.\n\nSources who witnessed this, speaking anonymously to protect their position like others consulted for this article, say there was a frank exchange between players, with particular criticism aimed at junior members of the squad over their attitude and application in the build-up.\n\nIt was the first major test of this new squad, and they badly failed it.\n\nSince then, Madrid have managed to get things back on track. They are two points clear of Barcelona in La Liga. They have registered two wins from two in the Champions League so far. But, in truth, they haven\u2019t been significantly tested.\n\nFor that reason there is concern that, as Xabi Alonso\u2019s side enters a difficult run that includes games against Juventus, Barcelona and Liverpool over the next two weeks, issues over leadership and the team\u2019s mentality may surface again, with another mis-step likely to add significant pressure on the manager.\n\nOne club source likened the situation around Alonso right now to a player in danger of receiving a yellow card, with the match only just having started.\n\nTo understand why Madrid have these concerns, we need to look back a little.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2024, Madrid celebrated six Champions League titles, an unprecedented number that leaves their total number of European Cup wins at 15. The closest team to them, Milan, have won it seven times.\n\nMadrid\u2019s squad did not stay the same over that decade, far from it. Key players came and went, managers were hired and fired. But there was still a strong sense of continuity: Toni Kroos and Lucas Vazquez won five of those six titles. Luka Modric, Dani Carvajal and Nacho were there for each one.\n\nCarvajal, 33, is the only of that group still at Madrid today. He is the club\u2019s current longest-serving player, and therefore its captain (as is policy at the Santiago Bernabeu). Thibaut Courtois is the same age but he has not been at Madrid as long \u2014 Federico Valverde, 27, is vice-captain.\n\nAfter that Champions League title in 2024, three influential senior players left. Kroos retired. Nacho joined Al Qadsiah in Saudi Arabia. Joselu \u2014 who was only at Madrid a year but was still a big voice in the dressing room \u2014 left for Al Gharafa in Qatar.\n\nLast summer, two more departed: Modric is now at Milan and Vazquez is with Bayer Leverkusen in Germany.\n\nThe presence of senior players was always an important factor for Carlo Ancelotti during his second spell at the club from 2021 to 2025, a period in which they won the Champions League twice, as well as two La Liga titles and the Spanish Cup.\n\nAt Madrid, there is an unwritten rule that players over the age of 30 are only offered one-season contract extensions, with these proposals often only coming close to the end of the campaign.\n\nWhenever the club asked Ancelotti for his opinion on these renewals, the Italian was always in favour of keeping the veterans. It was a footballing issue first and foremost, but also an environmental one.\n\nTowards the end of the 2023-2024 season, a source involved in the day-to-day running of Real Madrid considered it \u201cessential\u201d that at least one of Modric (who ended up renewing) and Kroos (who decided to retire) stayed. This year, the situation was described in the same way when there were doubts about the continuity of Modric again and it looked like Vazquez might depart.\n\n\u201cIf they both leave this is going to be very difficult,\u201d the source said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a technical issue, but rather one of atmosphere. If Carvajal is left alone, he\u2019ll explode within a month.\u201d\n\nNeither Modric nor Vazquez were renewed, despite concerns developing over the dressing room atmosphere last term, and that apparent worry over Carvajal.\n\nOver 2024-25, Madrid went from having (according to staff sources at the time) \u201cthe best dressing room\u201d in the previous season to one with more ego and friction. The fact the campaign ended without a trophy did not help.\n\nIt got to the point that one first-team player told The Athletic in May: \u201cLet\u2019s see if Xabi dares to enter this madhouse.\u201d\n\nHe did indeed. Alonso\u2019s arrival was seen by Madrid not only as a way to improve the team\u2019s play and results, but also to improve the day-to-day functioning of the dressing room.\n\nSources familiar with the situation say that Alonso found \u201ca dressing room with many bad habits\u201d. The Basque coach has been working on creating a new culture, asking for key elements such as punctuality, and high intensity in training sessions.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve gone from having a coach who was hardly involved in training sessions (Ancelotti) to one who seems like just another player,\u201d a person close to a first-team player said.\n\nMadrid\u2019s squad still has its senior figures, but there is definitely a sense that they do not possess as many leaders as they once did.\n\nThis summer, along with new manager Alonso came five reinforcements. Academy striker Gonzalo Garcia was promoted to the first team, Dean Huijsen joined from Bournemouth, Trent Alexander-Arnold from Liverpool, Franco Mastantuono from River Plate and Alvaro Carreras from Benfica. The average age of these signings was under 22.\n\nHuijsen, although he started positively, has made several much-commented mistakes in recent weeks. Sources say he has been specifically asked to improve his concentration in order to develop his great potential.\n\nMeanwhile, even though Alexander-Arnold was, at 27, the most experienced of those summer arrivals, he is described around the club as someone who will need more time to adapt, as he still seems shy.\n\nThis term, Kylian Mbappe is one of the players who has stepped up, although he is described more as a leader in matches than on a day-to-day basis, where he does not reach the level of Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s well-documented ego and hunger.\n\nDespite the noise that has surrounded Valverde in recent weeks, the Uruguayan is noted as a leader through the daily example of his work ethic, while Aurelien Tchouameni, signed in 2022, is also seen as heading in the right direction.\n\nHowever, there are others who need to fill the void left by the departed veterans, such as Jude Bellingham.\n\nAlonso and his staff feel that now is the best time to pull together, to reap the rewards of all their hard work and changes. They point out that they have only made one mistake, against Atletico, but that it caused such a stir that it brought back memories of the heavy defeat by Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup semi-final in July (which Madrid lost 4-0).\n\nAnother mis-step in the big games ahead would call into question the credibility of the project, complicate the run-up to Christmas, and leave Madrid with real pressure to win the Spanish Super Cup in January, where they face Atletico in the semi-finals with Athletic Club and Barcelona to contest the other.\n\nFirst up it\u2019s Juve in the Champions League, followed by the small matter of El Clasico on Sunday.",

Enjoy our team... Enjoy the moment... It will never come back.\n\nHala Madrid!",

When conflicts arise such as Sunday vs Getafe, some say they want a captain who will get down and gritty to defend or speak up for his teammates. Say like a Ramos archetype. On that same topic, some might want the opposite out of a captain. Someone who sets the example of focusing purely on football and not drama. How do you guys feel?",

The Viagogo prices are sadly beyond my budget \u2014 are there any safer or more affordable alternatives?)\n\nThank you so much, and Hala Madrid!",
