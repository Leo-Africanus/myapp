Turns out, there was no penalty, my love score app showed the goal ruled out as a missed penalty mistakenly\n\n12' - a Ferrol player is injured but our players refuse to kick the ball out. When the game is stopped, their players go after ours and start a fight, the referee have 2 yellow cards, but I wouldn't be surprised if Arbeloa asks for another review for a red card\n\n15' - despite the review showing a CLEAR elbow into the face of Joan, the referee decides it's no red card, even after he gets shown the incident on the screen - I am speechless at this point\n\n38' - Castilla now controlling the match to their liking and working hard for the first goal, Ferrol busy defending\n\n\u26bd 45'+5 - Goal for Ferrol, Cristian David defends Pascu so badly that he can take a shot directly from the corner kick, he hits it nicely with the inside of the foot, leaving Fran without a chance \n\nHT - well, that's one way to throw a half into the gutter where you controlled a big part of the match - the team had lots of dangerous possession but failed to generate much actual danger, and Ferrol punish them late on\n\n46' - 2nd half underway, let's turn this around and prevent the negative trend\n\n\ud83d\udd04 58' - Triple sub by Arbeloa - Fortea, Palacios and Y\u00e1\u00f1ez for David, Pol Fortuny and Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga\n\n\ud83d\udd04 69' - Roberto Mart\u00edn comes on for Bruno Iglesias\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 17:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Campo 7, Ciudad Real Madrid, Madrid\n\n**Referee**:  \n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 1, Matchday 2\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[LaLiga+](https://www.laligaplus.laliga.com/) (subscription - 14.99\u20ac/month)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (5-2-3): Fran Gonz\u00e1lez - Diego Aguado, Lamini Fati, Joan Mart\u00ednez, David Jim\u00e9nez (58' Jes\u00fas Fortea) - Cristian David, Thiago Pitarch, Manuel \u00c1ngel - Bruno Iglesias (69' Roberto Mart\u00edn), Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga (58' Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez), Pol Fortuny (58' C\u00e9sar Palacios) \n\nBench: Guille S\u00fanico (GK), Sergio Mestre (GK), V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as, Mario Rivas, Manu Serrano, Gabri Castrelo, Jacobo Ortega.\n\nUnavailable: Jorge Cestero (suspended), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Rachad Fettal (injury). \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** WWL\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 15th | 3pt | 1-0-1 | 2:2\n",

        "content": "\u26aa[\ud83c\udf00](https://emojipedia.org/cyclone) Madrid scrape a 2\u20131 win over Marseille at the Bernab\u00e9u!\n\nA tense night saw two penalties decide the scoreline and Carvajal sent off, but the result adds another historic mark: 200 wins in the UCL, first team ever to do it. A French team is still yet to win here too. Mbapp\u00e9 also hit 50 goals for us as well.\n\nThe first half was enjoyable, fluid, and electric; the second half turned into a grind, exposing defensive transitions that need sharpening and a finishing touch that could have made it more comfortable. Worried a little about Fede and Vini. Hopefully they can bounce back before things get tough later in the season.\n\nWe\u2019ve broken down every performance, player by player.\n\nWhere do you think the team needs to improve the most?\n\n\\- MadridNoir \ud83e\udd0d\ud83d\udc51",

I see Arda doing that, but with Fede, he legit seems stuck in the double pivot with Tchouameni or even being the one staying deeper. Is xabi trying to give Fede less of a workload, or something? It just feels like a weird way to use Fede, especially when we know he's a good goal scorer ",
