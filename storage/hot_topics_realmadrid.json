        "content": "I think these statements are all that's needed to be said on the topic. I'm posting this as an answer to everyone who thinks that the youngsters have been done wrong etc. (including myself at some points)\n\n**The question**: You said that G\u00fcler was fine and ready to play the other day, but how are you handling the situation with such a young player, I'd like to know that. Do you expect more patience and work from him, or does the player come to your office himself to request advice?\n\n**Ancelotti**: All the players can come and talk to me. I speak to him, Endrick and all of the young players on a daily basis. I've read that there is an issue with G\u00fcler? But it hasn't got here yet. He's working hard and wants to play, like everyone else, but it's a process for him and for all the young players like we did with Rodrygo, Valverde and Vini Jr. He needs time to join the best squad in the world because the players are very good and the competition is fierce. Everyone understands that and if they don't, they should.\n\nI spend every day with the young players and I don't want to see players who are happy when they're not playing. I want players who work hard, who learn and who want to play. I think that's normal, but this is a small part of their time. They spend much more time with other people and I don't know if these other people have the same idea and are thinking the same way that I do about them: that they improve and that they can soon play for Real Madrid. This is a lack of communication.",

They have to be a world beaters almost without flaws, like Jude Bellingham, to start in this team. \n\nWhat kind of moron you have to be to bitch about the minutes of 19 y.o. kid when he decided to join the biggest club itw packed with stars, and then said he didn't want a loan? On top of that, when he did have a chance in a tough match vs Liverpool he was poor. \n\nJust calm the fuck down, if he works hard he could be very important player at RM, but nothig is given for free here. And it's not Ancelotti's characteristic, it was the same with Zidane and will be the same with every other manager. Some stans are just mad that their boy isn't a hybrid of Messi and Zidane like they wanted us to believe.",
