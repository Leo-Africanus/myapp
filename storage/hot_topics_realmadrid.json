Arda Guler has been trash all season and we saw how Endrick is not yet a starter-level player. Vinicius and Mbapp\u00e9 are two of the best players in the world, we need to relax and stop changing our opinions every single week. Y'all only remember the good moments and forget that Ronaldo, Bale, Benzema etc all had bad games at times. So stop getting mad at our two best players, and wait until Vini and Mbappe start to cook.",

If he trains his left foot consistently, he could even develop into an ambipedal player, which would elevate his technical ability to absurd levels.\n\nThat is, of course, if he feels the need to. Beginning to train your weak foot well into your career can be an exhausting process and it could take years for him to feel comfortable enough to just control the ball with his left in a real game. However, given that he (hopefully) stays with us for many years playing on the right, he's gonna be put in more and more situations where he NEEDS to use it like he did tonight.\n\nNaturally, he should get better with time, but I'd love to one day see him fire a rocket into the net with his left. It's practically a tradition for our number 11s.",

I know he is more of an attacker, but Camavinga isn't cutting it atm and Modric is old. Ancelotti is known for making players work in different position so he could do it with Brahim too? ",
