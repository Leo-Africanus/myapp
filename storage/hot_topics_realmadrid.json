They and the player\u2019s representatives reached an understanding in February over what the terms might be of any potential transfer, were he to have signed for them for a fee last summer or as a free agent with a signing-on bonus this coming summer.\n\nBut Madrid then cooled on the idea and only resumed contact with Davies\u2019 camp after they won the Champions League final against Borussia Dortmund in June. That, coupled with Madrid not making a formal offer to Bayern in the summer, left Davies in doubt about whether the Spanish club really wanted him. There have since been talks between Madrid and the left-back\u2019s agent this season, but nothing concrete, despite some reports to the contrary in Spain",
