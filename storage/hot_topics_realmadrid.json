Then Modri\u0107 went towards Vin\u00edcius and asked him to return and support the team defensively.\n\nVin\u00edcius did not like that and responded to Modri\u0107, who in turn raised his voice and scolded him publicly. Alfredi also did not like Vin\u00edcius's reaction and asked him to respect Modri\u0107. \n\nModri\u0107 was annoyed with Vin\u00edcius more than once for not cooperating with the group defensively. He spoke to him twice and asked him to return, but the Brazilian ignored him. The third time, Modri\u0107 spoke to him and asked him the same thing. Vin\u00edcius responded with a gesture with open hands as if to say, \"What do you want from me?\" Modri\u0107 shouted at him, \"Go to hell.\"\n\nCadena Ser confirmed that these shots did not appear in the TV broadcast. Vinicius left the field immediately after the referee's whistle and did not celebrate with his teammates.\n",

When I woke up, I had no idea what happened and saw Cristiano Ronaldo stayed there all night with my wife and kids\u201d",
        "content": "Full transcript:\n\nYour leave from Madrid?\n\nThat's how it is, I talked to him a lot and he told me to stay at Real Madrid. But I think my time at the club had already arrived, because it was 10 years of great demand, where I gave up a lot of time. I tried to explain to him that I could no longer be there because of the difficulties I was having at that time and he said: \"If it's for the money, man, I'll give up my money to give it to you!\". And I said no: \"Thank God it's not for that, it's for other issues\". I also wanted to feel football again, and that's it, I chose to go to Turkey.\n\nThere were eight seasons in common in Madrid. There are surely good stories to remember and some less good ones too. Eight seasons is a lot...\n\nLook, I have a moment with Cris that will never leave my memory. Despite having lost my memory, I lost a piece of this game. It was in the first game of the championship against Valencia. I received a blow from Iker [Casillas], opened my head and went to the hospital. I still entered the game [before that]. There were five minutes left, I entered after the break and, that's it, from there I don't remember anything else.\n\nI remember that when I woke up the next day at the hospital, I was still with Real Madrid equipment tied to the bed. Then, I was going to ask my family what had happened, my wife, who was five days away from having my eldest daughter, who is Angeli, and in the news I see that Cris had been there in the hospital!\n\nAnd you didn't even give it for him?\nAnd I didn't even notise him! And then, of course, my mother was there, also worried because she had come to see the birth of my daughter, my mother and my father. Cris was there practically all night with me, with my family members. Not with me, with my family, because I was in the room. But he was there, giving strength and some comments he made only demonstrate the affection we have for each other.\n\n\nDid you have an ordinary social life in Madrid? Have you ever cooked for him or did he cook?\n\n[laughs] Not that! It was easier for me to go to his house, because he invited me a lot. We went to his house, we had dinner at his house, or sometimes we went out for dinner and then we came home [laughs].\n",

He has TONS of RM jerseys, but none of them are original. I went to an Adidas showroom yday and saw the official jersey. I can afford it, so that's not an issue, but I'm unsure if it's worth it because before when I asked him why he never bought an original jersey, he said he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the price. And that he can get exact looking replicas for way lesser price. But I also feel if he had been making more money - he's studying, doing masters rn - he would have invested in at least one original jersey. (That's just me thinking, idk)\n\nFor those who own original jerseys or collect football merch, what do you think? Would an official jersey make a good gift or should I just get him something else instead.\n",

        "title": "People never really think things through when asking why the club does not make moves in the Winter transfer",
        "content": "I'm gonna try to make this as simple as possible by changing the perspective one second and considering the combinations between these 2 elements :\n\n\\- Title contender vs Mid Table (or below) teams\n\n\\- Key starters vs bench (or rotation) players\n\n**Scenario 1:  We want to loan a key starter from a title contender team**\n\nNow why dafuq would any team in their right mind give up any key player while playing for trophies. That's never gonna happen. So we can already forget that.\n\n**Scenario 2:  We want to loan a bench player from a title contender team**\n\nOkay, yes these may be players that they can dispose of, but why would they want to help you strengthen your squad if they're likely competing against you (domestically or continentally).\n\n**Scenario 3:  We want to loan a key starter from a mid table team**\n\nAlso not gonna happen. Think about it, why would I loan you a guy who's having a stellar season for me and is helping my club finish higher in the league tables than usual (thus securing more revenue) right in the middle of the season ? Also, this player who's an X-factor for me, probably will get less minutes at your club (Real Madrid), which will kill his momentum and hype. So once he gets back from loan, his resell value will have taken a massive hit.\n\n*Imagine if Jovic went on loan in January 6 months before we bought him. He would have been exposed, and no way any sane club would pay the 80M we paid.*\n\nSo no, again, these types of players don't get loaned. If you want them, you're gonna pay a nice premium like City just did for Marmoush, cause Frankfurt's performance won't be the same going forward and they made sure City paid upfront for the upcoming $$ losses.\n\n**Scenario 4:  We want to loan a bench player from a mid table team**\n\nNow why the hell would we do that. Unless we want to end up with Mariano and Vallejo 2.0.\n\n\n\nSo you see where I'm trying to go here. \n\nHowever, there is one final scenario not mentioned, but the stars have to align.\n\n**Scenario 5:  A key starter from a title contender team falling off with the current coach and forces a move**\n\nThis is the only time when a club like Real Madrid could actually consider a loan move. Cause the player in cases like this did not become shit, he just did not fit the manager's plans/system anymore. But the player is still serviceable. And in situations like this, the loan actually makes everyone happy. The manager no longer has locker room drama, the players gets playtime, the new club gets a player who can help them. And bonus, once the players comes back from loan, his value didn't tank, cause he actually showed his quality at the club he was loaned to, unlike if he had stayed at his original club and rot on the bench. But again, the stars have to align for such players to be available when you need them.\n\nUltimately, the football world is not just Real Madrid being the main protagonist and everyone else being some retarded NPC. Teams have ambitions too. It does not have to be as high as ours, but they  have goals nonetheless, and they won't shoot themselves in the foot cause Real Madrid came knocking on the door, regardless of their status. So if you really want their player that bad, you gonna have to pay up. Which won't happen since Flo is not an idiot and we're not backed by PL and oil money.",

Or Theo from AC Milan. Alvaro from Benfica could be a cheap option but I don\u2019t see him being a long term starter. I can\u2019t lie Gvardiol would also be sick but is probably unrealistic.\n\nPersonally Gutierrez would be my pick but what are your thoughts ",
