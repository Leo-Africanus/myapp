I hope they don\u2019t play the reverse uno card on us. \n\nHonestly, what is Carlo thinking about by playing with Vazquez and Tchouameni?! Fede can play for Vazquez, I know we loose him in the middle but we can play with Modric who has been doing great in the last games (I can\u2019t believe he is still playing that good) Ceballos and Bellingham. Asencio needs to play in any position either central back or in the right. \nOur attack is finally tuned in, either with Rodrygo or Vinicius in the left. Rodrygo has been on fire!",
