        "title": "Biggest fumble of the decade to not get Kane or Haaland instead of Mbappe. Flo has a lot to answer for only choosing Mbappe.",
        "content": "The situation I am describing highlights one of the potential pitfalls of investing heavily in a single player like Mbapp\u00e9. While his talent is undeniable, football is a team sport, and a player\u2019s work ethic and tactical fit often matter as much as their individual brilliance. If Mbapp\u00e9 isn\u2019t pulling his weight defensively or contributing to the team\u2019s pressing game, it puts a massive burden on his teammates, especially in high-stakes matches where defensive organization is critical.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that his performances are suffering from a lack of adaptation to the team\u2019s tactical setup. Some players thrive when their team is built around them, but others struggle when they\u2019re required to fit into a pre-existing system. If Mbapp\u00e9 isn\u2019t delivering consistently\u2014whether due to effort, a mismatch in tactical expectations, or issues with team chemistry\u2014it makes the heavy investment in him seem less justifiable, especially if the club sacrificed depth or other key areas to fund his arrival.\n\nAs for his lack of clinical finishing, that\u2019s a concern for any top-tier striker. It\u2019s not just about the goals he scores but also the chances he creates or misses that could turn the tide of a game. Players like Erling Haaland and Robert Lewandowski, for example, are often praised for their ability to stay involved in the game even when their team struggles to dominate. Mbapp\u00e9, on the other hand, risks falling into the trap of becoming a passenger when things aren\u2019t going well.\n\nIt\u2019s still early, as I mentioned, and players do need time to settle into new clubs and systems. However, fans and analysts will naturally expect a player of Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s caliber and cost to make an immediate and consistent impact. If he continues to struggle, the pressure will only intensify, and the decision to build a team around him might start to look like a gamble that didn\u2019t pay off.",

Since his appointment, Carlo has developed Vini into the best player in the world and turned Bellingham into a complete midfielder. Last season, we won the Champions League and La Liga, but the squad planning has been far from ideal.\n\nThere was no proper replacement for Nacho, no real replacement for Joselu, and, most importantly, no replacement for Kroos. Let\u2019s face it: you\u2019re never going to find another Kroos. But hey, at least Papa Perez finally got the player he\u2019s been twerking for seven years.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the noise about Arda G\u00fcler needing to start every game. He\u2019s talented, sure, but he\u2019s not ready to consistently play in Real Madrid\u2019s starting XI. The competition is just too tough, and right now, he isn\u2019t good enough to start the majority of games.\n\nAs for Mbapp\u00e9, Carlo is doing his best to build a balanced team around him. Let\u2019s be real\u2014Carlo probably didn\u2019t even want him. A player like Mbapp\u00e9 shifts the dynamics entirely, and it\u2019s going to take time to make it work.\n\nBringing in a new coach won\u2019t solve anything. The solution is having faith in Carlo and let him cook. Sign some proper backups and players who Carlo need not Perez, his ego is keeping us from getting Ramos. ",

        "title": "Not so fun fact: This is the first time Real Madrid losses 3 matches in the Group Stage (now League Phase) of the Champions League",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/avg5ig1c0j3e1.png?width=1408&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2b8009d55d4def47307b003c6b6f3b0bacbd9c3\n\nWhile watching the game a thought came to my mind \"Wait if we lose, this will be our 3rd loss. That feels like a lot\". \n\n  \nSo i checked all the losses of the team since the **season 1992-1993** (the season the competition took the Champions League name) and yeah, we **never** had **3 losses** in the **group stages**.  \nI know that this year doesn't count as \"Group Stage\" so an alternative title is **\"Real Madrid never had 3 losses in the first 6 Champions League matches.\"**   \nIt makes me feel kinda weird, but on the other hand it's a cool statistic to remind yourself how good we are. \n\nAs for the **4 years we didn't qualify**, don't feel so bad. It happened in the **90s** (1996-1997, 1994-1995, 1993-1994, 1992-1993) and **2/4** we finished **second** in the league with 1 point difference from Barcelona, that's why we didn't qualify (back then only the champions were participating in **\"THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE\"**, makes sense lol) and the other 2 we finished 4th and 6th. \n\nAlso another fun fact is that **from** the season **2010-2011** **until** the season **2016-2017** we only had **1 loss**. It's kinda crazy to think that for **7 seasons in a row** (in **46 games**) we only had **1 loss** and if you count the **2017-2018** season, then it's **2 losses** in **8 sequential seasons**. And lastly if you count the **2009-2010 season** we had **3 losses** in **9 sequential seasons**. \n\nSo if you feel bad about today, remember that in 5 games we have as many losses as we've had in 9 years and 54 games. \n\nThe stats in detail are (i list the seasons using the year of their final):   \n**0 losses:** 2024, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2012, 2011, 2004 **(8)**  \n**1 loss:** 2023, 2022, 2020, 2018, 2013, 2010, 2008, 2007, 2003, 2002, 2001, 2000, 2005, 1996, 1998 **(15)**  \n**2 losses:** 2021, 2019, 2009, 2006, 1999 **(5)**  \n**DQ:** 1997, 1995, 1994, 1993 **(4)** \n\n",
