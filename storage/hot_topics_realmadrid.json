        "title": "Who is a \u201cgreater\u201d Real Madrid legend: Lucas or Nacho?",
        "content": "I was bored the other day and this question came to mind and I thought it\u2019d be a fun discussion. In my opinion, they are 100% both legends but I think Nacho is higher up on the list. I love Lucas and I even have a 21/22 kit with his name on the back so this is no disrespect to him but I think Nacho is a \u201cgreater\u201d club legend.\n\nIn a hypothetical list named \u201cReal Madrid Legends\u201d, who would you say is higher up on that list \u2014 Lucas or Nacho?\n\nHere are some arguments for both their cases:\n\n* **Nacho** has been a more staple name in our core XI than Lucas over the years, having started 259 matches for the club compared to the 178\\* of Lucas\u2019 (\\*as of 27/01/2025). Although it\u2019s partially because Nacho has had 3 more seasons than Lucas, that fact actually strengthens Nacho\u2019s case for club legend as longevity is surely a huge factor.\n* **Lucas** played the most matches for Real Madrid during Zidane\u2019s three-peat era (from the moment Zidane replaced Ben\u00edtez to the moment he resigned in May 2018). Yes, you heard that right \u2014 in the greatest 2.5 year period of Real Madrid\u2019s (at least modern) history, the player who featured the most across all competitions for the club wasn\u2019t Ronaldo, wasn\u2019t Ramos, wasn\u2019t Modri\u0107, but Lucas V\u00e1zquez Iglesias. Albeit most were sub appearances, it\u2019s still a crazy stat. I\u2019m not suggesting he was the reason we threepeated the UCL, but using him that much had to have been crucial in allowing our best attackers to stay fit for the important matches.\n* **Nacho** became club captain \u2014 arguably the highest privilege a Real Madrid player can achieve, which is a title he shares with only 36 other people in history (that\u2019s less than there\u2019s been U.S. presidents). On the other hand, Lucas is unlikely to join that prestigious club as Carvajal is ahead of him in the pecking order and is younger, although that depends on the state of the latter\u2019s recovery from his ACL injury.\n* **Lucas** has arguably been involved in more \u201ciconic\u201d moments than Nacho in a Real Madrid kit, such as the time he spun the ball on his finger before taking and scoring the first penalty in the 2016 UCL final shoot-out against Atleti, ~~the time he supplied the cross to Ronaldo\u2019s bicycle kick goal against Juventus,~~ and when he juggled the ball on the way to the penalty spot against Man City in the 2024 UCL semi-final shoot-out to put us ahead 1-2.\n\nIf you don\u2019t consider either of them club legends, I\u2019d call you crazy but that\u2019s your opinion. However, you can still discuss who\u2019s closer to achieving legend status even if that\u2019s your position. The obvious elephant in the room is that Lucas is still at the club and still has more story to write in white while Nacho\u2019s is almost definitely already set in stone.\n\nSo what do you think?",
