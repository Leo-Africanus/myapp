        "content": "Comprar boletos es una pesadilla para turistas que son no socios, me imagino que es igual para gente que vive en Madrid.\n\nMi pregunta es, hay alg\u00fan grupo que compra/venta de boletos? Pagar x4 lo que cuesta un boleto en StubHub es algo de locos. \n\nLlevo desde el d\u00eda que salieron los boletos al p\u00fablico intentando comprar dos desde la p\u00e1gina oficial sin tener suerte. Tengo meses planeando, entraba diario a la p\u00e1gina para ver si ya estaban en venta, llegu\u00e9 hasta escoger boletos para el partido de Champions vs la Juve y hab\u00eda disponibilidad. \n\nHay alguna rivalidad fuere vs Valencia que haga imposible conseguir los boletos?\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBuying tickets is a nightmare for tourists who are not members, I imagine it is the same for people who live in Madrid.\n\nMy question is, is there any group that buys/sells tickets? Paying x4 what a ticket costs on StubHub is crazy.\n\nI've been trying to buy two from the official website since the day the tickets came out without any luck. I have been planning for months, I entered the page daily to see if they were already on sale, I got to choose tickets for the Champions vs Juve match and there was availability.\n\nIs there any rivalry between Valencia that makes it impossible to get the tickets?",
