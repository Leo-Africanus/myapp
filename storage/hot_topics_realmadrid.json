Same with Ancelotti out takes, I'm sorry but we have still won 2 ucls in 3 years under him, suffice to say I wanna give him another year and if he doesn't win both this year and next year then cool maybe it is time to let go. Plus Vini wasn't even bad today, he had some good dribbles and chances today, just couldn't get the finishing right. Whenever someone has successful dribbles such as Rodrygo today and Vini against Bayern last year, the fans praise them and say they are keeping true football alive when it is dying and yet as soon as they have one half bad game where they lose the ball a few times, the entire fanbase is ready to ship them off to another country.

        "content": "Nothing sarcastic please. I want a genuine explanation.\n\nIf this was Militao, I would understand ! Militao can make brain farts and dangerous mistakes, but he is very good ! Not as reliable as Rudiger, but he has so much heart on the field, he is good in aerial duals, he is fast...\n\nI'm not saying that this game was entirely on Tchouameni.. whole team played horrible minus a couple of ones... but I really don't understand this obsession of starting him. The Bernabeu have had enough and sent a message to both him AND Ancelotti by whistling them in the Celta Vigo game.\n\nBernabeu is not reactionary, but very demanding, they even whistled CR7... they are still supportive though. It clearly looks like they know Tchouameni this season has been ASS.. he plays one good game every 5 games and he gets to start, either as DM or as CB.. and he has been ASS in BOTH... and yet.. he keeps starting.\n\nI understand that our bench is not exactly stacked in defense, but come on, we have all seen how capable Asencio is... today.. both him and Fran had to deal with a long ball and an Espanyol player pressing, Fran cleared it without overthinking and Asencio elegantly returned safely to Courtois... Tchouameni tried to kong fu kick it and almost resulted in a dangerous chance..\n\nWhat does Ancelotti see in this player ? He has been good last season, I remember he was even better than Nacho as CB in the FIRST HALF of the season, when Nacho kept making mistakes and sent off.. is he trying to give him confidence, kinda like what he did last season with Nacho ? I genuinely want to understand.. or are those Perez orders, because he is a 100k euros player ?\n\nPS : So apparently he is a Xabi Alonso or Busquets in CDM position as many here are pointing that he is good in that position, then I'm watching the wrong games... I believe you should go and watch the Bar\u00e7a game, Milan game, Lille game, Bilbao game... and tell me what the fuck you saw there from CDM Tchouameni. It's like the same lazy excuse of Mbapp\u00e9 not playing in his natural position on the left when he was doing bad in the first start of the season",

Vazquez is a massive liability on defense, half the time he\u2019s nonexistent, and on offense he pushes far too high and is uncreative on the ball. He gets beat far too easily, is too slow to recover, and looks completely lost trying to cover defensively, especially covering the back post on counter attacking crosses. He\u2019s given up multiple goals in the last few months specifically in that manner. I\u2019m not sure why he\u2019s still getting minutes when Valverde already out classes him, and we have numerous talented midfielders. It should be Asencio and Valverde starting the right side of defense, but I think Vazquez is by far the biggest problem.",
