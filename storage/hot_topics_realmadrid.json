One day we are incredible and SOO BACK next day we are horrible and Xabi needs to go.\n\nSame thing for Vini and Xabi, they hugged and this sub: yeah see the media was lying they love each other. \n\nAre you seriously this delusional? There are things going on behind the scenes and it's obvious. Maybe they talked and found a solution. But don't act like there has never been something going on\n\nBe happy about our win but stop acting like everything went fine. It didn't. Mbappe turned up and decided he wanted us to win the match. This didn't look as convincing as most of you act. A more lethal striker of the opponent would have changed this game incredibly fast \n\n",

The player, now a key figure on the pitch and the team\u2019s top scorer, is asking for a top-level salary of\u00a06\u20137 million euros, while Juventus has offered just under 5 million (he earns 1,7 million euros plus bonuses atm). \n\nArsenal has recently made approaches and is fascinated by the Juventus number 10, though the club has never set a sale price and he remains under contract until 2029.\u00a0\n\nAmong all suitors,\u00a0Real Madrid stands out as one of the most interested clubs. Xabi Alonso is a long-time admirer, having already wanted Yildiz during his time at Bayer Leverkusen. He has now\u00a0recommended Yildiz to Real Madrid, which continues to monitor his performances closely. Until Juventus and the player reach an agreement on the renewal, further enquiries from major clubs \u2014\u00a0with Real Madrid at the forefront\u00a0\u2014 are expected.",

        "content": "First of all, don\u2019t get me wrong\u2026 Valverde is my favorite player at Real Madrid (especially after Modri\u0107 left), and I\u2019ll always be one of his biggest supporters and admirers. Even if his level drops a little, Fede remains an indispensable player for the team, and I don\u2019t agree with those who constantly criticize him and consider him one of the problems the team is suffering from.\n\nBut I can\u2019t hide the feeling that something has changed in the player\u2019s personality on the pitch\u2026 I\u2019m not talking about his performance right now, but about his character and mindset. You can feel that the current version of the player is \u201cvery dimmed and depressed\u201d and I notice it in his facial expressions\u2026 in his reactions to what happens on the field, especially when celebrating with teammates, or when he misses chances. You feel he\u2019s much less energetic than he used to be. There\u2019s a clear coldness in his current demeanor \u2014 when he talks to players, when he argues with referees\u2026 and that\u2019s unfortunate, especially since he\u2019s one of the team\u2019s leaders, and I've always considered him the heart and soul of the team. \n\nI don\u2019t believe everything that\u2019s being said about a conflict between him and Alonso. I know the press will write just for the sake of writing\u2026 It would be easy for Alonso to bench him and replace him with another player (with all the options available) if he wasn\u2019t satisfied with his level or behavior. But there\u2019s definitely something going on, and I hope I\u2019m wrong.\n\nAm I the only one who feels this way?",

If he avoids injuries for a whole season he'll be a top 3 midfielder in the world, he's such a unique player. That's a VERY big if tho",
