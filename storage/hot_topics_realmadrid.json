A lot of that can definitely be attributed to Ancelotti tactics (or lack thereof) and some gaps in the squad, but it's not like as soon as a new manager and players come, everything's fixed. These sort of things don't just change overnight.\n\nThe Club World Cup starts in mid-June. Xabi simply won't have the time to implement his tactics and philosophy. The new signings won't have enough time to synchronize with the current squad (all during CWC tournament nonetheless). I fear the fanbase will turn on our new members if they don't immediately deliver results or show promise. We all saw how they treated Mbapp\u00e9. Just imagine how Trent will be getting ripped on social media for a mistake. From Liverpool and Madrid fans alike. It's in times like those where it's most crucial that we back the players, especially during a period of transition.\n\nIn all, don\u2019t expect too much. Don\u2019t expect instant chemistry, instant structure, or trophies right out the gate. Just back the team. Back the project. Xabi and the players will need time. If you're ready to write people off in July, please take your 'support' somewhere else.",

Personally,  I am not thrilled with this, as I do not feel the need to have another superstar among the likes of Kylian, Jude, Vini, Rodrygo, and Trent. I would rather prefer a low profile signing (cost and fame wise) like Stiller, and then build using the talent we already have. \n\nI also feel that the arrival of another superstar would reduce the opportunities Arda would get, as I seriously believe in his talent as a player and to his commitment for Real Madrid.\n\nBetween Wirtz and Enzo, I think it would be Wirtz due to Xabi's preference. Plus I do not want Enzo Fernandez because of him being a racist mf. What do you guys think of Wirtz in the Real Madrid setup. Keeping aside the money, will he do wonders in the midfield with Jude and Valverde?",

But I couldn\u2019t find much content from our side \u2014 how we as Real Madrid fans reacted when he joined.\n\nI know Figo later proved himself and became a key part of the Gal\u00e1cticos, earning the love and respect of our fanbase. But I\u2019m curious \u2014 was he warmly welcomed from day one, or were there doubts and hate like what we saw with Mbapp\u00e9 recently (even though Mbapp\u00e9 didn\u2019t do anything close to what Figo did to Bar\u00e7a)?\n\nTo be honest, if someone like Rodri ever joined Madrid, I\u2019d struggle to accept it considering how he treated Vini. So I really wonder how Figo managed to win people over, and what the initial reaction was like when he first arrived.\n\nWould love to hear from older fans who remember that time or anyone who has insights!\n",

        "content": "El classico has been played for almost 125 years now. Yet this was the first time a hatrick came in a losing cause. This season was genuinely cursed especially if you think about how so many of our players got injured especially our defense.\n\nHopefully our next season is bettter. I would love to see mbappe win his first champions league and ballon d'or with us and a player of his quality quite frankly deserves it.",

This is a player who gave everything to Liverpool \u2014 youth academy product, key to their biggest successes in recent years, and he gets turned on the moment he considers a new challenge?\n\nIf he joins Madrid, I truly hope he silences every critic. I want to see him elevate his game, win titles, and become a legend here. Players with heart, vision, and ambition belong at Real Madrid.\n\nLet Anfield boo \u2014 the Bernab\u00e9u will roar louder.\nCome prove them wrong, Trent. Hala Madrid!\n\n",

Also if carreras does join we won\u2019t get him for the club World Cup right? He will be such a solid edition I\u2019m really hoping we end up signing him.\nI would also love to see arda guler play in an attacking mid role. Just wanted to see what you guys thought. \n\n",
