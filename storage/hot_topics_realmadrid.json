You guys feed into the media with your hate for certain players, and all it does is spread like a virus. I just saw a post on here gaining traction and the video is from \u201cTheHaterCentral\u201d on X. What other club\u2019s fanbase does some shit like that? When the fanbase wants all but a few players from the team gone it\u2019s a clear sign that there\u2019s delusion somewhere. This isn\u2019t FIFA, so players aren\u2019t going to come and go whenever YOU want. Shut the fuck up, stay calm, and support the team that you chose to \u201csupport\u201d. We have a bit over half of the season left. Stop overreacting and start watching the games in an unbiased way with your own eyes. I promise you\u2019ll enjoy it a lot more. ",

        "title": "Let's talk about Vini's issue",
        "content": "I don't want to demonize Vini, I like him since he came to Real Madrid and watched him grow to this day.\n\nHe certainly is a very good player, with such pace, dribbling and stamina. In his early years he always cause threat in big games, even though his shooting was bad at that time.\n\nHis problem really isn't technique, nor does he fear big opponents. It's his mentality of handling interaction both on an off the field. Other than the terrible racism, I guess it has to do with his coaches, Zidane favored Hazard over him, so it obviously made him more sensitive. Carlo gave him a lot of freedom, which is nice but we need something else after he became a top star. We need someone in the middle ground. Flo was also being very supportive to him. \n\nSo he sometimes has poor decision making, like this game. Before this season, he also had little chemistry with the LB. I don't think it's fair to blame it all to Mbappe or someone else. It's a new obstacle that Vini has to conquer after becoming a top star: His own ego. Maybe it's not just him after 23-24 season. \n\nXabi didn't have issue with Vini, he just wanted more discipline and had different approach. Even this season, he had played some very good games.  \n\nVini should have listened, maybe he did, but that outburst really disappointed me, it wasn't something right to do. And Xabi was too easy on it, it must have hurt the morale. It was probably Xabi's biggest mistake so far as well. It would make you lose your ground when you are trying to discipline others.\n\nI don't want Vini to go, not at all. We need him, but he really needs to pick himself up before he became a top star.",
