The start was rough, from missing penalties to not scoring easy goals, this man was made fun of countless times. People expected him to be perfect from day one. Questioned why he is being given so many chances when he doesn\u2019t play good. But he needed that to build his confidence. Mbappe deserves an apology. He has been the most consistent recently. He tries his best every single match and you can tell from his performance. Goal or no goal, he gives his 100% when on the field and the way he silenced everyone is satisfying. Mbappe has scored in all the last 5 matches. I hope he keeps doing what he is doing. \n",

        "content": "1. Ancelotti finally listened and played Asencio as a right back and it paid off. The boy was immense but not just him the whole back line looked really comfortable like they could trust one another \n\n2. It feels good to keep a clean sheet after God knows how many matches \n\n3. Rodrygo again proves why he can't remove Vini from the LW position. I don't expect a player to drop 10/10 every match but he was really passive in todays match which was a great chance for him to really push on and cement his place in the team\n\n4. Ceballos was very impressive today and I see signs on Busquets in him more than Kroos. I'm not saying he's on the same level as Busquets but his game is similar in that he's hard to press, has quick feet, wants to play forward and can draw a foul when he's double pressed.\n\n5. This match was not the worst to watch considering we struggle to create chances against low block teams. I hope to see performances like this against the better teams though so I'm taking this result with a grain of salt.\n\n6. Please rest Valverde some matches because he looked like he almost pulled something. Him and Camavinga play similarly so he could be use to give Valverde some rest\n\n7. Happy for Mbappe finally showing his quality and scoring a hatty. Just needs to master timing his run against teams that high press and he'll be pretty much unstoppable \n\n8. I am finally read to admit that maybe, just maybe Fran is ready to dislodge Mendy and Mendy should be back up and I don't think Mendy would mind being backup. He seems like a humble personality and I don't think we should get rid of him\n\n9. Hala Madrid.\n\n10. Upvote if you want me to do a video on this match analysis the goals and plays.",

        "content": "For example in today's game after the 2nd goal we could've given both of them some rest maybe? Am not really an expert but by the looks of it Valverde was limping and might've pulled a hamstring. Both of them have insane work rate and are very hungry for minutes understandable but the season is sooo long for us , we'll have to play a qualifiers in CL too. Our next game is again in 3-4 days surely resting them earlier would've helped. I CANNOT imagine what will happen if we loose Bellingham or Valverde at such a crucial stage. Is it just me or do y'all share my thoughts?",
