        "title": "Alvaro Carreras Profile",
        "content": "After reading the transfer news on Alvaro Carreras I decided to watch the Benfica - Braga match today\u2026 Here are my thoughts. Carreras is not yet a Champions League knockout full back.\n\nDefending: This is a strong point for Carreras. He is a very strong 1-1 defender, his performances against Lamine Yamal here. He has a good ability to read the game and is very good in the tackle. His performance today also underscored this as he made a game saving tackle before the goal. His height is also another strong point. This is encouraging because if he were playing alongside TAA I imagine Carreras could tuck in more when TAA goes up and still defend well against more physical forwards. One thing that concerns me is his work rate, to be frank Carreras looked tired today against Braga. Frequently he was caught up field and noticeably slow coming back. \n\nIn Possession: This is the biggest problem. Carreras vs Braga today made multiple unforced errors and was unable to effectively progress the ball. I understand the numbers tell a different story but this is the Portuguese league and against better teams like Braga today I believe he will struggle. The man could not string two forward passes together and reminded me of Mendy, it looked like his Benfica teammates were afraid to pass him the ball. Ultimately Carreras is very raw and I think that there will be a marked improvement as he matures because he does have the technical ability to succeed. However, this would be our starting LB and his quality in possession will have a negative impact on the biggest games next season.\n\nAttacking: Carreras is an attacking fullback and he does perform well further up the pitch. Especially with space he has ok crossing (at least it\u2019s better than Mendy) and he does succeed in dribbling the ball. He\u2019s a good enough threat especially if paired with TAA where he might stay further back and let Vini command the left.\n\nFinal thoughts: Carreras looks very raw. He has the potential to be a very strong player in the future but his performance today vs Braga was very bad. Ultimately I think that he\u2019s still only back up quality for Madrid. He reminds me of Mendy\u2019s profile early on in his Madrid career. All this to say I do think that other options, especially Theo, should be considered. Carreras will not be cheap and he will be one of the weakest players in the starting 11. If we end up with him and Fran as our LBs I see it costing us games.",
