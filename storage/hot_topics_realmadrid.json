Lets say Mastantouno shares right wing with Rodrygo. thats still 7 top midfielders that deserve a lot of playing time. I know we had tonnes of injuries and many games but I feel like someones gotta go.\n\nIll even say Rodrygo should share left wing with Vini and Arda and Franco share right wing, just to give more space to more players. Thats still 6 players competing for limited spots.\n\nHow do you guys see this playing out? Is everyone going to be happy? Are the younger players like Arda, Franco and Cama going to stay as rotation players and stall their progress? The 2 players i see most unhappy here are Brahim and Ceballos and personally I wouldnt want either of them to leave. But if they arent consistent and stamping their identity on the team like the others, I feel they are the most likely to be unhappy by midseason with lack of minutes.\n\nEDIT FORGOT TO ADD: Bellingham will probably miss first 3 months if he does the shoulder surgery so that may give more minutes to someone ",

Losing CR7 with no replacement meant that 18/19 season was doomed to fail. \n\nIn terms of a single moment though, that horror week of 18/19 tops everything. In one week we lost 3 matches at the Bernabeu, 0-3 to Barca in CDR, again lost to Barca 0-1 in the league and then lost to Ajax 1-4. Knocked out of all 3 in one week. Nothing tops that.\n",
