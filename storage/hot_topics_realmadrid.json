He would\u2019ve just played it safe and pushed Bellingham up as a false nine. As for Mastantuono \u2014 we know how that story goes. He\u2019d spend months with Castilla, late sub appearances when we're winning 3-0, maybe start a Copa del Rey game against a third-tier side, and then be loaned out the following season.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen that cycle too many times.\n\nFor the first time in years, it feels like we\u2019ve got a coach who truly trusts the young talents and isn\u2019t afraid to throw them straight into the action when they\u2019re ready \u2014 no unnecessary waiting and \u2018developing\u2018. \n\n",

Because he excels in breaking down the low block with his close control and creativity and precision when linking with other teammates. Vini on the otherhand is brilliant on the counter, but when faced with a reluctant low block is less effective, we then get less chances in the box, and he gets more frustrated especially when playing away. \n\nThis game faced with a low block team, Xabi started with Rodrygo because he trusts in Rodrygo linking up well and surgically getting into the box. This resulted in us having 17 shots in the first half with 8 shots in the box. Then with Oviedo needing a goal and pushing up, Vini was subbed on and secured the win with his brilliant counter attacking threat. \n\nIf Rodrygo is still a Madrid player and Xabi sticks to this plan even at home, we could see Rodrygo starting against Mallorca.

Winning the Champions League with Inter is not the same as winning it with Real Madrid. And you might say that I was at Real Madrid and I didn't win the Champions League. No, I didn't, but I won the league title and the cup title against the best team in the world, which was Barcelona, and I broke a huge cycle of Barcelona dominating Real Madrid. Also my last European title with Roma, which is Roma's only ever European title. Having not only the number of titles I have but also the way I have done it in, if you don't think I'm one of the greatest, I have to disagree.\"",

        "content": "I keep seeing the same talking points from our own fanbase that honestly sound more like they were written in Barcelona than in Madrid. Let me explain.\n\nThe only place this whole \u201cwe need to build everything from our academy\u201d model has \u201cworked\u201d is Bar\u00e7a \u2014 and even then, it\u2019s more myth than reality. Outside of them, you don\u2019t see this model winning consistently. Madrid has always had a different system: phasing out older players at the right time, mixing elite talent we buy with academy products, and keeping the infrastructure strong. That\u2019s what makes us sustainable.\n\nYet every time ESPN or Bar\u00e7a Twitter pushes a narrative, I see Madridistas fold. Suddenly everyone is demanding a \u201cwonderkid\u201d to rival Bar\u00e7a, or parroting lines about P\u00e9rez, Ancelotti, or even Vini like they\u2019re reacting to Bar\u00e7a\u2019s PR machine instead of thinking for themselves.\n\nSome context:\n\nMadrid has always developed and sold talent. Hakimi, \u00d8degaard, Morata, Llorente, Reguil\u00f3n \u2014 that\u2019s not a bug, that\u2019s how the club operates. It's q model to make profit. \n\nThe \u201cMadrid only buys stars, Bar\u00e7a makes stars\u201d story is a complete fabrication. They bought Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Coutinho, Griezmann, F\u00e9lix\u2026  for hundreds of millions of $ and how did that go? Even with La Masia, for every Messi or Xavi there are dozens of players who never made it.\n\nWhen people complain that we don\u2019t \u201ctrust youth,\u201d they forget players like Valverde, Vini, Rodrygo, Nacho, Carvajal \u2014 all trusted, all developed into core pieces. But nobody wants to give credit when it doesn\u2019t fit the Bar\u00e7a-created story.\n\n\n\n\nGuess who trusted vini ? Ancelotti perhaps. Same guy who doesn't trust the youth?\n\n\n\nThe sad truth? Bar\u00e7a\u2019s PR has done such a good job that it\u2019s shaping how some of our own fans view our club. You hear people repeating \u201cwe don\u2019t develop talent\u201d or \u201cwe need to be more like them,\u201d when the reality is they should be wishing they were more like us.\n\nMadrid doesn\u2019t need to prove itself against Bar\u00e7a\u2019s fairytales. We already have the formula that works \u2014 history proves it.\n ",

        "content": "Obviously Mbappe has been effective these last two games, but I honestly believe that he takes away from our attacking threat when he\u2019s not in the center forward position. Whenever he drifts to the left we often have the ball on either side of the pitch and have no one making runs through the middle. Maybe I\u2019m just knit picking but it\u2019s just something I observed the last two games, what are your thoughts?",
