        "content": "^(This is a last chance most probably for Rodrygo to prove his worth ....we all know he is a good player but Is he better than VINI ?)\n\n^(I cant remember a game where he started and have done well ,its always from the bench...Its been a long draught since his goal . I will he scored today)\n\nOne more important thing - If by chance rodrygo doesnt perform today and vini coming from the bench do better than him . Than i request mods to remove all hate posts related to vini .\n\nHe is one of the worlds best player and was last season as well.\n\nDont come at me with he was shit last season ...he had more goals then ballondor 2 Yamal and almost as much assists. Numbers dont lie. He is an outstanding player and so is rodrygo but if rodrygo doesnt perform today like the getafe match . No Vini hateposts allowed .\n\nSometimes i think our Sub is full of plastics the players other clubs would die for are given so much hate . I just cant stand own fans sometimes .\n\nLook at other clubs they defend there players even if they do not do well look at wirtz isak sesko salah pedro all forwards who have almost negligible output ,\n\nWhile our player who got 9 g/a in 15 match is given hate.\n\nDissapointed in this sub.",

        "content": "So I compiled a list of defenders and compared them to Sergio Ramos. \n\nAccording to the stats, this is the outcome of the research.\n\nAfter Alaba and Rudiger leave we should sign Vuskovic and bring back Ramon. \n\nSo our four centre backs will be Militao, Huijsen, Vuskovic and Ramon.\n\nWe could also get Konate for free but Asencio may need to leave. And I don't think Konate would fit Alonso's style to be honest. Anyways I digress.  \n\n\n\n3. The \"Ramos Copycat\" Ranking\nThis ranking weighs Aerial Dominance (30%), Ball Playing (30%), Goal Threat (20%), and Aggression/Presence (20%).\n\n\n\n\n1\tLuka Vuskovic\t88%\tThe closest thing to a young Ramos. Huge goal threat, 97th percentile aerials, and plays with a \"chaos\" factor. He just needs to refine his passing.\n\n\n2\tJacobo Ram\u00f3n\t82%\tThe \"System\" Successor. Already on Madrid's books. He has the elite passing and strong aerials (74%) to fit the role perfectly, though less of a goal threat than Vuskovic.\n\n\n3\tTiago Gabriel\t75%\tThe Wildcard. 1 goal in 10 games and strong aerials. A very raw, aggressive profile that mimics Ramos's early Sevilla days.\n\n\n4\tIbrahima Konat\u00e9\t65%\tMatches the aerial dominance, but is too \"safe\" on the ball and doesn't score enough to be a true Ramos clone.\n\n\n5\tWilliam Saliba\t40%\tThe Varane Clone. He is elite, but he is \"polite\" (0 yellow cards). Ramos was a warrior; Saliba is a surgeon.\n\n\n6\tMicky van de Ven\t25%\tA Ferrari of a defender, but poor in the air and average distribution. He is a completely different breed of CB.",
