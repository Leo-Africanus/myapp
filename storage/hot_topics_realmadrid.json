This is the first time I see the club doing something like this. The board must be furious after these decisions, it's not the first time the VAR is pretending to be asleep.. not only they turn blind eyes on these fouls, but the 2 times Mbapp\u00e9 was on side, yet the VAR checked only the frame AFTER the ball was passed and Mbapp\u00e9 is offside.. and this right here could have easily ended Mbapp\u00e9's career. the tackle was horrible ! \n\nWhat are your thoughts on the club posting this ?

Was in a good position to pass and decided to shoot from a tight angle.\n\nHow come Vini gets all the hate when they were other players including Rodrygo who didn't really perform.\n\nMbappe should have came off at around 70 minutes and so should Bellingham for Arda and Endrick and Brahim came on for Rodrygo.\n\nAncelotti waited till it was too late and lost our momentum when we had them on the back foot but some people here will still be abusing and attacking other fans for having opinions when we can all see the same shit week in week out.\n\nAnd no Rudiger might have a hamstring because the manager barely fucking rotates and makes subs way too late every effing match. He will get praise for making Asencio \"better\" when in reality he's only force to play him because of injury. ",

        "content": "This season so far has been mixed bags and while we have individually top players, we also lack balance in the team. \n\nFor example there's no cohesion in midfield and we lack a playmaker who can connect the team, play in pocket spaces and break lines with through balls.\n\nWe have average at best fullbacks and have an ageing defence as well as Militao who might not get back to previous level with back to back ACLs.\n\nThese are the signings I would go for if it was up to me.\n\n1. Wirtz - Xabi might become our next coach and who's the better option to be playmaker than his best player. Wirtz is arguably the best playmaker in the game right now and can bring much needed creativity to our midfield.\n\n2. TAA - Wish Hakimi was playing anywhere but PSG or James wasn't made of glasses. Trent is extraordinary with ball and although he isn't good defensively, he can give different dimension to our attack and spark some thing in often dead right sided attack.\n\n3. Huijsen - Everytime I watch him, he keeps impressing. Tall, young and ball playing defender who's Spanish on top of it. He can be the future of our defence.\n\n4. Miguel - With Davies most likely renewal at Bayern, our options are slim and need to spend more money elsewhere. Miguel can be cost effective yet a very good option.\n\nOnes to keep an eye on.\n1. Murillo - Has been a beast for Nottingham and with recent renewal, move is unlikely. He has potential to play for Madrid in coming years.\n\n2. Nico Paz - One of our own and has been very good for Como. Another season in serie A can do him well at this time though.\n\n3. Angelo Stiller - There's lack of quality deep lying playmakers among the youngsters right now. Stiller is one to look for among the few options out there and I won't be surprised if any big team moves for him soon.",

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m with Carlo on this. In just three years, he\u2019s won two Champions League titles and a La Liga title, yet the club continues to treat him with a lack of respect. Last summer, he  asked for a replacement for Kroos, this is why we were linked to kimmich but the board rejected his request. Now, he\u2019s once again pushing for reinforcements in midfield and at right-back this window, only to be turned down again. It\u2019s unfortunate a manager  who has delivered so much success for this club is being undermined at every turn.\n\nTo make matters worse, every time the team loses a match, there\u2019s immediate speculation in the media\u2014often fueled by sources close to the board\u2014about his job security. This kind of instability is unacceptable, especially when you compare it to how other top clubs operate. Take Guardiola, for example. When Manchester City lost five games in a row, there was never any  discussion about his future. Instead, the club backed him in the January transfer window, spending \u20ac200 million to strengthen the squad, and they\u2019re now on the verge of signing another midfielder for \u20ac60 million.\n\nThis lack of respect for managers who has won a lot for the club is exactly why Zidane left. The board seems to take success for granted, failing to recognize that maintaining dominance requires consistent investment and trust in the manager\u2019s vision. While players like Vazquez and Ceballos are valuable squad members, they\u2019re not at the same level as Carvajal or Kroos. Expecting the team to perform at the highest level without addressing these gaps is unrealistic and unfair to both the manager and the players.\n\n",

        "content": "This is the most entitled fanbase I've seen cuz jesus christ, the number of games Vini has delivered and bailed us out there is no way people are asking to sell him to Saudi rn just cuz Rodrygo and Mbappe have suddenly found their form for the last few games. Same with Ancelotti out takes, I'm sorry but we have still won 2 ucls in 3 years under him, suffice to say I wanna give him another year and if he doesn't win both this year and next year then cool maybe it is time to let go. Plus Vini wasn't even bad today, he had some good dribbles and chances today, just couldn't get the finishing right. Whenever someone has successful dribbles such as Rodrygo today and Vini against Bayern last year, the fans praise them and say they are keeping true football alive when it is dying and yet as soon as they have one half bad game where they lose the ball a few times, the entire fanbase is ready to ship them off to another country. I can't.",
