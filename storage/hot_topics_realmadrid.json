He\u2019s leading the charts for most chances created in Europe\u2019s top 5 leagues for under 21 players, and he plays for 13th place Como. He already knows our team, he\u2019s trained with the first squad, he\u2019s had minutes with them, he understands the dynamic and the expectations. That matters. We have a buyback clause of 8 million this summer. I\u2019ve been seeing a lot rumours of him being linked with Inter lately and Serie A fans really rate him. I think it\u2019d be a real shame if we don\u2019t bring back a youth player.  ",
