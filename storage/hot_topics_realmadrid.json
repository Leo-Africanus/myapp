        "content": "I've been wanting to hear opinion about Lucas that isn't a kneejerk reaction that comes off the back of a poor performance or a missed penalty (imagine the angry mob if we didn't make it past Atleti lol)\n\nMy case for Lucas\n\nFootballers aren't Swiss Army knives, not all of them anyways. Certainly not Lucas.  \nHe's our backup RB because once upon a time Carvajal was out injured and at the time we didn't have a backup RB (for the record, we still don't) so he was asked (or volunteered) to perform a role that isn't actually his. He did an okay/decent job back then, and sure some of us joke around calling him Lord Vazquez and Cafucas, but those names came from somewhere. In my mind, that can be considered some form of evidence that he performed well at some point.\n\nFast forward to today and his performances at RB have clearly taken a dip. That is undeniable. However, every time I see people calling for his head every game. None of this is on Lucas, it's on management. Every player that's played at RB over the last x number of seasons that is not named Dani Carvajal has *not* been an actual fullback; Lucas (not a fullback), Nacho (a versatile defender), Valverde (can do the job but is not a fullback), Asencio (versatile defender and really got a shot because of poor planning), Militao (CB).\n\nWhy is context thrown away every time his name comes up lately? You have a guy who is really one of the few options we have performing a role that isn't really his.  \nAgain, I'm not excusing his performances, they have been shaky at best. However he is a winger in a fullback costume and I judge him that way. The same way I would judge Rodrygo, for example, if he were playing at fullback.\n\nWhat am I missing here? Is the criticism *fair*? What are your thoughts?",

And honestly, Manuel Angel is the player that got my attention more than anyone else.\n\nHis playing style is kinda similar to Pedri.. his technique, vision, passes, dribbling skills.. very impressive.\n\nBut I know watching highlights isn't enough to judge a player. So if anyone here is watching RM Castilla, how good is Manuel Angel? I know he missed many matches this season due to injuries. Is he good enough to get promoted to the first team? ",

        "title": "Madrid has better chances to win this league than you think",
        "content": "We have already played against Betis and Villarreal, who are arguably the next two most challenging teams after Bilbao and Atleti with Barca still needing to face them. Barcelona continues to demonstrate their defensive vulnerability, and they have generally faced easier opponents in the new year, with Rayo Vallecano and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid being notable exceptions. Real Madrid is also regaining a more typical lineup, with the return of established defenders like R\u00fcdiger and Alaba at center back, and Tchouam\u00e9ni back in his natural position as a holding midfielder. Fran and Lucas have adapted well to the team's pace and are displaying strong defensive solidity. With Tchouam\u00e9ni anchoring the midfield, Bellingham is now free to play further forward, recreating the advantage he so effectively provided last season through his pressing, strength, aerial prowess, and ability to link up with Vin\u00edcius Jr. and Mbapp\u00e9. This configuration reduces pressure on our offense during attack generation and lessens concerns when plays break down, as the team's balance has been restored. Moreover, Valverde, Rodrygo, Brahim, and Camavinga act as the glue, covering overlapping runs, pressing, and producing moments of magic.\n\nMy only concern is the possibility of further injuries, but Ancelotti now has greater flexibility for substitutions with the return of Alaba and Camavinga. This allows him to rest players and maintain a solid defensive structure.  With a less demanding schedule while Mendy is out, we hope he can get the rest he needs and return stronger to help secure the league title. At the start of the year, despite being in first place, we had a defensively vulnerable team and relied heavily on Ceballos for defensive midfield presence. He performed phenomenally, but it required a larger defensive contribution from the whole team.  Importantly, during that period of vulnerability, Tchouam\u00e9ni was forced to play center back due to injuries. Now, with his return to holding midfield with Asencio being a trusted starter at center back, and Alaba's comeback from injury, we have much greater defensive stability in our natural position. Tchouam\u00e9ni also is much more experienced because he undertook an intensive course in defending while filling in at center back. The demands of defending are immense constant pressure and the need for unwavering focus, otherwise you concede or Courtois comes to the rescue. There will be more goals, better football, and lower blood pressure for us all. Hala Madrid!",

        "title": "Is Madridista premium worth it?",
        "content": "Hi guys, no clue how many people here can help me with this. I've been a Madrid fan for some years now and I've finally got a stable job that'll give me the income to go and travel to Spain and watch actual games. Luckily I'm only in the UK so Spain isn't too far from me at all. I was wondering, for tickets I've been snooping around StubHub so far however the prices baseline are great (for example, great seats for Sociedad at the Bernabeu are \u00a3195) however with the sales tax and all this ends up being \u00a3295. I know near machday they get a little cheaper but considering I have to fly there, the flights will go up in price the more last minute I book the flight. \n\nI'm willing to spend max 650/700 each time I go all in. So far I've calculated the flight will be around \u00a3200 and the tickets around \u00a3300/350ish. \n\nThe rest can just be hotel for one night and spending money on like Ubers and food for example. So I was wondering, how much would Madridista premium save me on these tickets? I know resale can be crazy expensive, and if it means my flight only goes up by \u00a350/60 I'm not worried at all. Anyone got a clue how much tickets are once they actually release and all? Or if they've had issues getting any? ",

        "content": "Madrid now have only 10 games to play in la liga. Currently barca has played 27 games and they have equal points as madrid and they have 16 more in goal difference. Out of these games , one of the games consists of the el classico and with our recent record against barca , I am in deep doubt about what we will do in the upcoming la liga classico. Also , the team is facing issues with Vini which is definitely something unwanted by the fans as well as the players.  Because of such reasons , I believe that we should be try not to be upset if we lose the title race and be happy and satisfied with the fact that we have won two trophies , which is better than winning nothing.
