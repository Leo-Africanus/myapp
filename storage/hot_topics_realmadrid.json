        "title": "Mastantuono: A better version of me is coming\"",
        "content": "Some of Mastantuono's quotes after his great game vs Monaco.\n\nThe maturity this kid is showing at 18, fresh off arriving at the biggest club on the planet, is super rare for a young talent. Huge positive sign for his future.\n\n**A bit of a strange season, Franco, you started off being very important with Xabi.**\n\n\"But it's not over yet, there are still 6 months left. There were quite a few matches, I think about half of the games that have been played. For a kid who arrives at 18 and plays that many games, I think that's quite a lot. As you say, I didn't have my best first six months, not even close to what I can do, but everything helps me learn. There are six months left that I think are the most decisive, and I'm going to go for that to show my best version.\"\n\n**How have you managed those moments?**\n\n\"Working, working. I lean a lot on my teammates, I lean a lot on the people who are with me. I have a really nice close circle that takes care of me, that loves me, that I love them too, and that's what keeps me happy all the time. Football is a sport where sometimes things go well, sometimes they go badly. From my side, I'm going to give everything so that things turn out as best as possible, but many times they don't, you have to accept it. They weren't my best games, my best months, but I know a better version of me is coming, by working and with confidence.\"\n\n\"I think what gives me the most joy tonight is seeing Vini like that, seeing Jude, they are people I love a lot and who honestly are going to help us a lot to achieve those important things we have ahead. They are some of the best players in the world and having them doing well is a huge plus for us. When Vini is like that, he's undefendable and I think he's going to help us a lot this year.\"\n\n\"Yes, it helped me a lot with my confidence because, as I said, I had gone several games without playing, and obviously a player doesn't like being off the pitch, doesn't like being injured, doesn't like not being able to be part of it. I had to take on another role, which I fulfilled and tried to do as best as I could. But today this goal helped me a lot to loosen up, to clear my head, and to be able to show my best.\"\n\n**Harsh criticism:**\n\n\"Yes, but I understand them too. Since I was little I've had the luck and the misfortune of people talking about me. They could say things like I was the new Messi... and they could say things like I was a disaster and the worst signing in Real Madrid history. I don't think I'm Messi and I never will be Messi, but I also don't think I'm the worst signing in Madrid's history. I work to be good and to be that best version I can have. Criticism with bad intentions does hurt, but we're in the elite of football and that's how it is.\"\n\n**The boos and whistles at the Bernab\u00e9u:**\n\n\"We're not a bunch of idiots, we know the things we're doing wrong. We have to change that mentality to show what we're really capable of. I talked a lot with Vini, what happened is understandable. Maybe it's not fair that they boo him alone or in that way\u2014I think we're all responsible for the bad moment we're going through. I haven't shown my best version, I don't think anyone has shown their best version lately, and I think we're all responsible. It's understandable that Real Madrid fans are angry because we know we're at the biggest club in the world. I don't think what's happening with Vini is fair, but yes, we understand being whistled at in our own home because we lost games we shouldn't have lost. But it helps us to be more self-demanding and to improve\".",

        "content": "Today the Bernab\u00e9u responded. No boos, just support. The atmosphere was behind the team from the first minute, and the result was positive.\n\nBut this has to be the standard, not the exception. We need consistency, focus, and commitment every match. Supporting the team doesn\u2019t mean lowering expectations, it means pushing together in the right direction.\n\nGood step today. Now let\u2019s keep building. HALA MADRID",

        "content": "How do people go from saying the club is in shambles to saying we are back and Arbeloa is the new Zidane?\n\nToday was a great game but plenty of teams get a new manager bounce and I\u2019m sure getting booed provided lots of motivation to perform and give their all.\n\nMonaco is currently 9th in Ligue 1. It\u2019s not a horrible league but everyone knows it\u2019s not very competitive. We have had over a year of inconsistent performances both with Ancelotti and Xabi and even though we won with Ancelotti, plenty of people in this sub thought he was the problem.\n\nI hope I\u2019m wrong and we continue this way but I find it hard to believe that both of these managers were our biggest issue.\n\nI hope these performances continue but we can\u2019t automatically believe that this will be the new normal after one game against a lower opposition team. \n\nLet\u2019s give it some time.\n\nHala Madrid!!!",
