A potential foul afterwards in the box is challenged for review by Arbeloa\n\n90'+2 - after a very long review, the ref decides no penalty\n\n\ud83d\udfe5 90'+6 - second yellow for Lamini who makes a stupid and unnecessary tactical foul while already on a yellow \n\nFT - a decent second half is too little after league leaders Tenerife had already decided the match in the first. A 1-3 loss against what is clearly the best team in the division is normally no shame, but with now 4 losses in a row and multiple players missing the next weeks due to the U20 World Cup + Fettal injured and Lamini now suspended, the situation is looking extremely dire and hopeless for Arbeloa's team.

Mind you this is a club that was once feared in the entire football world for scoring from crosses with the likes of CR7, Ramos, Big Benz, etc. \n\nThis makes our attack so pathetically one-dimensional it\u2019s hilarious. You got fans in this sub who think we\u2019re going to win the league/CL by just having Guler spam a million through balls to Mbappe. Even Barcelona who has never been known for crossing the ball a lot, have an aerial threat in Lewandowski, and Raphinha is decent at scoring from crosses. \n\nOh, one more thing, can we sack our set piece coach asap? Atletico could have scored 3 goals from corners yesterday. Meanwhile, all our set pieces were absolute dogshit. ",

        "content": "Not the result we wanted, but honestly, I don\u2019t think this is the end of the world. Yes, we got humbled, but I can actually see some positives and lessons for the future. Here are my thoughts on where Xabi slipped up:\n\n1. **Jude starting** \u2013 Should\u2019ve been used as a super sub. His impact off the bench could\u2019ve flipped the game.\n2. **Arda being subbed off** \u2013 Huge mistake. The kid is our main playmaker, and pulling him killed our creative spark.\n3. **Aerial weakness** \u2013 With R\u00fcdiger out, we had no presence in the air. Against Atleti, that\u2019s a recipe for disaster.\n4. **Vini vs Rodrygo** \u2013 Rodrygo\u2019s scoring record against Atleti speaks for itself. He should\u2019ve replaced Vini.\n5. **Inexperience** \u2013 Dean, Carreras and others still don\u2019t fully grasp the intensity and tactical grind of a derby. It showed.\n\nBut here\u2019s the silver lining: this loss might be the best thing for us. The players won\u2019t get carried away with confidence, and it gives them a reason to dig deeper, fight harder, and sharpen up before Barca. Better to take this lesson now than be exposed later.\n\nThe future still looks exciting. We\u2019ve got a young core, a coach who\u2019s learning, and a squad that will only get better from here.",

        "content": "Took a while to process the loss and I really had to try to not let it affect my whole weekend. In saying this, I fully blame the loss on Alonso because its obvious the team selection was dog shit and rushing back Bellingham even though we all are happy he's recovered from surgery but playing him in a match of that caliber was a huge mistake.\n\nI think what made it even more shocking was that Alonso has played in these derbies as a player and he should have 1000 percent know the type of intensity that simeone and Atletico were coming with and it seems he underestimated this and paid for it but ultimately defeats like this are totally unacceptable. If we had lost 3-2 it would have been a sad loss but an understandable one but a Madrid team should never lose any match against any team by more than a 2 goal margin. I don't care how good the team is, if we need to play Mourinho type football to get the win of stop the bleeding then the player should fucking do that.\n\nAlso why have we collectively as a club decided that Ceballos cannot be a regular for madrid, there seems to be this idea going on that he's not madrid quality but funnily enough I don't remember him ever playing and us losing by a huge margin and if places on the team are truly based on merit then he should be playing and deserves a chance to prove and cement his place in the starting lineup just like any other expensive signing.\n\nOverall, these humiliating defeats need to stop, losing is a part of the game that we can accept but losing 4 nil and 5-2 like this is just not acceptable for a club of this standard and we as a fanbase should not accept it because its a slippery slope.",

        "content": "I had a feeling when Kroos left that things wouldn\u2019t be the same for a while, and I hate to admit it, but it seems to be true.\n\nWe\u2019ve always had great players BUT we had leaders, in attack, in midfield, and in defense. Right now, there\u2019s a lot of talent in the squad, but I don\u2019t see anyone truly leading. It feels like eleven great players who don\u2019t really know how to work together or who to look to in tough moments.\n\nMaybe with time they\u2019ll grow into those roles, but for the next couple of years, I don\u2019t see us winning anything major or competing with Europe\u2019s best. The sooner we accept that and manage our expectations, the easier it\u2019ll be for us as fans :)",

Look at how bad atleti wanted to beat us, and yet our players looked like they couldn't care less if we got hit 10-0. Observe how barca's mentality changed and how easy it is for them to make comebacks from being 2 or 3 goals down, we used to be like that as well but now it's not looking so good. I hope alonso could fix it because getting hammered 5-2 wouldn't be as bad if the players actually looked like they cared about anything",

        "content": "I'm going to try not be reactionary but my word that was dreadful.\n\n*Bad Start*: We looked out of sorts for majority of the game (bar that 10-15 minute spell in the first half where we equalised &amp; lead) &amp; it's somewhat been coming. In some our earlier games this season we have looked lacklustre in defence &amp; chasing back/clearing balls when we lose them &amp; have been saved by moments of brilliance (Carreras vs Mallorca) or the opposition being dog shit.\n\nMistakes: Dean's potential is limitless &amp; I think he'll be a great player but I think we crowned him too early. He's made a few costly mistakes this season &amp; yesterday he was exposed. He's what? Almost 2m tall but he can't win aerial duels? That's pathetic. Carreras almost got sent off &amp; he also didn't look like he was up to the occasion.\n\nSelection: Not sure what Xabi's thinking was with starting both Jude &amp; Arda especially when Jude hadn't played 90 total minutes especially when Franco was right there coming off a good game midweek. Jude looked invisible out there, if there was a game to get him up to speed, it should've been midweek (I know hindsight is 20/20). He should've made better subs in the 70th-75th minute when it was clear that trying neat dribbles into the box wasn't working &amp; try something different with Gonzalo. \n\n\nConclusion: I'm really hoping it's a one off because of the occasion but the two times we've played \"decent\" teams we've been embarrassed, it's not filling me with confidence especially with the schedule coming. I trust Xabi to turn it around but that should not happen again. Hopefully the players actually show up next time. ",
