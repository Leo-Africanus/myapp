He's helping out the main men up fron each game and i feel like since mbappe's arrival fans are treating him like a ordinary player which he absolutely isn't.  He's been active and his work rate is great. He is creating, scoring and time and again holding the links in the attacks and in the midfield from time to time. \n2) Raul Asensio: no one in the beginning of the season would have thought that he will be getting this much time but i am glad he did get it. \nHe's proved that he is worthy of being in that position and man i am a fan of his play style.  With our main guys injured he has done a phenomenal job at defense so far. \n3) Finally Fede. Is there a position this guy can't play at?\nHe's done and is doing a great job at midfield. He's scoring bangers after bangers this season and now his defensive work as the RB against City was so dammm good. He was holding players down, winning duels , slide tacking them giving great clearance his distribution looked great. He's just amazing at everything he does.\n",
