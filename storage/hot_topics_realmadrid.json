        "title": "If the rumor is true that we are working on a surprise signing from today's final is true, I really hope it's Nuno Mendez",
        "content": "This guy is a Glactico worthy signing. He can play LB and CM, and he is only 22 years old.\n\nCouple months ago Fabrice Hawkins reported that Nuno Mendes does not want to renew with PSG but he ended up signing a deal till 2029, so if we want to sign him, we have to offer a Glactico free.\n\nRationally, it might probably be Zubamendi. As Xabi shows alot of intrest in him but I feel Tchou and Zubi share a similar role and Tchou has been immense in 2025. So I am 50/50 on that signing and favor stiller as he is a different type of player similar to Kroos. \n\n  \n\n\n",

I even reached out to an Insta page per a suggestion, but I doubt I'll get a response. I would greatly appreciate any help you can provide regarding this. I have been patiently waiting and asking around since getting to Madrid at the end of last month about whether the presentation will be before or after the CWC. I can't believe it's happening while I'm still here! Ahhh! Please help!\n\nGracias!\n\n",
