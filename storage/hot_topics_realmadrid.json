They\u2019re playing like they have a point to prove and it\u2019s that energy that will win us trophies. \n\nAn area of vast improvement that needs to be made is our counter attacks. We need to work on killing off games. We keep making bad individual mistakes like a terrible final pass or bad finish. Some of our players will make bad decisions like trying to score a goal themselves when they should pass for a tap on. They keep fumbling and It\u2019s going to cost us eventually. Last game Barca had opportunities to equalize and all our hard work would have been for nothing. The week before Getafe almost scored in the last few minutes of the game and we would have dropped points. \n\nMaybe because Xabi has only been here for a few months he is focusing on implementing his system and hasn\u2019t had time to drill in counters. Once we improve that area of our game we will dominate and win games more comfortably. \n",

        "title": "Kroos defends Vinicius, but teaches him a lesson: \"I didn't like being substituted either.\"",
        "content": "Toni Kroos knows Vinicius well . He's been with him in the Real Madrid locker room and knows how he breathes, how things affect him, and also his temperament once his heart rate drops. In his podcast, the former German player reviews El Cl\u00e1sico and pays special attention to Vini's anger when Xabi Alonso substituted him for Rodrygo.\n\n\"When you have an exceptional performance, especially a game like this, you're not happy. I've never liked being substituted either. But to be fair, I've never gone straight to the locker room afterward,\" Kroos said in his podcast about Vinicius's attitude toward the substitution. \n\nThe midfielder argues that only the player himself can assess Vinicius' emotions : \"You can always judge from the outside, but I like to keep in mind that, in reality, no one, except those who are there, in a Cl\u00e1sico and in front of 80,000 spectators with the score at 2-1, knows that you want anything but to leave. No one who judges it in the end can imagine that emotion. Or often. Most of those who judge it simply cannot put themselves in his place.\"\n\nBut Kroos, who must have seen Vinicius recover from a similar tantrum many times , also sends him a message: \"When he thinks calmly and with some distance, he'll probably think: 'Well, I can keep my anger to myself for a bit longer.' I can understand it, but as you can see in the photos, it doesn't seem ideal. However, I want to point out that it's an exceptional emotional situation when you're down there in a game like that.\" \n\nAnd he ends with a direct message to Real Madrid fans to not worry too much about what happened, because he believes that Xabi Alonso will not give the matter any importance : \"I have experienced it many times, so you don't always have to take everything so seriously. Coaches don't usually do that either. Especially those who were players.\"\n\nhttps://www.marca.com/futbol/real-madrid/2025/10/28/kroos-defiende-vinicius-le-deja-leccion-mi-tampoco-me-gusto-me-sustituyeran.html\n",
