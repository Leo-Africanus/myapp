And of course it's our academy reject Baba Diocou, who is having an incredible season - Cristian David mistimes a tackle on the right, the ball comes to Baba, who dribbles spectacularly in the box, breaking Joan's ankles, and finishes near post\n\n\u26bd 32' - 3:0, what are they doing? Corner for Arenas, and Pablo Garc\u00eda rises higher than Joan to head it into the net - absolutely tragic performance from Castilla so far\n\n39' - huge save from Mestre, Arenas could be 4 or 5:0 up here, absolutely inexcusable performance from the players and lineup from Arbeloa \n\n\u26bd 42' - GOLLLL DEL CASTILLA - Pol Fortuny can't reach a ball in the box, and it comes out to Aguado on the left wing instead - he puts in the cross to the bar post, where Y\u00e1\u00f1ez can somehow squeeze it into the net\n\n\u26bd 45' - come on... - tragic loss of possession by Cestero, and Baba Diocou plays an amazing outside of the boot pass to Vizcay - Lamini stumbles all over the place and can't intercept the pass or defend against Vizcay, and he takes a few touches and finishes for another easy goal\n\nHT - Speechless after this performance by Castilla, easily the worst half of this season and one of the worst I've ever seen by any Castilla team - too many experiments in the starting XI by Arbeloa today, and it's quite obvious some players like Liberto, Leiva, Lamini and Cristian David don't have the level for this competition... \n\n\ud83d\udd04 46' - only Valde for Lamini at the half\n\n\ud83d\udd04 59' - Mesonero for Pol Fortuny\n\n66' - first a great free kick by Mesonero that the goalkeeper can save spectacularly for a corner, then the ball falls to Liberto after the corner and the keeper can direct it to the post - then Castilla shoot again and complain for a handball, and the 4th shot finally goes over the bar \n\n70' - the handball is not given after a challenge - the images are bad, but I didn't see anything punishable either\n\n\ud83d\udd04 70' - Fortea for Cristian David - 25 minutes late, or maybe 70 tbh\n\n\ud83d\udd04 79' - Bruno Iglesias, back after injury, and Loren come on - Manuel \u00c1ngel and Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez off\n\n87' - Loren puts it in the back of the net, but he was offside \n\nFT - a much better second half, but without the necessary conviction in attack to actually make some corrections to the scoreline - the game was lost in the absolutely horrendous first half, the team finish the first half of the season in 4th, or can still drop down to 5th place\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 16:15 CET\n\n**Venue:** Campo Municipal de Gobela, Getxo\n\n**Referee**: \n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 1, Matchday 19\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[LaLiga+](https://www.laligaplus.laliga.com/) (subscription - 14.99\u20ac/month) (only available in Spain)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-3-3): Sergio Mestre - Liberto Navascu\u00e9s, Joan Mart\u00ednez, Lamini Fati (46' V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as 'Valde'), Cristian David (70' Jes\u00fas Fortea) - Jorge Cestero, Manuel \u00c1ngel (79' Bruno Iglesias), Pol Fortuny (59' Dani Mesonero) - Liberto Navascu\u00e9s, \u00c1lvaro Leiva, Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (79' Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga) \n\nBench: Javi Navarro (GK), Mario Rivas, Gabri Castrelo. \n\nUnavailable: Sergio Mestre (first team call-up), Manu Serrano (injury), David Jim\u00e9nez (first team call-up), Roberto Mart\u00edn (injury), Thiago Pitarch (first team call-up), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Bruno Iglesias (injury), C\u00e9sar Palacios (yellow card accumulation). \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** DWDLW\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 3rd | 31pt | 10-1-7 | 24:21\n",
