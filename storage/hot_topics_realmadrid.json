        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm a Turkish football fan and have been a Galatasaray supporter all my life. Apart from my club, I\u2019ve also followed Liverpool and, because of my father, had a soft spot for Bar\u00e7a for as long as I can remember. But things started to change when Arda G\u00fcler joined Real Madrid.\n\nAt first, when Arda moved to Fenerbah\u00e7e(our rival) which made me pretty upset. It felt like we\u2019d lost this incredible wonderkid, who has possibility to became the kind of classic number 10 you don\u2019t see much anymore. Still, I love football and I was happy to see such talent would represent our national team.\n\nBut then my man made the move to Real Madrid. Again, it made me a bit sad at first, another \u201crival\u201d team, in a way, but I couldn\u2019t help following him. Since he arrived, I haven\u2019t missed any of his minutes and watched most Real Madrid games over the last two years, always hoping to see him subbed on.\n\nSomewhere along the way, things changed. After Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s goal yesterday, I realized I was actually celebrating like a true Madrid fan. And when I think back to this year\u2019s El Cl\u00e1sico, I was genuinely upset after the loss.\n\nSo I guess it\u2019s official, after being a Gala fan, I can proudly say I\u2019ve become a Madridista. \ud83e\udd0d",
