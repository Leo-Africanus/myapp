        "content": "I know everyone is angry right now and honestly, that\u2019s the only right response. But we\u2019ve been here before. A few years ago, we were losing 4-0 to Barcelona and getting knocked out by teams like Ajax. Yet even then, at our lowest, we found a way to rebuild and come back stronger. Even at our worst, we won trophies because we adapted and evolved.\n\nThere\u2019s no point in commenting on other teams; what matters is that we, collectively, need to evolve again. Football has changed. Players today are so used to individual attention that they struggle to share the spotlight. But remember when we had Ronaldo, no one could have imagined anyone else from our team winning a Ballon d\u2019Or. Yet we produced not just one, but two different Ballon d\u2019Or winners after him. It\u2019s not about individual awards they never mattered much to me it\u2019s about what they represented: the strength of the team. Our trophy cabinet didn\u2019t grow because of individual brilliance alone; it grew because we played for each other.\n\nFootball has evolved, and the people who need to understand that the most are the ones managing the club the board and the decision makers.\n\nThe part that hurts the most when I watch our matches today is this, the soul of the team I once supported feels lost. There\u2019s no passion, no mentality just wannabe Instagram stars and crybabies. Players lose the ball and stay down waiting for a foul instead of fighting to win it back. That\u2019s not the Real Madrid way.\n\nWe need leadership someone who can bring these kids back in line, or, frankly, some people need to leave.\n\nRegardless, I\u2019ll always support the badge. But this? This is not the level, nor the spirit, of Real Madrid.\n\nWe will bounce back, that\u2019s for sure. \n\nHala Madrid!! ",

        "content": "This isn't a post defending Rodrygo. I'm just bringing up his case as a perfect example of how lot of fans dramatically change their mind within the span of few weeks, sometimes just one week.\n\nRight after we lost the against Arsenal in El Bernabeu, Marca asked people to  \nvote which players should leave this summer. I'll paste here the most relevant part and I'll provide the link for those who want to read it:\n\n\\&gt;The question was simple, but forceful (Which players should leave in the summer?)... and the answer couldn't have been more direct  \n\\[.......\\]  \n**&gt;Jes\u00fas Vallejo** received 12% of the votes \\[...\\] He narrowly surpassed (11%) **Lucas V\u00e1zquez**, \\[...\\] The list of culprits is long and sharp. **Alaba followed closely (10%), then Ancelotti and Mendy (9%)... before surprisingly reaching Vinicius (63,000 votes).**  \n\\[.......\\]  \n**&gt;As things stand, Courtois gets the best grade of all (7.16) and Vallejo the worst (3.19). In total, 14 players passed (Courtois, Valverde, Asensio, Bellingham, R\u00fcdiger, Brahim, Ceballos, Lunin, Modric, Mbapp\u00e9, Carvajal, Endrick, Rodrygo, and Camavinga) and 10 failed (the rest of the squad and Ancelotti).**\n\n  \nLink: [https://www.marca.com/futbol/real-madrid/2025/04/18/aficion-mira-palco-exige-dos-fichajes-venderia-vinicius-verano.html](https://www.marca.com/futbol/real-madrid/2025/04/18/aficion-mira-palco-exige-dos-fichajes-venderia-vinicius-verano.html)\n\nThat was only 1 week ago. The votes were pretty much in line with what many people was saying on this sub after that game.\n\nThose with good memory should remember how for most part of the season how many people used to name Tchouameni as a player who should be sold, and Vinicius (best of the world last season according to most fans) was very often mentioned as a player an attacker that should be sold.\n\nRodrygo or Mbappe were barely mentioned if someone asked if any of our attackers should leave.\n\nFast forward two weeks and nobody thinks Tchouameni should leave, almost nobody mentions Viniciuys should leave but lot of people think Rodrygo should.\n\nNow some will claim that they never asked for Vinicius to be sold but they always asked Rodrygo to be sold. Well, maybe you in particular didn't but the facts are there. If are one of those who claims this or the other certified great player should be sold then I don't believe you, and if you think Rodrygo isn't a great player (despite his performance this season) then I'm sorry but I gotta laugh at how little you understand this team sport.",

        "content": "I know he could shot a bit stronger but doesn't matter, Brahim takes too much time i understand it is what it is I'm not gonna say Brahim is bad player for this or Modric, but in  terms of just football.   \nBrahim Takes too long to understand the situation.   \nI don't think Modric has better variant to pass , back pass  would be more dangerous , Brahim should look at Modric at that situation and  wait for his pass cuz he got no options to pass Penalty box pass would be really dangerous , Right pass would be dangerous too cuz another Barca Player was running too right side.  \nLets hope we will win in May 11.   \n",

        "content": "What hurts me most is not the results but the teams antics. They blame everyone but themselves. \n\nI am so fed up with Vini's behaviour. I am tired of Rudiger's temper, Carvajal and Lucas Vazquez as seniors are acting like children and Jude needs to not follow Vini's path. \n\nCarlo is known to always have been this chill manager that lets players do whatever they want. \n\nWe need a no nonsense manager. We saw how Arteta demanded respect and inlisted discipline into his players. Flick has shown that he can be a friend to his players and take no nonesense. \n\nI really hope Xabi is a manager that takes no bullshit. I dont care who you are, if you are lacking disciple, u need to get benched. \n\n\nI honestly love how Mbappe is coolheaded. Aside from that red card incident, i feel that he is not involving himself in these antics from our other players.",

        "title": "Rodrygo is way too inconsistent and forces us into a 4-3-3.",
        "content": "So lets look at the stats, lets start with last season, because thats when i started having problems with Rodrygo.\n\nSo if we focus specifically on the league, lets start with last season\n\n23/24:\n\nBetween gameday 1, and gameday 12, or essentially three months, Rodrygo scored 1 goal, and got 1 assist.\n\nThen after that, between gameday 13 and gameday 17, almost two months, he scored 6 goals and got 3 assists.\n\nThen after that, for the reason of the season, in 20 games, he got 3 goals, and 1 assist.\n\nAnd now in this current 24/25 season:\n\nBetween matchday 1 and matchday 16, almost 4 months, Rodrygo got 3 goals and 1 assist. (He did miss 3 games due to injury)\n\nThen once again in around december, he went crazy, between matchday 17 and 21, he scored 3 goals and assisted 5.\n\nThat was in January, and now we're almost in may, and Rodrygo hasn't scored or assisted a single goal in the league since. Obviously there has been goals or assists in the CL, but if we're just looking at the league, this isn't good at all.\n\nIm really tired of this narrative of how he's played out of position and all that, if he can't adapt to the right wing, then he's gonna have to be benched, or sold, because he just isn't better than Vini on the left, even though this sub probably has a hateboner for Vini right now because he didn't play very well in the final, i think if we're being objective, Vini is a better left winger than Rodrygo is. Having Rodrygo and Lucas Vazquez on the same flank feels fucking horrible, and its not really surprise to me that the moment both of these players were subbed off for Kylian and Arda/Modric, that we started playing infinitely better yesterday, we were actually able to carry the ball forward from defence.\n\nI love Rodrygo, he's one of those unhateable players, everyone loves Rodrygo, but he is painfully inconsistent, i still remember all those edits from before this season about how the force of Kylian/Jude/Vini/Rodrygo would be unstoppable, and i always thought ''Why the fuck is Rodrygo included in that conversation with 3 greats?'' I really fail to see why we have to change our entire formation into a 4-3-3 just so that Rodrygo can fit in on the right wing, when he hasn't really done anything to deserve us changing from our best formation, which would be with Vini and Kylian up top with Jude behind them, then Tchou+Fede with Luka/Cama/Dani/Arda as the 3 behind Jude.",
