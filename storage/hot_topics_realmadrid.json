But that didn't change my idea, which was always to retire like this, and luckily I've managed it. I think it's difficult to do better than I did in my last season with Real Madrid. I left after winning La Liga and the Champions League. Adi\u00f3s.\"\n\nThe best thing is to leave at the very top. You walk away with a great feeling because you\u2019re the one who made the decision. And before someone sent me to the bench because I wasn\u2019t as good anymore or because I wasn\u2019t as important to the team as I was right up to the end. I preferred to be the one to step away.

        "content": "I know this might sound unpopular, but hear me out. I\u2019ve followed Real Madrid for a long time. I remember watching Iker Casillas make his debut at 18 against Athletic Bilbao. He was a legend, no doubt. Amazing reflexes, clutch saves, a symbol of the club.\n\nBut if we\u2019re being honest, Casillas had flaws too. He was shaky at times, especially on crosses and aerial balls. That\u2019s one of the reasons why he eventually lost his place to Diego L\u00f3pez around the age of 31.\n\nNow look at Courtois.\n\nSince he joined Real Madrid, he completely owned the number one spot. Nobody questioned it. Not even Keylor Navas, who had great moments and made big saves, could truly challenge him. But Keylor also had weaknesses, especially when it came to dealing with high balls and staying consistent.\n\nCourtois brings something different. He\u2019s calm, dominant in the air, and shows up in big matches. Just think about the Champions League final in Paris. That performance wasn\u2019t just good, it was historic.\n\nEven now, despite his age and the time missed due to injury, nobody is seriously thinking about replacing him. That level of trust says a lot.\n\nIn my opinion, Courtois is the most complete and consistent goalkeeper we\u2019ve had in modern Real Madrid history. Not trying to erase what Casillas did. But based on what I\u2019ve seen, Courtois is that guy.",

        "title": "Xabi Alonso and the Non-Negotiable Work Rate: Will Mbappe or Vini Jr. Face the Bench?",
        "content": "Alright Madristas,\n\nLet's talk about the burning question at Real Madrid under Xabi Alonso: Will he actually bench Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 or Vinicius Jr. if they don't consistently track back and contribute defensively?\n\nWe've all seen the dazzling runs, the insane goals, the moments of pure individual brilliance from these two. But for years, a common criticism, especially of Mbapp\u00e9 at PSG and at times Vini Jr. under Ancelotti, has been their perceived lack of defensive involvement. With Alonso now at the helm, a manager who built a historically disciplined, high-work-rate Bayer Leverkusen side, this issue is amplified.\n\nAlonso's philosophy is crystal clear. He has repeatedly stressed the importance of a collective defensive effort, stating, \"In my view, we ALL have to defend. The 11 players have to press. Vinicius Jr, Jude, Fede Valverde, Mbapp\u00e9. All of them.\" This isn't just lip service; his Leverkusen team operated with an intense, synchronized press and positional discipline that was instrumental to their unbeaten season.\n\nLooking at last season, particularly in the recent Club World Cup semifinal loss to PSG, reports surfaced about Alonso holding \"crunch talks\" with both Mbapp\u00e9 and Vini Jr. regarding their on-field attitudes and defensive work rate. While Mbapp\u00e9's illness might have played a role, the sentiment from the club hierarchy, as reported by Marca, was a concern over the team's lack of fluency and failure to work together defensively, stemming from an alleged lack of effort from the attacking duo.\n\nWe saw glimpses of Vini Jr. putting in more defensive shifts under Ancelotti at times, but it was often inconsistent. Mbapp\u00e9, on the other hand, has a well-documented history of conserving energy for attacking exploits.\n\nSo, the question is: are these world-class talents truly \"non-negotiable\" in Alonso's system, even if their defensive contributions don't meet his rigorous standards? Or will the sheer offensive output outweigh the defensive compromises? Leverkusen's success was built on a strong collective, not just individual brilliance.\nWhat do you all think? Has Xabi Alonso shown enough resolve at Leverkusen to suggest he'd make such a drastic call? Or are Mbapp\u00e9 and Vini Jr. simply too important to ever be benched, forcing Alonso to adapt his system around them? \n",

        "content": "I didn\u2019t really get to watch Gareth Bale play live during his time at Real Madrid, but I always hear mixed opinions about him. Some fans say he was world-class and scored in the biggest moments, while others say he didn\u2019t live up to his potential or wasn\u2019t consistent enough. I know he scored that insane Copa del Rey goal vs Barcelona and the bicycle kick in the UCL final, but I want to know more. What was Bale like in his prime? How important was he to the team when Ronaldo was around? Did injuries really hold him back that much, or was he underrated overall? Would love to hear your thoughts and memories\u2014both the good and the bad.",

I would be flying with the team on and off.  I\u2019m genuinely excited about the possibility and I\u2019ve gone through a lot of rough times waiting for a moment like this. Let\u2019s see what happens. Hala Madrid!",

        "content": "Yeah the PSG game he and the team were trash and also he needs to work on his physicality and defensive work but the thing is the kids passing range is amazing I would say he is by far one of the best if not the best passer in our team right now and also his vision is also amazing and the fact that the kid is willing to press and get into duels is a plus point.\n\nBut one thing is players like these peak later but their longevity is longer for example Kroos became a world class deep lying playmaker at age 25-26 modric became 29-30 and Pirlo was at the later stages of his career so I think we should put our faith on the kid and let him grow in this role.\n\nAnd besides he did very good In that role even though it was his first time playing so deep",
