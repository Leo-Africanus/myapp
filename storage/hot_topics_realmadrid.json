        "content": "We scored from a quick counter attach to make it 2-0 today and saw comment spamming the same bs of \"no tactics, all individual brilliance on that goal\". \n\nLike when dafuq has this goofy idea spread so hard in this sub to the point we can't even celebrate goals in Match Thread without some edgy keyboard warriors spamming \"individual brilliance\".\n\nApparently it's a cardinal sin for a team to exploit their player's best attributes.\n\nFede got a canon of a foot ... but got forbid we makes plays that allows him to exploit it. Like from the multiple set piece routines he scored from this season. Mbappe, Vini nor Rodrygo aren't allowed to use their exceptional dribbling skills and pace in order to create and score goals. \n\nSo wtf type of goals are we allowed to score then ? Every player needs to touch the ball at least twice during that play ? A minimum of 20-30-40 passes ? And the final 5 players needs to do everything in 1 touch ?\n\nNo seriously, enlighten me ? This whole idea that football needs to be played that one way ( positional with robotic patterns and hyper pressing ) can't die soon enough. I swear.",

Also is there any such history between us of helping out?\n\nOr it's just the plain and simple obvious of Xabi Alonso requesting the club.\n\nHave we had any such examples of helping out other foreign clubs?",
