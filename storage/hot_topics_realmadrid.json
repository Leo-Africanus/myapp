        "content": "I\u2019ve been pretty invested in the Negreira case and all of the registration issues. Simply because I think the fans deserve to see a fair competition, regardless of which team is better. I\u2019ve also been invested because I was tired of the media misconception that Madrid is involved in this \u201ccorruption\u201d without any proper facts provided. However, I\u2019ve noticed that the board does absolutely nothing about any of this. It seems that they don\u2019t care about Laporta dragging down Madrid and this beautiful institution. Which brings me to my next point, it\u2019s clear that Florentino only cares about the super league. Yes, we see referee videos every week (Absurd) but when it comes to actually doing something like filing complains to La Liga or demanding proper answers, nothing is done. Absolutely nothing. It\u2019s a bit sad to see fans want to demand 1) Honesty in the competition 2) Respect for this institution while the board seems to have 0 interest in any of this. \n\nJust to be clear, I\u2019m not demanding that the board respond to FCBJOHN on Twitter. No, I\u2019m asking the board to actually be invested in these court cases and demand answers/look for proper punishment. We literally lost the league 2 seasons ago because Barca provided fake accounting documents to register Gundogan and Lewa. It\u2019s directly detrimental to our success. And I think the referee videos are a disgrace. All they do is wine up the fans while the board sits back and does nothing where it matters.",
