We need the 3 points tomorrow to secure the top 8.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Alvaro Arbeloa: \u201cIt\u2019s an honour  to hear Coach Mourinho\u2019s kind words about me. He means a lot more to me than just a coach. It made me emotional and happy to hear him. He\u2019s my friend.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Alvaro Arbeloa: \u201cWhen I was a player, we used to put on Mourinho\u2019s press conferences in the locker room and listen to them.\n\nI didn\u2019t miss his conferences back then, and I didn\u2019t miss today\u2019s conference either.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Alvaro Arbeloa: \u201cThe new Mourinho? There will never be another Mourinho.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Alvaro Arbeloa: \u201cMourinho keeps changing his phone number. We stayed in contact, but of course I try not to annoy him and keep calling him.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Alvaro Arbeloa: \u201cThe team showing a better attitude on the pitch? From what I\u2019ve seen since I\u2019ve been here, the squad is perfectly ready to sacrifice and work hard and do everything to win. Of course we can do much better, but we need time and work and training.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Alvaro Arbeloa: \u201cThese players deserve a lot of credit for how well they\u2019re playing right now, under a new coach with so little time to train.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Alvaro Arbeloa: \u201cJude Bellingham is INCREDIBLE. He\u2019s an incredible player, but he\u2019s also a guy who wants to be a leader, he runs, he works hard.\n\nHis level in training, his committment, it\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s an honour for me to coach Jude Bellingham.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Alvaro Arbeloa: \u201cThe 2014 CL final in this stadium marked the beginning of a glorious era.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Alvaro Arbeloa: \u201cA few days ago, 48 hours after a game, I went to Jude Bellingham, and I told him \u201cJude, stop running so much.\u201d He doesn\u2019t stop running, it\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Alvaro Arbeloa:\u201cArda is a very young boy, he is working a lot. He finishes the games very tired due to the defensive involvement, but it helps us a lot.We want to take advantage of his talent, one that can shine closer to the pivot or the strikers.In all these situations, you must continue to grow. And when the games of maximum demand arrive, he will surely help us.\u201c",

        "content": "I think mastuono, despite his huge signing fees, is not talked enough as a youngster(mentioned signing fees because with huge fees you get more attention). For instance, he has similar or better stats than Yamal had in the first 15 games. Maybe Yamal was younger than him so we can't really compare them. Arda was the talk of football community when he signed with us, his age-18 was the highlight. Mastuono being of similar age, I don't really see him getting similar fame others before him got.\n\nAnd, I personally feel he's the proper right winger we've got since Gareth bale, a left footed right winger. Like we also had rodrygo and he was nice on the right, but him being right footed always had us lacking something during games. Mastantuono helps in so much ways, creates a balance on both sides while attacking. He runs, presses, tracks back, passes perfectly,...RUNS. Maybe he runs too much at times, but he doesn't look under confident on the pitch, and the number of fck ups are quite negligible by him.\n\nI feel like we don't talk about him enough like we did about Arda or huijsen. Or even the football media don't talk about him enough like they did with the likes of Yamal or cubarsi or pedri, etc.",
