It\u2019s funny how many liked to claim that he had \u201cno tactics\u201d. Then we got a tactics coach in Xabi and he did not even last a full season. Ancelotti always knew what he was doing and how to manage the locker room. The more time goes on, the more I appreciate and understand his way of thinking. The only reasonable flaw I see in him is his tendency to not play youth players. Besides that, he always knew how to manage the team and how to adapt to the players. ",

        "content": "Hi Madridistas,\n\nI\u2019ve spent the last few weeks building an Interactive LaLiga Simulator that includes a Dynamic All-Time Historical Table (ranking every team since 1929).\n\nI was testing some scenarios today and the data is impressive: Even in the wildest \"comeback\" scenarios for other teams, Real Madrid\u2019s lead in the historical standings is massive. I wanted to build something that would let you see exactly how this season\u2019s points contribute to Madrid\u00b4s overall history.\n\nWhat can you do with the tool?\n\n* **Simulate the rest of the season**: Enter your predicted scores for every remaining match.\n* **Real-Time Historical Impact:** Your predictions for this season are added instantly to the All-Time Table. You can see how many more points Madrid need to reach a specific lead over the 2nd place.\n* **Goal Records:** Keep track of Goal Difference (GD) and Goals For (GF) to see how the current squad compares to historical records.\n* **Segunda Divisi\u00f3n:** I\u2019ve also added the second tier for those interested in seeing which historic clubs might be promoted next season.\n\n**The \"Challenge\":** Can Madrid reach a lead of more than 100 points over the 2nd place in the historical table by the end of this season? I\u2019ve tried a few simulations and it looks like you are on track for a legendary gap.\n\nCheck it out here: [https://calculafutbol.com/](https://calculafutbol.com/)\n\nI\u2019m a solo developer and a football fan, so I\u2019d love to get your feedback on the tool, the UI, or if you think I should add more historical stats (like total titles or win percentages).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dv7yxu1fimkg1.png?width=1416&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4752a8ac9ab70ffc4f8029eeb4327cc6f75fc53f\n\n",
