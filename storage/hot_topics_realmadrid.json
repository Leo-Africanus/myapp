        "content": "   I think at this point it has to be obvious that Mbappe is not a striker. So many people are so sure that Mbappe can play striker well and just has to learn. However, I think after so much, it is obvious he is not built for that. If you look at his way of playing, always shifts to the laterals of the pitch and plays deeper. If anything, he is more of a false 9, but without the playmaking qualities. I will keep saying it, we are wasting Mbappe by forcing him to play striker. Anyone who claims that he scores, yes he does, because he is Mbappe. Put him anywhere and he will deliver because he is world class, but that is not his best position for him or the team. The amount of times I see a beautiful play just for no one to be in the box is insane. For some reason Mbappe avoids the box as much as possible. I do not know how you would arrange the players after, but I would try Mbappe on the wing for at least one match. If you want to try stuff so much, then play your young prospects who are both strikers! Try playing Gonzalo on less important matches, play Mbappe on the wing for a couple matches, put Endrick, etc. I don\u2019t understand this fixedness on keeping Mbappe as a number nine. When we played the CWC we were doing pretty well because we had a proper 9. Unless we get one, we will keep doing bad. ",

        "content": "Someone recently posted a graphic on this sub, which showed 5 players in the 23/24 season had 10+ goals (Jude, Vini, Rodrygo, Joselu, and motherfucking Brahim Diaz). \n\nLet's look at how our current attack is faring in the league as we near the end of the first half of the season: \n\n\\- Mbappe: 13 goals (hip hip hooray for the Mbappe fanboys)\n\n\\- Vini: 5 goals (surprised to see him in 2nd place given his inconsistent form)\n\n\\- Guler: 3 goals\n\n\\- Jude: 2 goals (lol, how the fuck is Jude 4th on the list when he pretty much just came back from surgery). \n\nThree other players have 1 goal each, and literally everyone else has a big fat ZERO, including Valverde, Camavinga, and Rodrygo. This begs the question: how the fuck did we go from being a well-balanced attack with 5 players bagging 10+ goals to basically Mbappe FC? Losing Kroos was a big blow, but there's no way one player's departure can lead to such a drastic difference in the attack. \n\nIt also raises another question, why the fuck can't our midfield and defense help out the attack? I'm not expecting prime Ramos numbers, but fuck me, this is dismal. \n\n",

        "content": "We all saw that the moment he came on he pressed by dropping below several times. Also the sequence where jude bellingham lofted a ball to him in the box which he wasn't able to head properly but that was still our best chance in god know how many minute. I get it he is not that good considering our level and all but he for sure add a lot of balance to the team. He nearly won us the game and the sequence in which mbappe passed to camavinga who later cross it to gonzalo was so simple i reckon we can do it with carreras + vini or mbappe with gonzalo crash the box. Yesderstay trent crossed so well so it would be nice to see some good aerial threat in the box as we all saw how trent hesitated to cross when mbappe was in the box the only time he did it inaki pena saved it. So yeah that was pretty good chance if we can do it 5 times every game then atleast there will be one goal by just simple sequence. Our attack is too predictable and i hate the way kylian postioned himself during counter. I can show you 3 sequence where we could have easily created 3v4 situation in our favour if mbappe made a inside run but we always drift away from the defensive line of the opponent. This was very important game and we shouldn't have made so many rotation as we could have done something more creative in first half but it is what it is we went from having 5 point gap to 1 and its not looking good. Hope we play mbappe rw because he always perform good there and vini can have more freedom at lw. I'm very eager to see vini and carreras crossing it to gonzalo. As i said he is not that elite striker but if we don't give him minute he won't improve and he surely got a potential to be elite striker ",

        "content": "We can see from all the threads and match details that something has to improve, and not only Xabi's tactics but also our squad imbalance contributed to all of this situation.\n\nDefense: Nacho left, and no player is around to completely fill his absence. We got one CB Huijsen but he's an entirely different type of player. We need 3 fit CBs according to Xabi's tactics, but injury crisis in the defence forces him to play Fran / Mendy on the LM which is not ideal at all. Carvajal &amp; Trent's injury forces Valverde to play on RB which he clearly doesn't like and is very likely to give him more injuries. Even if Trent is fit, it's clear that we need Carvajal's replacement in 2 years.\n\nMidfield: We never got Kroos' replacement even after we had stinker season which we clearly saw how much his absence had an impact on our game, and Modric leaving didn't help at all. Now pretty much we are seeking majority of our creativity from Arda and he's way much natural at #10, clearly not a #8.\n\nAttack: The front 3 dilemma is getting clearly concerning considering our imbalance in goal scorers and how our attackers are performing. If we sign a #9, Vini or Mbappe has to benched or either play on the right, which none of the both will prefer. \nRodrygo is arguably having the worst time of his career and is on the path of becoming the worst player in the squad if this performance keeps on continuing. Gonzalo &amp; Endrick aren't getting the game time they actually deserve, and spending most of the time on the bench (especially Endrick).\n\nGK: I love you Thiabaut &amp; Lunin\n\nAlso in general\n\n\u2022\t\u2060No clear aerial threats at the front\n\u2022\t\u2060All veterans / leadership figures left in the past 3 years\n\nJust listed some problems that I can see directly, what do you guys think that should be the priority next transfer window?",

This is not anything new and it doesn't indicate anything when it comes to vini's feelings about the club. Also Jose felix diaz said vini is close to renewal ( he's not a great source but I'm just saying).",

        "content": "He doesn't have the vision and the release of a Number 10. He kills every attacking build up with unnecessary slow motion ball hogging. He is a tackler, a ball shielder,  a Khedira that should stay much further behind. He has no chemistry with anyone, not here, not in England. Don't care who plays just get him off the Number 10 position. Put Gonzalo Garcia for headers and Mbappe as LF. But as long as Bellingham keeps playing number 10 , we won't win anything. See the same story repeating against Olympiakos and Girona and come back to this thread. \n",

By no means am I expecting to be up by 11 points in the league but when is enough enough for us to question his job? ",

        "content": "Both the LW and the RW are black holes where every attack goes to die. Every inch of the decision making made from both the wings hurt our team. The RW doesn't exist and the LW plays in his own time zone disconnected with any other player on the outfield. Teenage fullbacks have their career best performances against our wingers. Teams have their pressure release valve when our wingers have the ball. \nThey don't make runs, They don't make one twos, They don't release the through balls, They ignore all the overlapping runs made by the fullbacks. They are still BABYied by our managers. They still want freedom. \n\nAnd then people pile on shit on our midfielders for not creating enough. Create for who? ",
