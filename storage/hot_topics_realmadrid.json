Also considering the scenario in which rodrygo stays that means endrick could possibly get less minutes than last season since we might be playing with 2 attackers. It's really sad to see honestly because endrick is better than gonzalo (except for aerial ability) and has the potential to be insane, he literally saved us in the copa del rey and had 5 goals in 5 games",

        "content": "Can someone please explain to me why we let Zubimendi get past us? I understand the 60 Million was pretty high but considering today's market, I am struggling to understand the reasoning behind this. \n\nLast season we really struggled to play the ball from the back ESPECIALLY from the center circle of the pitch. This season without Modric (who arguably created the most \"futbol\" through the middle for us), a Ceballos who does not seem to convince Xabi, and Tchouameni/Camavinga who are most likely to have a stronger presence in defence and perhaps in quick counters, I am struggling to see how we have a squad strong enough for this upcoming season.\n\nEven with Zubimendi gone, this honestly feels like another negligent window. We needed a Zubimendi and a creative midfielder BADLY. We have NONE OF THOSE.\n\nI am not one for ringing the alarm bells without reason but I hope this team and president back this manager because he deserves it.",

With Chelsea won FIFA Club World Cup 2025 and they become world clampions, do you think Chelsea now is the best club in the world? being above Real Madrid?   \nI'm a madridista since 2013, but I felt like a little disappointed that Madrid didn't win CWC :(   \nBut how about you guys?   \nThanks before :) ",

        "content": "I understand why people may think we need one but let's be real here, if this team can't control games or dominate the midfield with the players we have then everyone should go to Saudi and call it quits. There are so many teams with worse midfielders than ours yet they still manage to dominate the midfield and you're telling me we can't do that with Tchou, Cama, Fede, Jude, Guler, etc? Getting a creative midfielder isn't gonna change anything, the tactics are the biggest issue and that's why Alonso is here ( no disrespect to Carlo but he lost the plot last season). At the end of the day these players aren't robots, they're insanely talented and can learn to play in any way that Xabi deems necessary.",
