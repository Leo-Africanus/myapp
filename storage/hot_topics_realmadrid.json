A potential foul afterwards in the box is challenged for review by Arbeloa\n\n90'+2 - after a very long review, the ref decides no penalty\n\n\ud83d\udfe5 90'+6 - second yellow for Lamini who makes a stupid and unnecessary tactical foul while already on a yellow \n\nFT - a decent second half is too little after league leaders Tenerife had already decided the match in the first. A 1-3 loss against what is clearly the best team in the division is normally no shame, but with now 4 losses in a row and multiple players missing the next weeks due to the U20 World Cup + Fettal injured and Lamini now suspended, the situation is looking extremely dire and hopeless for Arbeloa's team.

Fede just offers nothing he doesn\u2019t try building up play or receiving the ball and moving it around. Maybe trying a few games with cama or ceballos as the pivot could help see what problems this team has and fix things. I know ceballos is good at maintaining possession, and cama likes to move around and move the ball with him while also offering other stuff. I don\u2019t want to overreact to a derby game since this is how stuff usually goes with Atletico. But it\u2019s just a thought.",

Especially it make Valverde worse, he and Jude shouldn't be starting together. \n\nNot sure why didn't he sub off them and put Ceballos+Camavanga on in the 2nd half, Guler shouldn't be the one to sub out.",

Our defenders are way too soft, way too malnourished, way too unsure that's why they were getting bullied by Atleti. We need a strong presence at the back, a Ramos type figure, who may be hated by the world, but will marshall the back 4, with plan, respect, physical presence and heart. We also need better physical and intelligence in midfield. The hole that was opened after Kroos going away, isn't filled yet, maybe Gueller will fill that in time, but till then, we need a Casemiro to sweep up the mistakes made by the midfield. \n\nToday I think that I can't really find Vini and Mbappe at fault, if we are leaking 5 at the back, our attack line up just can't get enough balls, confidence or ideas to beat opposition defense. Attack starts from defence and today, it was proven yet again, our back is absolutely killing us. Sadly it reminded me the era of Zidanes and Pavons.. Pavon was never good enough, this back 4 isn't either. ",

Here are my thoughts on where Xabi slipped up:\n\n1. **Jude starting** \u2013 Should\u2019ve been used as a super sub. His impact off the bench could\u2019ve flipped the game.\n2. **Arda being subbed off** \u2013 Huge mistake. The kid is our main playmaker, and pulling him killed our creative spark.\n3. **Aerial weakness** \u2013 With R\u00fcdiger out, we had no presence in the air. Against Atleti, that\u2019s a recipe for disaster.\n4. **Vini vs Rodrygo** \u2013 Rodrygo\u2019s scoring record against Atleti speaks for itself. He should\u2019ve replaced Vini.\n5. **Inexperience** \u2013 Dean, Carreras and others still don\u2019t fully grasp the intensity and tactical grind of a derby. It showed.\n\nBut here\u2019s the silver lining: this loss might be the best thing for us. The players won\u2019t get carried away with confidence, and it gives them a reason to dig deeper, fight harder, and sharpen up before Barca. Better to take this lesson now than be exposed later.\n\nThe future still looks exciting. We\u2019ve got a young core, a coach who\u2019s learning, and a squad that will only get better from here.",

        "content": "I'm going to try not be reactionary but my word that was dreadful.\n\n*Bad Start*: We looked out of sorts for majority of the game (bar that 10-15 minute spell in the first half where we equalised &amp; lead) &amp; it's somewhat been coming. In some our earlier games this season we have looked lacklustre in defence &amp; chasing back/clearing balls when we lose them &amp; have been saved by moments of brilliance (Carreras vs Mallorca) or the opposition being dog shit.\n\nMistakes: Dean's potential is limitless &amp; I think he'll be a great player but I think we crowned him too early. He's made a few costly mistakes this season &amp; yesterday he was exposed. He's what? Almost 2m tall but he can't win aerial duels? That's pathetic. Carreras almost got sent off &amp; he also didn't look like he was up to the occasion.\n\nSelection: Not sure what Xabi's thinking was with starting both Jude &amp; Arda especially when Jude hadn't played 90 total minutes especially when Franco was right there coming off a good game midweek. Jude looked invisible out there, if there was a game to get him up to speed, it should've been midweek (I know hindsight is 20/20). He should've made better subs in the 70th-75th minute when it was clear that trying neat dribbles into the box wasn't working &amp; try something different with Gonzalo. \n\n\nConclusion: I'm really hoping it's a one off because of the occasion but the two times we've played \"decent\" teams we've been embarrassed, it's not filling me with confidence especially with the schedule coming. I trust Xabi to turn it around but that should not happen again. Hopefully the players actually show up next time. ",
