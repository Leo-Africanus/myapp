Against Tunisia he got 34 accurate passes (97%), 5 duels won, 1 tackle won, rated 7.6. \n\nWe have 2 world class LWs in Vini and Rodrygo. No reason to just let one rot in the bench when there's plenty of opportunity to let both play, especially when Vini is inconsistent in his performances these days. Competition breeds improvement. We have to encourage it.\n\nAlso Gonzalo Garcia scored against Romania. He's a talented striker with good positioning &amp; he's a better aerial threat than most of our players. We should be subbing him in at the 70th minute or so if Mbappe isn't performing, or against low blocks, where we could use a conventional #9 to cross to.",

        "content": "Diario AS: Benzema: \"Return to Real Madrid? If Florentino is still there, it's possible\" | Karim Benzema remains an idol at the Bernab\u00e9u, where his memory is indelible, and he sat down with AS for an exclusive interview. \n\nFrom Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz \n\nFull Writeup: \n\n**Karim Benzema welcomed**\u00a0***AS***\u00a0**to Al Ittihad\u2019s training complex in Jeddah.** Ahead was a long, relaxed conversation with the leader of the reigning Saudi Pro League and cup champions. When he signed his contract \u2013 which runs until June 30 next year \u2013 he promised to take the team to the top. He has delivered. \n\nNow comes the moment to talk and make decisions, because one thing the former Real Madrid striker is sure of is that he wants to keep playing.**\u201cI\u2019m 38. I feel good and motivated to keep going for two more years,\u201d**\u00a0the Frenchman says, and so much more... \n\n**How is life here in Jeddah?** \n\n\u201cVery good, normal, like in Madrid. I really like the country. It opens up more every year and more people come. I think that\u2019s very important for Jeddah and for Saudi Arabia. It\u2019s not just football \u2013 there are good restaurants, beaches, plenty to do.\" \n\n**What does Saudi Arabia mean to Karim Benzema? Let\u2019s not forget that along with Cristiano Ronaldo, you helped set a trend in Saudi football\u2026** \n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia needs players like Cristiano, like me, like others who\u2019ve come to bring them some of what we have in Europe. We have to show the kids here what it takes so they can move to other clubs. It\u2019s a country that\u2019s opening up. People are very respectful day to day. It\u2019s a very good place for me.\u201d \n\n**League, Cup \u2013 you\u2019ve made history with Al Ittihad.** \n\n\u201cYes, I think this club likes that, pushing itself. It has that mentality of doing beautiful things in football. The fans are incredible \u2013 every match they\u2019re there, home or away. That\u2019s very important for us. Last year we won the King Cup and the league. It was a very good moment, a special one for everyone.\" \n\n**Do you feel like the leader of the team?** \n\n\u201cI\u2019m here for that, but always to help my teammates. If I\u2019m at my best, it\u2019s because they allow me to be at my best. Scoring goals is the job of all of us. I can help them with advice on or off the pitch, help them improve and maybe one day move to other teams as well.\u201d \n\n**Do you feel valued?** \n\n\u201cYes, a lot. When I signed I had just won the Ballon d\u2019Or. It wasn\u2019t the end of my career \u2013 I wanted to play, keep playing and enjoy football. I feel very good in this club. The fans are great, the boys want to work. Those are things I really appreciate every day.\" \n\n**And the fans? What are they like?** \n\n\u201cI feel very appreciated by them. You feel it in every stadium. They\u2019re always with you. They give you confidence.\u201d \n\n**After so many years at the top, do you still have goals?** \n\n\u201cTo keep scoring, playing, creating plays, giving people emotion. Not just in Saudi Arabia but in the whole football world. Every time I step on the pitch, I want people to feel that. I like doing special things even in training.\u201d \n\n**Zidane is being mentioned as the next France coach\u2026** \n\n\u201cI think he has everything to be there. He proved it at Real Madrid. There\u2019s another coach now, but in my view Zizou is number one.\u201d \n\n**Would Benzema return to the French national team?** \n\n\u201cThe national team feels a bit far away, but you never know. I focus on what I have now. \n\n**Time passes; you\u2019re approaching three years away from Real Madrid. Is it still your team?** \n\n\u201cIt will always be my team. I still watch games when I can. It\u2019s the best club in the world. It always has been and always will be. It\u2019s a team with huge potential and I think it can do more than it\u2019s doing right now.\u201d \n\n**More? In what sense?** \n\n\u201cI like this Real Madrid. There\u2019s always talk, but that\u2019s how it is. If they draw or lose, it\u2019s suddenly a crisis. They go from being the best team in the world to questioning the coach, this player, that one\u2026 it\u2019s normal because it\u2019s the best club in the world. But I like this team.\" \n\n**You shared a dressing room with Xabi Alonso. Did you see the coach in him back then?**\n\n\u201cI remember him then the same as now as a coach. Pressure, vertical passes\u2026 a style I like. He\u2019s only been coaching six months and he\u2019s doing very well. Give him time.\" \n\n**Will we see Karim Benzema as a coach one day?** \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I have friends who are already doing coaching badges and always talk to me about it, but it\u2019s hard. Footballer or coach seems different, but the pressure is the same. It\u2019s complicated.\u201d \n\n**This is a Real Madrid without Kroos, Modric, Casemiro, Ramos, Benzema\u2026 a team that once seemed eternal.** \n\n\u201cTrue, it seemed eternal. Many great players. Football now is different, it\u2019s something else. There\u2019s no point comparing. Today\u2019s Real Madrid may have more of some things, but it lacks a leader \u2013 though sometimes in football a leader isn\u2019t necessary. They\u2019re young; many play for their national teams and are leaders there. They have Champions Leagues. They have to find what a leader gives.\" \n\n**He doesn\u2019t play, but Florentino P\u00e9rez is still there.** \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the leader. He does an incredible job, bringing players you didn\u2019t think would arrive. What he does with the team, with the club\u2026 he\u2019s the best.\" \n\n**Would you return? Imagine they call you\u2026** \n\n\u201cFor what? (laughs). He\u2019s someone I could never say no to. Florentino is special.\u201d \n\n**What was that day in 2009 like when he showed up at your house?** \n\n\u201cI remember the day he came to my house in Lyon. In difficult times, in good times, when I won the Ballon d\u2019Or \u2013 he\u2019s always been great with me. You can\u2019t say no to him.\" \n\n**Tell me about that day in Lyon.** \n\n\u201cFlorentino was already at my house. My agent called saying we had to meet someone. \u2018No, I can\u2019t now, I have things to do.\u2019 He insisted. \u2018Who is it?\u2019 When he told me Florentino P\u00e9rez was there, I didn\u2019t believe it. The man who brought Ronaldo, suddenly in my house? Of course I had to go. From that moment on, all I could think about was Real Madrid, Ronaldo, Zidane\u2026\" \n\n**You reach your house and what was Florentino P\u00e9rez doing?** \n\n\u201cJust being normal, visiting, sitting with my parents. I was in shock but he was relaxed, speaking French with them.\u201d \n\n**Did that day seal your move to Real Madrid?** \n\n\u201cHe told me many things in French. He talked about Real Madrid, I said yes, we shook hands and\u2026\" \n\n**And then a whole life. Good thing your phone was on, right?** \n\n\u201cYes, yes (laughs). That\u2019s how it is \u2013 a whole life. Florentino is the greatest. The level Real Madrid has in every sense is because of him.\u201d \n\n**Because of him and the players he managed to bring, right?** \n\n\u201cHe gave me everything. A lot of confidence. He always spoke to me, to my parents, in good and bad moments.\u201d \n\n**And there were tough moments too.** \n\n\u201cOf course. Over a career there are difficult days when no one helps you, but he was always there.\u201d \n\n**Two weeks ago Al Nassr and Al Ittihad faced each other: Cristiano Ronaldo vs Benzema. The greeting on the pitch looked cold\u2026 you know how journalists are.** \n\n\u201cNo, please. We had already spoken in the locker room. We hugged, talked. On the field we don\u2019t need to do it again. Why repeat it? There\u2019s a lot of respect, we\u2019re fine. We don\u2019t need to show anything. We\u2019ve learned from each other. People act like we need to perform for TV. It\u2019s not like that. There\u2019s respect. On the field, each of us is focused on our job.\u201d \n\n**Few know the truth like you, and you always defend him. But what is Vinicius like?**\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a really good kid with a big heart, eager to learn\u2026 a phenomenon. People put a lot \u2013 a lot \u2013 of pressure on him. Some players shouldn\u2019t have that kind of pressure. He\u2019s still young but already has many games for Real Madrid. You can\u2019t forget what he\u2019s done. You can\u2019t say he\u2019s bad now. It\u2019s not fair. He\u2019s very good, but he can do more. That\u2019s his character. He gets angry when he\u2019s subbed. Normal. OK, he shouldn\u2019t do it, but that\u2019s who he is. He gestures on the pitch and off it. It\u2019s nothing. He feels good on the pitch, thinks he can do things, wants more touches and then gets subbed. That\u2019s why he reacts. It\u2019s normal. It\u2019s nothing.\" \n\n**Do you still see him as a future Ballon d\u2019Or?**\n\n\u201cFor me, he could win it someday. It\u2019s difficult, but he can. The day he locks in that he\u2019s on the pitch only to play and leaves everything else aside, he can win it. He has the quality and he\u2019s in the best place to do it \u2013 Real Madrid. There\u2019s nowhere better.\" \n\n**The last Ballon d\u2019Or was Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, a player who also overcame difficult moments.** \n\n\u201cHe left very tough moments behind. He\u2019s a good person, a phenomenon, a good player. What he\u2019s done in Paris is important. He won the Ballon d\u2019Or because he scored a lot, especially in big, decisive matches. He deserved it.\u201d \n\n**Let\u2019s talk Mbapp\u00e9. Are we seeing the real Mbapp\u00e9 this season?** \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s much better. Scoring isn\u2019t new for him. He did it at PSG and he\u2019ll score at Real Madrid, even more. There will be games where he barely touches the ball. What we expect from Kylian is that when he gets one chance, he scores. Real Madrid is like that. They need him in matches like Atl\u00e9tico, Liverpool\u2026 teams that sit deep. He has to appear, work those situations, link up with Vini. Real Madrid expects Mbapp\u00e9 for those moments, to bring the Champions League. I think he can do it with the other players. Not alone. He needs Vinicius, others\u2026 that\u2019s how it is. \n\n\u201cVinicius, Mbapp\u00e9, Rodrygo even if he doesn\u2019t play much, Bellingham\u2026 they have to communicate. One is there to score, another to assist. We\u2019re not going to ask Bellingham to score because that\u2019s Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s job, and we\u2019re not going to ask Mbapp\u00e9 to be a number 10 because that\u2019s Bellingham. They need to talk. He\u2019s better, but he has to focus more in those moments when Real Madrid needs him because he has everything to do it.\" \n\n**Isn\u2019t it strange how players are now judged by how much they run? Do you understand that?** \n\n\u201cIt depends. Run when you have to run, when something\u2019s missing, because when you score, no one talks about running. Run at the right moment. I\u2019ve scored goals by pressing \u2013 it\u2019s part of the job. I didn\u2019t run a lot, but I did it because I know it\u2019s Madrid. I knew when to do it, especially in Champions League games. It\u2019s not just scoring. The goals I scored against PSG after pressing \u2013 those little things help. I think Mbapp\u00e9 will do it.\" \n\n**You\u2019ve won almost everything here in Saudi Arabia, and everything at Real Madrid. Europe loves you, they idolize you.** \n\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019m very good here. They show me a lot of love \u2013 players, fans, coach, staff. I watch Real Madrid games, I watch the Champions League and I imagine things. The Champions League is magical. My contract is ending, that\u2019s true. I still don\u2019t know if I\u2019m staying or going. It depends on many things. I turn 38 in December. I see myself playing two more years. Physically I\u2019m good, I work hard, and I love football. I enjoy it. We\u2019ll see what happens, what the club thinks. \n\n\u201cI like talking face to face and hearing what they think. The best thing for me is to continue here, but not just to stay for the sake of it for another year or two. That doesn\u2019t work for me. The level of the league is better every year. I\u2019ve been here three years and it keeps rising. It\u2019s true that I have options in Europe. \n\n\"I have to consider everything, choose well, see where I feel good, without forgetting that I feel very good here and receive a lot of affection. But we\u2019ll see. They ask things of me and I give things back. It\u2019s fifty\u2013fifty. But there are options. I\u2019m not going to stop playing and competing in six months.\u201d \n\n**Return to Real Madrid even now?** \n\n\u201cIf Florentino is still there, it\u2019s possible. We talk, and it\u2019s possible. I\u2019m a Madridista. I feel it inside. Madrid is still my city. I feel like a Madridista and a Madrile\u00f1o. We\u2019ll see. If he\u2019s there\u2026\" ",

Has there ever been a pro footballer happy to get subbed off? \n\nHe isn't flailing his arms or cursing or anything; he's just being normal. Like, if any other player did it, it'd be nothing worth talking about. \n\nTuchel as a manager is feeding this journalist well.  \nLook at Xabi's interview after Vini's incident. Tuchel is constantly addressing Jude in every interview in a negative light, whilst no other managers have had bad things to say.
