Can't say he is totally wrong. Sometimes, it feels like this in this sub - which is ruining the fun for others. Been watching Madrid for 20+ years, not sure how we came here. Also, I feel like some rival fans are in this sub and they get into heated discussions (no evidence to back this up, lol).  Anyway, your thoughts?",

        "content": "Whenever people talk about Real Madrid\u2019s forwards, it\u2019s usually Ronaldo, Ra\u00fal, or Benzema who get all the credit. But I feel like Higua\u00edn doesn\u2019t get enough love.\n\nHe scored over 120 goals for Madrid and was super consistent. What stood out to me was how hard he worked off the ball and how well he linked up with teammates, especially Ronaldo and Benzema.\n\nMaybe he wasn\u2019t flashy, or maybe the other stars just overshadowed him.\n\nTo me, he\u2019s the most underrated Madrid player in recent years. Anyone else you feel was unfairly overlooked?",
