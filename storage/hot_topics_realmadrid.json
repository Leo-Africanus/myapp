We\u2019re playing with a back three and honestly I don\u2019t know what the final score will be, but I\u2019m crying tears of joy.\n\nIt\u2019s incredible to see how structured the system is tactically.

But one name that should also stand out with these others is Fran Garcia.\n\nI was personally super disappointed with his performances last season but although it is still too early to judge, I just wanted to take a moment to highlight what a beast Fran Garcia is turning into under Alonso. Provides attacking cover, runs into spaces so Huijsen can find him, links up with midfield, vini and Huijsen in a seamless manner and it seems his overall game play has just been elevated. He is already playing like what we were hoping Carreras would play like. \n\nGame 1: Arguably our best player on the pitch.\n\nGame 2 : Assist \n\nGame 3: Vital interception that led to the first goal\n\nHope he continues this, even if Carreras does come in, a healthy competition for both rising stars would be really good for the team as well as both of their personal development.",

Midfield was fire, and Arda\u2019s vision + composure was unreal. Honestly, best control we\u2019ve shown since Kroos retired. Proper statement win!\n",

Please remember this is the same team that STRUGGLED AGAINST A 9 MAN sevilla side 2 months ago\ud83d\udc80. Yes, it was the end of the season but it was still inexcusable. Therefore I think we're allowed to be a bit hopeful this time",

        "content": "Talent ID is one of the signs of a great manager and Xabi has been bang on so far with Dean Huijsen and Gonzalo Garcia. He has also optimised Arda Guler and Fede Valverde. Arda Guler looks a player with depth centrally and Fede Valaverde is finally doing what he is supposed to do, being a midfielder and not being a road runner. I cant wait to see the other signings Xabi is going to get, Xabi ball in full flow is going to change lives.",
