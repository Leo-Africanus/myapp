        "content": "#FT: CASTILLA 0:1 PONFERRADINA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#1\u00aa FEDERACI\u00d3N\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:** \n\n0:1 Eugene Frimpong 90'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:**\n\n1' - kickoff, vamos! \n\nHT - a heavily disputed match so far in which neither team had a lot of opportunities - only 3 shots by Castilla to two by Ponferradina at half time. The match is marked by hard duels and fouls and was interrupted by two VAR reviews and treatment for Palacios\n\n46' - 2nd half \n\n\ud83d\udd04 65' - Bruno and Manu Serrano on for \u00c1lvaro Gin\u00e9s and Aguado \n\n68' - best chance of the game, early recovery by the team and cross by Pol Fortuny to the far post, where Bruno Iglesias appears, but his header goes pretty far wide for the distance he took it from, almost as if he didn't know where the goal actually is\n\n\ud83d\udd04 77' - Fortea and Arnu on for Jim\u00e9nez and Y\u00e1\u00f1ez\n\n81' - another lengthy revision for an alleged handball by Jim\u00e9nez in the box, but it's not given in the end - this system is such a joke, every challenge is a hail mary effort and they never have clear images anyway, it's beyond belief\n\n\u26bd 90' - and out of nowhere, Ponferradina score with their only chance in the entire game, early recovery, Fortea slips and can't close down Frimpong, who releases quickly from outside the box towards the near post, where Fran can't go down to reach it in time. Julian L\u00f3pez challenges the goal, of course, for no reason, and it will not get overturned anyway \n\nFT - a very frustrating loss after a big fight of a match. Ponferradina score with their only chance - the di St\u00e9fano was their home ground today thanks to Florentino's moronic policies of not letting our fans enter the stadium, and the atmosphere was very heated, which in the end pushed them to scoring the dagger in the last minute. Castilla drop to 8th and are looking likely to miss the playoffs again in their current form... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 12:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid \n\n**Referee**: Sergio Escriche Guzm\u00e1n\n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 1, Matchday 26\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[LaLiga+](https://www.laligaplus.laliga.com/) (subscription - 14.99\u20ac/month) (only available in Spain)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-2-3-1): Fran Gonz\u00e1lez - Diego Aguado (65' Manu Serrano), Mario Rivas, Lamini Fati, David Jim\u00e9nez (77' Jes\u00fas Fortea) - Jorge Cestero, Manuel \u00c1ngel - C\u00e9sar Palacios, Pol Fortuny, Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (77' Adri\u00e1n Arnuncio 'Arnu') - \u00c1lvaro Gin\u00e9s (65' Bruno Iglesias) \n\nBench: Guille S\u00fanico (GK), Cristian David, Dani Mesonero, Gabri Castrelo.\n\nUnavailable: Sergio Mestre (first team call-up), V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as \u2018Valde\u2019 (injury), Joan Mart\u00ednez (injury), Thiago Pitarch (first team call-up), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Rachad Fettal (injury), Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga (red card suspension).\n\nCoach: Juli\u00e1n L\u00f3pez de Lerma\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** LDDWD\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 7th | 37pt | 11-5-9 | 32:33\n",

Everyone\u2019s already comparing him to midfielders like Pedri and Vitinha, which is a lot of hype, but through his highlights you can tell why.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve seen, he looks like the kind of player who can actually control the tempo of a game, something we\u2019ve been missing at times. If he develops properly, he could be a huge piece in our midfield for years.\n\nEven \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa has been hyping him up and talking about his potential to play regularly for the first team, which says a lot.\n\nReally hoping he gets more minutes soon \u2014 I want to see if he can live up to all this hype.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is the hype justified or are the comparisons too early?\n\n",

He is 26 years old and commands the Dortmund defense. The price he is going for is below of what he should be going for. Especially when we got Huijsen for 60 million, and he is the least defensively capable CB we have. Schlotterbeck is the best option for his price tag and will bring the physicality we lack. I hope we don\u2019t miss out on him, since we are known for missing great deals. ",
