        "content": "# \"Xabi Alonso has admitted that Trent Alexander-Arnold is not guaranteed to start for Real Madrid, with Dani Carvajal returning to fitness after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament last season. Alexander-Arnold's arrival from Liverpool was Real's most high-profile piece of business this summer, but he may have to split game time with the Spaniard, who came fourth in the Ballon d'Or last year.\" \n\nThoughts? Have you seen enough from Trent to think he should be first-choice right-back? I know he was a free transfer, but still Trent was a high-profile signing. Personally having watched a lot of Liverpool, Trent can definitely be a defensive liability, especially in 1v1s, but offensively he can make attacking passes that very few other players can. I suspect Alonso will make his choice as the season progresses and based on the opponent's style of play/wingers that would matchup against right-back.   \n",

Now back to the main point of this post, the goals predictions which are just based off of previous seasons (mainly last season of course).\n\nThe CBs and full backs with 3-4 goals, mainly from set pieces and for the full backs from overlaps. Nothing outrageous.\n\nThe midfielders with 6-7 goals pretty realistic in my opinion. Jude will drop because he'll miss about 5 matches or so and will slowly be included in the starting XI by like match 9 or so plus he's not going to be as high up the pitch as he used to be, even like last season. \n\nNow the attackers... Vini with 17 is achievable for him. Mbappe with 29, less than last season which happens usually from stars who join other leagues like Haaland and Kane who had crazy first seasons but, in the 2nd, they scored a bit less. I think it'll be same for Mbappe.\n\nWhat do you think? Agreed? Tell us.",

        "content": "\t\u2022\tHow are you approaching your debut at the Bernab\u00e9u?\n\u201cWe all approach it with anticipation, excitement, and eagerness to start the season. These past two weeks have been short but intense, and we already want to step onto the Bernab\u00e9u. We want to start well. The first match is always important. Tomorrow is the day.\u201d  \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tHow have you seen Mastantuono?\n\u201cThe first time I spoke with him, his personality surprised me a lot. He was only 17 and yet carried himself like a man\u2014very sure of himself. He had no hesitation about taking the step to come to Real Madrid. You can sense that maturity, that drive, that quality. He will integrate very quickly into the team.\u201d  \ufffc \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tWhat level of identity does your team have?\n\u201cWe\u2019re making progress. It\u2019s difficult to measure exactly, and I\u2019m sure we still have a few steps to take. But the main ideas were already introduced during the Club World Cup, and over these past two weeks we\u2019ve worked on them even more. The feeling is positive.\u201d  \ufffc \ufffc \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tIs the squad finalized? Could there be departures?\n\u201cI count on all the players who are here, and I want them all at 100%. We need them. Right now, I count on everyone.\u201d  \ufffc \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tThere\u2019s strong competition at right back\u2014do you know who will start?\n\u201cI\u2019m clear that that is excellent competition. I love that in every position we have two capable players. Sometimes I\u2019ll have to make selections, but we have depth in every position. Carva (Carvajal) is getting closer to his top level, which is great for the team. We have many matches ahead.\u201d  \ufffc \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tHow do you feel about the match not being postponed?\n\u201cNow the schedule is unchangeable, but our request\u2014mainly for the players\u2019 health\u2014would have been nice to have supported. It couldn\u2019t be done. We\u2019ve only had two weeks, and there are no excuses. The team can compete tomorrow. Heart and desire push more than the legs.\u201d  \ufffc \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tThe Miami match\u2014does it distort the competition?\n\u201cI fully agree with the club\u2019s statement. If rules are changed, it must be by unanimous agreement of all participants. Right now, that\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d  \ufffc \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tWhat do you think of the phenomenon Lamine Yamal?\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a pressure meter\u2026 He is becoming a key player for both Bar\u00e7a and the national team. The time to face him will come.\u201d  \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tHow have Vinicius and Mbapp\u00e9 taken on the message?\n\u201cIt\u2019s about all lines being aware. For forwards, it\u2019s important that when we transition defensively they don\u2019t get left behind\u2014and also that when we attack, the defense pushes forward. We want to function as a team. That will help us maintain better structure defensively and offensively. We took a step forward during the Club World Cup, and it\u2019s something we\u2019ve been working on.\u201d  \ufffc \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tWhat promise can you make to the fans?\n\u201cI\u2019m more of a doer than a speaker. Promising before doing doesn\u2019t usually work in football. We also have a lot of desire and energy to bring to the stadium\u2014and deserve it. Saying it doesn\u2019t make it so. We want to begin that journey tomorrow.\u201d  \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tHow do you choose the \u2018defensive boss\u2019?\n\u201cThat has to come naturally. It has to emerge organically from the players. We have communicative players who are asserting themselves quickly. Leadership should emerge from what you project, not impose. There may be more than one leader.\u201d  \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tRefs?\n\u201cWe begin the season, and we\u2019ll see how things go. Hopefully, we won\u2019t have to talk about referees.\u201d  \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tHow is Rodrygo? What role do you envision for him?\n\u201cThere are many rumors in summer. I\u2019ve seen he\u2019s in good shape. I count on everyone, and I want them to feel for and belong to the team\u2014and be at 100%. That\u2019s what concerns me and occupies me now.\u201d  \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tMallorca\u2013Bar\u00e7a controversy?\n\u201cIt\u2019s not up to me to comment on what happens in other matches, but I listened to what Arrasate said, and he explained it very well.\u201d  \ufffc \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tWhat can Mastantuono bring?\n\u201cHe could have minutes tomorrow. He will provide quality, energy, is defensively committed, has good drive. I\u2019ve seen in him that Argentine fighting spirit. He\u2019s good with the final pass. He\u2019s at a very good level.\u201d  \ufffc \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tBrahim\u2014how surprised are you by him?\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen him in good form. I already knew how he thinks about his position. He excels in tight spaces. He didn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d  \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tMastantuono said Messi is the best in the world\u2026\n\u201cI can see it makes sense that his favorite player is Messi. Being Argentine, that\u2019s not a surprise to me.\u201d  \ufffc \ufffc\n\t\u2022\t11 years since your last match as a player for Madrid?\n\u201cI have very good memories. I returned with Bayern and felt the love. Now my role is different, but I\u2019m expectant and motivated\u2014eager to feel that connection with the fans again. Let whatever happens, happen\u2014and let them feel whatever they want to feel. I\u2019m happy to be back.\u201d  ",

From what I\u2019ve gathered, he made Madrid competitive again, especially against Barcelona, and his time is still remembered as one of the most intense and successful periods in recent history.",

I think he thinks to play Mastantuono rather than Guler, so it looks like they will competete to get jersey on the pitch. Who will play ahead of whom do you think?",

        "content": "The highly anticipated debut of Franco Mastantuono with Real Madrid could bring more complications than celebrations. Between excitement and controversy, the young Argentine finds himself at the center of a legal debate that could trouble Xabi Alonso\u2019s team.\n\nDespite being presented as a first-team player, Mastantuono has been officially registered with Real Madrid Castilla to keep a senior squad number (1-25) available for the transfer market. This maneuver raised eyebrows: if he plays, could Madrid face allegations of fielding an ineligible player?\n\nThe strongest criticism came from Miguel Gal\u00e1n, president of CENAFE, who accused Madrid of acting in \u201cbad faith\u201d with the registration. Gal\u00e1n argued that presenting Mastantuono as a first-team signing while registering him with the B team amounts to fraud, a move that violates Article 125 of the RFEF\u2019s General Regulations.\n\nHe explained that an ineligible lineup only applies if the player actually takes the field, not simply being called up. Still, the bigger issue lies in the precedent: allowing top signings to be registered with reserve squads could distort competition in divisions like Castilla\u2019s, creating an unfair advantage\n",

Do I need to use a VPN ? On which website are you able to see the matches ? (I don't have TV, only internet)\n\nThanks and best regards",
