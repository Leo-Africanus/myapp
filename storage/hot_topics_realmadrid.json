        "content": "As a Real Madrid fan since the 2000s, I see that Barcelona plays better, and with better tactics than Madrid. If you look at the record, the last time they scored 5 goals against Bar\u00e7a was almost 20 years ago, while it seems like they only score 5 in a match every two years. In Mourinho's era, even though we had a good tactic, it still seemed like we struggled, but we put up a fight. And every defeat Madrid suffered against Bar\u00e7a (except for the 5-0) didn't feel like a humiliation; it felt like the team had given everything, but we just couldn't pull it off. Even with Zidane, things didn't change. At La Masia, I'm sure they teach them to hate Madrid, which is why they always have a better chance of winning. It's a shame that Madrid, or at least their academy, doesn't do something similar. Maybe then we'd stop being humiliated so often. Although, the best thing would be winning the Champions League, it seems like for them, a Cl\u00e1sico is more important than the Champions League.",

Then we got Endrick, signed two years(2022 to 2024) before he actually started. Two years waiting for this young talent to arrive, while relying on false #9s! I watched Palmeiras games to track his progress. In that time he made a debut for the Brazilian NT and also got handed the NT #9 shirt! \n\n  \nRough but a decent start with good goals for Madrid. I was super excited looking forward to his second season. He was even handed our #9 shirt. \n\n  \nNow where is he? Lyon.\n\nWho do we have in his place? Masty and GG. Both decent players but what's their RMA story, compared to Endrick?\n\n  \nSame with Odegaard - tracked him through many loan spells, watched him grow wonderfully, only for him to land in Arsenal. In his place? Arda, who is a brilliant player but a last-minute signing. Can't compare both players' histories on Madrid's books before their debuts.\n\nWon't be surprised if Nico Paz follows a similar arch.\n\n\nCurrent crop of players just give me meh vibes. Mishmash RMA history. Only recently started to seriously admit academy players, too. \n\n  \nI'm a case study of one obviously. But, so much fan loyalty is being flushed down the drain by this club.\n\n  \nHoping for a better turnout in 2026.",

So no better time than implement them now.\n\nIdeally I would want Xabi to start every player he would want to start to implement a high press if Kylian was available and just replace Kylian with Garcia(or Rodrygo if\\* he is not the preferred RW). By this way, if we are playing better, he has a better chance of convincing Kylian to press and doesnt have to change tactics later.",

        "title": "Is Summer 2026 the time for a complete squad overhaul?",
        "content": "Happy New Year everyone!\n\nIt's no secret that our current squad has had some obvious gaps and problems for a while. Some players are aging, others are too injury prone, others are too young and not ready to help the team on a consistent basis and others have been simply underperforming for a while now.\n\nRecently I was looking atother UCL winning squads of recent years to see how much they have transformed since winning the trophy:\n\n1. Two years after Manchester City won the treble in 2023, all of these players have left the club: Ederson, Walker, Laporte, Akanji, Cancelo, Gundogan, De Bruyne, Grealish, Mahrez and Alvarez. That's of course without including players that barely played like Palmer, Phillips, Carson etc. From the 13 players that played in the 2023 final, only 7 are still there, with Stones (out of contract), Bernardo (out of contract) and Ake also being likely to leave at the end of this season.\n2. Chelsea won the UCL in 2021 and by the end of summer 2023 all of these players were gone: Mendy, Azpilicueta, Rudiger, Christensen, Zouma, Alonso, Kovacic, Kante, Jorginho, Ziyech, Mount, Pulisic, Havertz, Werner, Giroud, Abraham etc. Again, excluding players with very minimal minutes. From the 14 players who participated in the 2021 final, the only ones who were still there in September 2023: James (still a starter), Chilwell (barely played since 2023, left on loan and then permanently) and Thiago Silva (left in 2024).\n3. Bayern 2020 were a bit more \"stubborn\" compared to the other two. By 2022, Javi Martinez, Alaba, Boateng, Sule, Thiago, Tolisso and Lewandowski had left the club. Out of the 15 players that participated in the 2020 final, 7 were still there in September 2022, but a couple of them were loanees (Coutinho, Perisic).\n\nComparing these to our own 2024 winning squad:\n\nWe're entering the 4th transfer window since that final and the only (important) players who have left are Nacho, Vazquez, Kroos (retired), Modric and Joselu (technically didn't leave as a loanee, so I'll include him). The ironic thing is that 4/5 could have been really useful for our current squad.\n\nIt's worth noting that we've made a combined... 1.5 million from these 5 players leaving. Manchester City in 2023-25 made around 280 million Euros on sales. Chelsea made around 200 million in the next two years, while they made 282m on sales in 23/24 season alone! Bayern made far less in the first two seasons (around 25m), but it was also the COVID period. In 22/23 they made more than 120m and the season after, more than 170m.\n\nWith this little \"research\" you can see that we've been pretty inactive in the market, both when it comes to buying, but also selling.\n\nWhile other teams sell and buy many players every window, we have too many players sitting on their contracts and just waiting for them to end, while we also wait for world class from other clubs to be out of contract, so maybe we can sign them. Right now we have a whole... back 5 of players who are past their respective primes and they're constantly injured and can barely offer anything to this team consistently (Carvajal, Militao, Rudiger, Alaba, Mendy). It's no disrespect to try to sell them somewhere. Mendy has a contract until 2028, is our 3rd choice LB and has played 1 game this season. Alaba has started 2 games and in one of them he was subbed off injured. Alaba and Rudiger are out of contract this summer, let's see what happens to the other 3.\n\nWe should also start consider selling some players on their \"prime\" years. Ever since Mbappe joined, the big question was what's gonna happen to Rodrygo and Vini. 1 year later, Rodrygo lost his place in the line-up, had the worst goal drought ever by a RM attacker and now his market value has been HALVED. Pretty much ALL of our players are losing value compared to previous seasons.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not saying that we should sell our whole team for no reason, nor that we can compete financially with an oil club like Man City or Chelsea's... 40-man squad. But our current transfer strategy is simply not sustainable, we can't keep holding a whole squad, because they've been succesful IN THE PAST. Or relying on getting free agents and waiting for 18 year olds to turn world class. Imo we should start buying AND selling a lot more than what we've been doing recently.",

Camavinga and Valverde can get back to midfield. Sounds sorted on paper. I don\u2019t trust Gonzalo Garcia in the box more than Bellingham. And Vini and Jude have great chemistry together.

        "content": "I'm a Bar\u00e7a fan, but respect RM as long as their fans respect FCB, and only disrespect RM if I see disrespect to FCB. My hot take is that if Real Madrid had a better manager during the three-peat period, they would've won at least 2 trebles out of 3. That team was way to good not to have won a treble, and I think it's because Zizou's team lacked tactical identity, it was just talent, which is why they couldn't win the treble. Take Pep's Barca of 2009 or Enrique's Barca of 2015 as an example. They had talent and identity which was key to their success. I am not downplaying the three-peat, I'm just saying if a manager like Mourinho or Pep was in charge of that team, they'd have a clear style of play and could've done a thee-peat of trebles. No hate, just a hot take, and I'm interested to see the perspective of a Real Madrid fan on this.",
