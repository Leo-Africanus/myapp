        "content": "#FT: CASTILLA 2:1 BARAKALDO \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#1\u00aa FEDERACI\u00d3N\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:** \n\n1:0 C\u00e9sar Palacios 44'\n\n1:1 Sabin Merino 51'\n\n2:1 David Jim\u00e9nez 73'\n\nRed card: Dani Mesonero (Castilla) 88'\n\nRed card: \u00c1lvaro Leiva (Castilla) 90'+8 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - kickoff, vamos! \n\n\u26bd 44' - GOLLLL DEL CASTILLA - Pitarch drives the ball forward and plays it to \u00c1lvaro Gin\u00e9s at the edge of the box, he redirects it with one touch perfectly into the box to Palacios, who finishes calmly into the bottom corner for a lead just before half time! \n\nHT - a first half that was relatively quiet on both ends and saw Castilla struggling increasingly as the match went on, ends in the best possible way for Castilla, finishing off their best attack with a goal just before half time\n\n46' - 2nd half underway \n\n\u26bd 51' - goal for Barakaldo after an error chain in Castilla's defense - first their winger can easily free himself from getting double teamed by David and Y\u00e1\u00f1ez, with especially David getting beaten way too easily - then Joan majorly mistimes his tackle and leaves the space for Merino, who enters the box and finishes near post for the equaliser. The goal gets checked, but stands \n\n60' - Castilla is letting the match slip away now, huge save by Fran on a header after a free kick\n\n\ud83d\udd04 62' - Leiva and Mesonero on for Y\u00e1\u00f1ez and Cristian David\n\n\u26bd 73' - GOLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - Spectacular play by Pitarch, who receives the ball, dribbles forward and plays a spectacular ball through the entire Barakaldo defense, finding David Jim\u00e9nez - he has time and stays calm, finishing easily past the keeper for another lead\n\n\ud83d\udd04 79' - Pol Fortuny comes on for \u00c1lvaro Gin\u00e9s\n\n\ud83d\udfe5 88' - straight red card for Mesonero, who arrives high and hits his opponent in the foot\n\n90' - the scene gets reviewed, and although he clearly hits him on the side of his ankle, the referee, like a true cheeky bastard, points high at his own calf and sends him off anyway - truly corrupt refereeing at every level\n\n\ud83d\udd04 90'+2 - Lamini comes on for Palacios to salvage the 3 points\n\n90'+7 - huge chance for the equaliser as a header floats over Fran and hits the post, then Joan clears it off the line\n\n\ud83d\udfe5 90'+8 - another red card for Castilla... Leiva pushes his opponent to the ground off the ball and with the game stopped... Incredibly stupid, but very harsh again... But Castilla has run out of challenges, so Arbeloa can't ask for one\n\n90'+9 - another spectacular save by Fran Gonz\u00e1lez, who denies a great bycicle kick that was headed straight at the top corner\n\n90'+10 - a penalty is getting reviewed in Castilla's box... \n\n90'+11 - the penalty is not given in the end, offside is given instead\n\n90'+12 - one final huge chance for Barakaldo, but their player puts it just wide from a tight angle\n\nFT - what a dramatic end to this match that was relatively calm and unspectactular for the most part - Castilla manage to salvage the win despite playing the added time with 9 men, with a great Fran between the posts and efficiency in front of the opposition's goal. Leiva and Mesonero get shown Castilla's 6th and 7th red cards of the season, and although both decisions were harsh, they were still two stupid and risky actions, that Arbeloa's players seemingly can't refrain from\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 14:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee**: Ignacio de Santisteban Adame\n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 1, Matchday 14\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[LaLiga+](https://www.laligaplus.laliga.com/) (subscription - 14.99\u20ac/month) (only available in Spain)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-3-3): Fran Gonz\u00e1lez - Manu Serrano, V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as, Joan Mart\u00ednez, David Jim\u00e9nez - Jorge Cestero, Thiago Pitarch, Cristian David (62' Dani Mesonero) - C\u00e9sar Palacios (90'+2 Lamini Fati), \u00c1lvaro Gin\u00e9s (79' Pol Fortuny), Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (62' \u00c1lvaro Leiva) \n\nBench: Guille S\u00fanico (GK), Jes\u00fas Fortea, Mario Rivas, Gabri Castrelo, Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga. \n\nUnavailable: Diego Aguado (?), Manuel \u00c1ngel (red card suspension), Roberto Mart\u00edn (injury), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Bruno Iglesias (injury), Rachad Fettal (injury). \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** DWLWL\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 4th | 21pt | 7-0-6 | 15:16\n",

Here are my thoughts on some teams\n\n4th and 5th teams in UCL (anyone who isn't Real, Barca or Atletico)\n- this season Bilbao sits at 26th, Villarreal at 34th\n- last season we had Girona at 33th\n- obviously we had Villarreal surprising us in 21/22, but overall there were 3 teams from La Liga in UCL quarterfinals in the last 15 years (also Sevilla in 17/18 and Malaga in 12/13, both losing)\n- Sevilla and Villarreal got hit hard by La Liga FFP rules\n\nAtletico\n- since 15/16 final and 16/17 semis they never made it through quarterfinals\n- didn't get near the league title since 20/21\n- seem stuck despite spending big last season\n- still beat us heavily this season\n\nBarcelona\n- since Messi left they've played with Adama Traore and Braithwaithe\n- then they got some 35 year olds and a bunch of kids from academia\n- won just as many league, cup and supercup titles as us\n- easy draw helped them in UCL last year, but they're still ranked as 9th in Europe\n\nFinally Real Madrid\n- the most valuable squad in the world\n- going toe to toe with the worst Barcelona in years\n- squad getting gradually messier (heh) ever since Ronaldo left\n- miracle UCL titles in 21/22 and 23/24 make it seem like we're in control \n\nEPL currently has the best PR, insane ticket prices and a bunch of clubs that might get it right every season. Then there's PSG and Bayern and obviously some upsets every year\n\nAs Barca, or more drastically United have proved major clubs don't go bankrupt, but I fear that if nothing changes soon we'll be fighting for those \"upset spots\".

        "content": "So with all the rumours about Real Madrid looking at free-agent centre-backs, I\u2019ve been trying to make sense of the situation. The three main names linked were Konat\u00e9, Guehi, and Upamecano. And honestly, after watching them and looking at their profiles, I feel like we have to be careful with our choices here.\n\nKonat\u00e9 was initially the most hyped option, but now multiple reports say Madrid aren\u2019t going to pursue him. And honestly, I get it. Injuries and inconsistency  make it a risky investment.\n\nMarc Guehi is a player I genuinely like. He\u2019s calm, strong, good on the ball. But let\u2019s be real \u2014 Madrid are suffering badly in aerial duels lately, especially defending crosses and long balls. Guehi is not elite aerially, and if we\u2019re rebuilding the defensive line, we can\u2019t afford to bring someone who doesn\u2019t fix one of our biggest weaknesses. And let\u2019s not pretend he\u2019ll be cheap. High wages + average aerial presence = a questionable fit.\n\nUpamecano is another player I love on his day. Good ball carrier, very aggressive, insanely athletic. But again, he\u2019s mostly an RCB. We already have a world-class RCB in \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o. There is no point stacking two elite RCBs while leaving the LCB role incomplete. If Madrid are building for trophies now, the priority should be signing a world-class left-footed LCB. Upamecano is great, but he doesn\u2019t solve the positional puzzle.\n\nDean Huijsen is a generational talent in my eyes. But he\u2019s 20. He shouldn\u2019t be carrying the defence yet, and he shouldn\u2019t have pressure dumped on him. Let him grow, let him play as a rotational option behind two elite CBs. We\u2019ve already seen him get shaky in big matches \u2014 which is normal for a kid. Throwing him in as a starter is how you ruin a career. He should be learning from the best, not replacing them.\n\n\n---\n\nAnd this brings me to the one player that ticks every single box:\nNico Schlotterbeck.\n\n\n\u2022 Left-footed CB (a rare profile)\n\u2022 Elite in the air (71%+ aerial win rate, high 90th percentile)\n\u2022 Elite ball progression (progressive passes + carries both 90th+ percentile)\n\u2022 Strong defender (top-tier interceptions, clearances, duels)\n\u2022 Age 25 \u2014 perfect mix of experience + long-term value\n\u2022 Plays for a big club already, used to pressure\n\u2022 Available \u2014 either for a reasonable fee now or free next year\n\u2022 Top clubs already circling \u2014 Barca, Liverpool, others\n\nJust watching his play style and seeing Bastoni comparisons makes sense. And honestly, in many defensive metrics, Schlotterbeck is better. Bastoni isn\u2019t leaving Inter, and even if he did, the price would be insane. Saliba renewed. Gvardiol impossible. The list of elite, attainable LCBs is shockingly small \u2014 and Schlotterbeck is one of the very few who checks every box.\n\nWhat I love most is how complete he is. He\u2019s not just a \u201cball-playing\u201d defender. He\u2019s not just \u201cgood in the air.\u201d He\u2019s one of the most well-rounded CBs in Europe, and the data backs it. Whether it\u2019s aerial duels, clearances, progressive passes, defensive duels, interceptions \u2014 he\u2019s near the top in almost everything. Add his physical profile, confidence, and left foot, and he becomes the exact partner Milit\u00e3o needs.\n\nAnd unlike other targets, he\u2019s attainable right now. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t want Madrid to \u201cwait for a free transfer.\u201d Because the longer we wait, the more clubs will scrap for him. Barca already want him. Liverpool already want him. If we sit still, we\u2019ll lose him.\n\nIn short a back 4 of \n\nCarrerras schlotterbeck militao trent\n\nIs nothing short of world class.",

        "title": "CHEMA - OUR FUTURE MIDFIELD MAESTRO",
        "content": "Such a rare profile that we needs so badly.\nHe is a fucking prospect who is going to be a superstar MIDFIELDER for many years .\n\n\nChema Andr\u00e9s is rapidly emerging as one of Europe\u2019s most exciting young midfield prospects, and the combination of his physical qualities, tactical intelligence, and elite defensive output suggests he could develop into a superstar within the next few years. What makes him stand out at just 20 years old is how complete and mature his playing profile already looks.\n\nFirst, Chema\u2019s defensive metrics are elite even when compared to top-five-league midfielders. He ranks 1st in aerial duels, 1st in aerial duels won, 1st in interceptions, and 1st in possession-adjusted interceptions, which is almost unheard of for a player so young. His ability to win the ball both on the ground and in the air gives him a rare \u201cball-winning dynamo\u201d profile. In modern football, where controlling transitions is everything, this alone makes him extremely valuable.\n\nBut what elevates him beyond being just a destroyer is his quality on the ball. He ranks 1st in pass completion into the penalty area, showing composure and vision under pressure. While he\u2019s not a pure dribbler or ball carrier yet, his forward passing, progressive passing, and ability to retain possession show a player who reads the game like a seasoned deep-lying midfielder. Scouts describe him as a \u201ctouch magnet\u201d \u2014 a player who wants the ball in tight spaces and makes the game flow.\n\nChema also covers huge amounts of space defensively. His heat maps and radar charts show a player who reads danger early, steps into passing lanes, and filters opposition attacks before they develop. This combination of positional discipline, anticipation, and physical dominance is exactly what defines top-level modern No. 6s like Rodri, Casemiro, and Declan Rice. Analysts calling him a \u201cbaby Rodri\u201d isn't hype \u2014 the profile really is that similar.\n\nMost importantly, Chema's ceiling is enormous because he\u2019s already performing at elite levels with very few senior minutes. Young midfielders usually struggle with positioning, timing, and decision-making, but Chema already looks like a finished product defensively. With more experience, improved ball-carrying, and tactical refinement, he has every tool to become a world-class anchor midfielder.\n\nIf he continues on his current trajectory \u2014 and especially if he returns to a possession-dominant team like Real Madrid \u2014 Chema Andr\u00e9s could become one of Europe\u2019s most dominant midfielders within a couple of years.",

        "content": "**On AC Milan**\n\n\"I always said that after Real Madrid everything is a step down, everyone can confirm that. But I think I've joined a club that is very close to Real Madrid in terms of reputation and history. It was an ideal situation for me.\n\nWhen the Milan option appeared, I knew that was it. I stayed at a high level. The Italian league is one of the most competitive in Europe, it is not easy to play. But ot was an easy choice for me. Especially because of the approach of the people and the club.\"\n\n**On his departure from Real Madrid**\n\n\"Leaving Real Madrid wasn't easy, I spent half my life there. That was one of the best periods of my life. I arrived quite late, at 27, but I was ready for that leap. Four years in England helped me a lot. Everything after that seems unreal to me, what I achieved.\n\nIf someone had said to me: \"Write what you would be happy with at Real Madrid\", I would have been afraid to write everything I achieved later. Trophies and victories are aside, but staying at a club like that for 13 years... From 27 to almost 40, that's something incredible.\n\nWe know what Madrid is like, a club that doesn't tolerate mediocrity. Staying at a club like that for so many years is the most incredible thing. When I arrived, I thought it would be great if I stayed for five or six years. I thought careers lasted until 33\u201334. Not only have I surpassed that, I'm still at that level.\"\n\n\"Staying at Real Madrid was really my big wish, it wasn't just platitudes or flattery to the fans. Sometimes some wishes don't come true. Even though my wish to retire in Madrid didn't come true, I achieved some things I never thought I would. I don't regret anything. I never expected this in my wildest dreams.\n\n\"The love of the fans, the club and all the people connected to the club remains forever. I have no words to thank them for that treatment. It was like that from day one. Even though I had difficulties at the beginning, I felt the love and affection of the fans. They felt that I was the one. That gave me the motivation to give back to them in the best way.\"",

So, hopefully with the wave of comments from the players and Xabi after yesterday's match about sticking together and focusing on helping each other, this would bring the team back on track and we resume the upwards momentum we've built up to our match against Barcelona.\n\nThere are things to fix, but as long as the board is supportive of Xabi and the players are fully bought into this new era, we're going to be a very competitive team and we've seen it earlier in the season, we just need that aggression back and we should be good!
