        "content": "This isn't \"rage-after-a-draw\" talk or some reactionary street language. This is literally what Spanish journalists have been saying nonstop over the past hours. What's happening at Real Madrid is a full-on administrative disaster. Yes the chaos on the pitch and the disgusting behavior in midfield is 100% the board's fault. No debate.\n\nXabi Alonso is a very good coach, at least against small and medium teams. He started the season destroying them without mercy, which is exactly how you win a league comfortably. He showed personality, he didn\u2019t care if he benched Bellingham or Vinicius , everyone saw it in the Club World Cup and the early weeks of the season.\n\nThen suddenly everything flipped the moment some of the \"holy cows\" in the locker room started acting up.\nYep  the board stepped in and basically told Xabi not to be too harsh on certain players. Or in other words: \"Find a middle ground between you and the players.\"\nThat might work in some random street caf\u00e9 not in a football club.\n\nThis isn't even a defense of Xabi. He made mistakes, sure. But let's ask the million-dollar question:\n\n**Does the coach have complete freedom**?\nOf course not. Not even close. It's impossible for him to make any decision freely because if one of the \"holy cows\" drops in form, their market value drops with them  and the board can't have that.\n\nThese deadweight names aren't going to succeed. These lost players won't give you anything. They failed under the smiling  coach, and they failed under the strict and demanding one. They're rotting pieces that will drag down the whole club unless the board steps in.\n",

He was the top scorer in the Copa del Rey and produced some really nice goals.\n\nI agree that his overall game still needs improvement, but he brings that goal threat which most of our attackers except Mbapp\u00e9 (and to some extent Gonzalo Garc\u00eda) are lacking right now.\n\nYoung talent do not want to come to Madrid if they risk rotting on the bench for no reason.   \n",

        "title": "2024/25. A detailed breakdown of everything that's wrong with us this season",
        "content": "This might be a bit of a rant, but I\u2019m genuinely tired of seeing half-baked analysis with zero depth. I\u2019ll try to give a sensible, short overview of the issues we\u2019re seeing this season. This won\u2019t be an in-depth tactical breakdown (not my expertise). It\u2019s just basic things I consider logical, and I think most people should agree with me on.\n\nI\u2019ll be trying to touch on the following points, in no particular order:\n\n\\- Is Mbappe a problem? Can we win the big trophies with him? Does he have to prove himself?  \n\\- Is Vinicius a problem? Is he finished because he didn\u2019t win the Ballon d\u2019Or?  \n\\- Arda Guler or Jude Bellingham at number 10? How do we resolve this issue?  \n\\- How well is Xabi doing? Is he being thrown under the bus?  \n\\- Rodrygo? Garcia?  \n\\- Fan FC battles: Jude FC &amp; Vini FC vs Mbappe FC &amp; Guler FC.  \n\\- Ancelotti\u2019s sacking and what we can learn from it.\n\nIt's a lot to go through so please bear with me. **First**, let\u2019s start with last season. We signed Mbappe and had a terrible season, going trophyless even though he scored a lot of goals. This resulted in Carlo\u2019s sacking. Meanwhile, PSG went on to win the Champions League and looked better as a team doing it.\n\nNaturally, questions have not started being asked and the fanbase has became divided. Some acknowledge that Mbappe is a world class player but still think that questions should be asked of his play and ability to deliver high-end trophies. Alternatively, we have two other more extreme positions; those who think Mbappe is the second coming of Ronaldo, and those who think he should never have been signed because he's \u201cthe problem.\u201d\n\nWhat do I think? **I think Mbappe is a generational player and I've always been a fan(to reasonable extents)**. However, I've also always said that Mbappe had to prove himself at Real Madrid. I think this is a reasonable stance to take. He\u2019s always demanded that any team he plays in be built around him. **However, he's not proven to be clutch enough to make that sacrifice worth it**. If the main reasons for his failures to win the UCL or Ballon d'or have always been his teammates, it doesn't make sense to walk into a team that(at the time of his arrival) had won 2/3 UCL trophies and still insist that those(new) team-mates are the reason why those failures continue. He's running out of excuses.\n\nHe joined Real Madrid because we can help him get to the next level. But we can\u2019t do that if we make the mistakes PSG did. Unfortunately, Mbappe\u2019s signing seems to have come with a lot of unreasonable fans that seem to think it\u2019s worthwhile to sacrifice every other player (who\u2019ve proven themselves in the shirt) to please him. This is foolish IMO. They try to compare him to Ronaldo. The difference is that Ronaldo came into Real Madrid more accomplished than other players. Even then, he had to earn the right to be crowned their king by proving himself not only with goals, but with CRUCIAL goals that WON US TROPHIES. Until Mbappe does that, we absolutely should not treat him as untouchable no matter how many goals he scores, or how good he is for France. **This is why we\u2019re Real Madrid.**\n\nOn the other hand, I see a lot of extreme opinions saying our chances in the future are worse with him. I STRONGLY disagree, and will give my reasons why I don\u2019t think this is the right stance either. IMO, these opinions are wrong because they\u2019re born out of frustration rather than logic. Seeing a large number of irrational Mbappe fans throw our other players under the bus has given an excuse for these people to do the same to him, which is why we\u2019ve seen a rise of in-fighting between these \u201ccults.\u201d Neither side is accurate IMO.\n\nAlthough, at least for the Vini and Jude cults, it\u2019s a good thing that most of them are actually Real Madrid fans since both of these players didn\u2019t really bring a large fanbase over. It\u2019s not Mbappe\u2019s fault that he has a following that cares more about him than the club, especially a following that\u2019s so insecure that they don\u2019t want anyone to share the spotlight with him. However, most of his fans are absolutely ridiculous. I don\u2019t intend to go on a rant about them. I\u2019d rather try to ignore them as much as I can. They degrade the conversation.\n\nNow to give my answer to the questions I\u2019ve raised so far, here's what I think:\n\n**I think Real Madrid should be dominating European football with Mbappe, Vinicius, and Bellingham, and that removing any of these three reduces our chances of success. I also think that hypothetically, Mbappe and Vinicius would be our best players about 50% and 30% of the time each.**\n\nHere\u2019s why I think so. Once again, I don\u2019t claim to be a tactico, but here are some stats from last season:  \n\\- Mbappe: 45G + 5A = 50  \n\\- Vinicius: 22G + 19A = 41  \n\\- Jude: 15G + 15A = 30\n\n&gt;! Please note that I'm not making my conclusions based on these stats alone! as that would be shallow. I'm talking based on everything I've watched of these players, both in and out of a Real Madrid shirt, as well as recent clips I watched of our highlights in the last two seasons. !&lt;\n\nTo continue, in my opinion, this looks good and is what we actually want to see! And yet the consensus in the fanbase today seems to be that this trio will never work and we need to pick only one or a combination of two of these players. They use last season and a few games this season as their evidence.\n\nBut I disagree. Yes, last season was bad, but it was definitely not because of anything that shows these three fundamentally don't work as a group. **We had much bigger problems:**\n\n\\- Fran Garcia and Vasquez playing at fullback. Nothing much to say about this. We lost both Carvajal and Mendy to injury, of course.\n\n\\- Having to mostly play Asencio (inexperienced) and Tchouameni at CB, with Rudiger being out of form and playing with injury in most cases.\n\n\\- Losing Kroos (very crucial due to his passing ability), Modric having his minutes managed even more, and losing Tchouameni in midfield because he played as a CB so many times. Joselu as well (though his presence was less felt).\n\n\\- We also had Jude playing with an injury mostly, which is noteworthy.\n\n\\- Mbappe being out of form at a crucial time in the beginning of the season, so we had to play catch-up in the league after. This is very understandable because he was new, and yet he adapted well enough to still end up as our best player.\n\n\\- Understandably, it also took some time for Vinicius and Mbappe to form any kind of connection.\n\n\\- Ancelotti insisting on moving from a front 2 to a front 3 with Rodrygo, giving us even fewer bodies in midfield. This was a consistently bizarre choice Ancelotti kept making. On one hand, it\u2019s difficult to defend this. On the other, it could have been because we had so few options in midfield that he saw Rodrygo as a better pick rather than having to pick 4 midfielders out of Jude.\n\n**When you consider all of this**, the truth is that we had major problems. We had too many injuries in defence and were too light in midfield. **And yet today I see a lot of revisionism**:\n\n\\- Being dishonest about Ancelotti to make Xabi seem better than he actually is. My answer to this is that while Carlo had to be held accountable for last season and the board wanted a change, judging him as a manager off last season is ridiculous. He wasn\u2019t adequately backed and lost key players to retirement and injuries. Also, sometimes bad seasons happen. To the hardcore Xabi defenders: if we held him to the same standards for last season alone, he went trophyless last season and had some embarrassing cup defeats.\n\n\\- Pushing the claim that Vinicius is \u201cfinished\u201d because he didn\u2019t win the Ballon d\u2019Or, or because he \u201chasn\u2019t scored in the last 10 games.\u201d This is another silly claim. They pretend like he didn\u2019t have 41 G+A last season and doesn\u2019t have 12 so far in this one, and try to use last season to single him out.\n\n\\-I\u2019ve also seen ridiculous takes about Bellingham and Fede (who\u2019s out of form atm but is still a good player).\n\n**This season**, we've addresses many of these issues, **while others have fixed themselves:**\n\n\\- Militao and Rudiger coming back fully fit. Carvajal coming back as well alongside Mendy.  \n\\- Signed Huijsen and Carreras. Signed Trent. That\u2019s 3 defensive additions.  \n\\- Called up Garcia, who\u2019s shown that he can be a good backup and offer us a different dynamic in CF when needed, just like Joselu.\n\nOur team already starts to look good at this point. So keeping in mind that we made these signings(and that we had players coming from injury), **here's what I think our plans for this season should have been:**\n\n\\- Invest in and improve the offensive dynamic between Vini &amp; Mbappe (with Jude) so they\u2019re more consistent and dangerous to play against. As I showed, last season was promising. This season should be even better.\n\n\\- Sign a replacement for Kroos. It doesn\u2019t have to be exactly like him, just a midfielder that sticks exclusively to midfield duties, particularly one that\u2019s very good in possession. Once again, I\u2019m not a tactico, so though I have some ideas, I\u2019m not confident enough to state them.\n\n\\- Rotate effectively to get Rodrygo back in form and keep Goncalo Garcia active. They\u2019d be crucial in a long season.\n\n\\- Keep Modric. He\u2019s still quality and leaves us a leader in the dressing room and an extra person to call on if we\u2019re in trouble.\n\n\\- Stick to the same 4-4-2 which has been used in almost every successful season we\u2019ve enjoyed recently.\n\n\\- Perhaps get Mbappe and Vini(Mbappe especially) to do a bit more work out of possession?\n\n\\- Create a culture where players are comfortable with being rotated, while still making them feel valued. We showed glimpses of this in the CWC.\n\nAnd so our expected formation would be a 4-4-2 with:  \nVini.                         Mbappe  \nJude  \nNM                             Tchouameni              Valverde\n\nCarreras. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Militao.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Rudiger.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Carvajal\n\nnote: NM means \u201cnew midfielder\u201d, the one that would good in possession.\n\nArguments can be made in some cases: Trent/Carvajal, Mendy/Carreras, etc., but in general I think this is a strong lineup that could win both the league and the UCL. GG, Rodrygo, Camavinga, Huijsen, Asencio, Guler, Modric (remember, we should have kept him) can be the core of the rotations, although we still remain light in midfield, especially with Cama being injury-prone. Then we\u2019d still have Endrick, Ceballos, Brahim, and Fran to call on if needed.\n\n**I strongly feel like we should have gone in this direction**. However, we\u2019ve now seen quite a lot of worrying deviations from this **that don\u2019t make much sense:**\n\n\\- Insistence on playing a 4-3-3 instead of a 4-4-2 that clearly fits this team better, and is a cheat code for UCL knockout fixtures due to it being defensively solid and adding extra cover for players like Mbappe (or maybe Trent) that are defensively suspect.\n\n\\- Continuing from the above, we signed Mastantuono when we already have too many forwards. We should have signed a midfielder instead.\n\n\\- Letting go of Modric, leaving us even lighter in midfield, and losing out on his leadership and team spirit.\n\n\\- Not investing in the offensive dynamic between Vini and Mbappe from last season, the one that\u2019s also similar to Vini + Rodrygo &amp; Vini + Benz in a 4-4-2. Instead, it\u2019s a new system that seems to want Vini to strictly stay on the touchline while Mbappe plays completely central in a 4-3-3 (except Mbappe can also choose to leave his position whenever he wants, which is strange).\n\n\\- Continuing from the previous point. Xabi made bizarre decisions at the start of the season with Vini that showed a clear deviation from what we should have been trying to do. Once again, we should be emphasizing the strike partnership between Vini and Mbappe as much as possible and making them our core. They\u2019re our best players. However, so far the message Xabi has been sending is that Vini is replaceable and that he's setting up his team to play exclusively to Mbappe's strengths ALONE, while not playing to other players\u2019 strengths as well. Perhaps this started as an instruction from the board to punish Vini for his refusal to sign a contract, but ultimately it is a bad design for the team. This IMO has been a cause of low morale for Vini.\n\n\\- Trying to justify our lightness in midfield with the lie that Guler can play as an 8 or can be taught to be a Kroos replacement. This is just not true as he\u2019s not that kind of player. He\u2019s clearly a player that\u2019s very efficient and switched-on in the final third, but he doesn\u2019t have the possession-mindedness that we need in our \u201cKroos replacement.\u201d Imo our ideal setup involving Guler shouldn\u2019t have him tasked with deep midfielder duties. It should have him either play as a 10, or start more regularly in Valverde\u2019s position at RM, especially in games vs weaker teams that defend deep.\n\n\\- Not doing nearly enough to get the best out of players that would make us a complete team and give us options: GG, Rodrygo, Endrick, and even Mastantuono (even though he doesn\u2019t exist in my ideal formulation). For one, we have too many forwards. Secondly, Xabi hasn\u2019t been smart about giving these players enough minutes in good conditions to help them. A lot of this revolves around his determination to make Mbappe play every single 90, even those that are not necessary. Unfortunately, this has a ripple effect. Not only does this reduce the available minutes for these players, it\u2019s difficult to manage other players\u2019 minutes without drama because they can get upset about the double standard (rightfully so). Vini is an example of this. We\u2019ve managed to make every minute Rodrygo plays an attack against Vini, which hasn\u2019t helped either player. Compare this to managers that can promote a collaborative mentality even when players compete for spots, and there\u2019s a clear breakdown in communication here that needs to be fixed.\n\n**To conclude,** I believe most of these things are Xabi's responsibility to fix. So far, he doesn\u2019t seem to have managed to inspire love or respect like Zidane, Mourinho, or Ancelotti did did. He also hasn\u2019t introduced a particularly attractive brand of football. He hasn\u2019t given players like Endrick or GG a chance. No player seems to be performing better under him (besides Guler). He\u2019s not getting results on the pitch that leave us confident about our chances of winning the UCL and La Liga this season. So far his reign has been broken promises, contradictions, and bizarre decisions.\n\nI was very optimistic about his appointment, although there were some red flags. But so far he looks unconvinced about what he wants to implement. His vision is not clear on the pitch, and he doesn\u2019t seem to inspire our players off it. The best he\u2019s shown was in the CWC and the first few games of the season. The problem with those periods is that the formulas he used are not sustainable:  \n\\- **CWC**: Pre-Mbappe. We were decent but not particularly impressive. All in all, this was never sustainable because our best possible team IMO involves Mbappe, as I already outlined.  \n\\- **Early this season**: Good results from the Mbappe-centric style + Guler (who is perfect for it). While this could win games against average opposition, it requires dropping Vini + Bellingham, who are two of the best (and clutch) players in world football. This makes no sense IMO. We need these players if we\u2019re serious about winning and not just looking to flat-track bully weak opposition.\n\nI\u2019ll stop here, but I hope I provided at least some answers. I know I\u2019ve probably raised a few new questions as well, so feel free to ask away. I\u2019d be happy to discuss extra points (or even disagreements) in a kind manner. Thanks! ",

        "content": "Here's an example of why this couldn't be further from the truth:\n\nManchester City won a treble in 22/23 (in more dominant fashion than our double in 23/24) and yet last season most of their players were terrible. Now Ederson and Gundogan are playing in Turkey, Cancelo and Mahrez are playing in Saudi, De Bruyne and Rodri are injured all the time, Walker plays for the worst team in EPL, Grealish plays for Everton, others like Stones or Ake are washed, even Bernardo or Foden are nowhere as good as they used to be.\n\nApart from Haaland, the only ones who are as good or improved from their 22/23 squad are... Alvarez and Palmer, two players that ironically don't even play for them anymore.\n\nAnd this is just the most recent example, we've seen other teams winning trophies and then regressing a lot soon. Inter 2010, Chelsea 2021 are a couple of good examples. We've seen it with our own team as well. How good were the likes of Marcelo, Isco, Asensio, Varane etc. in 2018 and how these guys were performing a season or two or three later?\n\nI don't understand why people can't grasp the concept of players regressing, even if they won trophies in the near past. Doesn't matter if these players are in their 20s, don't have injury issues or they were very succesful recently. Dembele and Raphinha were both considered failures until a year ago, yet last season they were the two most influential players. Salah went from Ballon d'Or candidate to a completely painful to watch ghost of himself, in a matter of few months. Hazard was considered a top 10 player on earth when he joined us. Players get better and worse all the time, I know some people are too sentimental with our current squad, but it's time we should start accepting that fact, some players (not all of them) are already past their primes.",
