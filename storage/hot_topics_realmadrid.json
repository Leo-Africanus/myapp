The Dutchman says the club is fortunate to still be afloat.\n\nHe said on\u00a0*Ziggo Sports*:\u00a0\"On the one hand, it is heartbreaking that this can happen again, and that other clubs that really try to do their best and act fairly, as we have agreed, are affected. Barcelona, \u200b\u200bagain, seem to get away with it, but in reality it is crazy that this can happen, because if it were a normal company or something like that, it would have been declared bankrupt or disappeared a long time ago.\"\n\nRegarding the impact on the club's image, the Dutch footballer said: \"It's also ridiculous. It's becoming a real soap opera. Look, Barcelona will take advantage of anything to make sure they can count on Olmo. Victor too, but especially Olmo, because he's a very important player. I think Laporta is now under more pressure than ever, considering the absurdity of this situation. I don't know how all this will end, but it's deeply regrettable that a club as beautiful as Barcelona has to resort to these antics again and again.\"\n\nDe Boer also commented on the fact that Bar\u00e7a now display advertising on their shirts .\n\n\u201cNow they sell everything they can. It probably got too much to their heads. They wanted to keep competing with Real Madrid. And it was a constant desire for success. Then a new stadium, and this, and that, and it seemed like everything was possible. And they thought they could do it too. There was a period, of course, with Messi, Iniesta, Xavi and all those, where the sky was the limit. But it\u2019s not like that anymore. When you hear now that the new stadium has already been delayed, that they wanted it for November, but it won\u2019t be ready yet, it seems like there\u2019s no end in sight to all these problems.\u201d\n\n  \nSurprised no one here has seen this comment or posted it on rsoccer/ barcelona fan page.",

I expected a little better but I understand  it\u2019s hard to adjust to this pressure. I rank him as a 8/10 player. Hopefully we can get that prime mbappe back.",

Ceballos should also start, with either Valverde or Asensio on the right, as we can\u2019t afford to start the game with both Lucas and Mendy. Additionally, Vini and Mbapp\u00e9 must contribute defensively to avoid 2v1 situations against Yamal and Kound\u00e9.\n\nWe have all the ingredients to win this game.

The team makes a huge leap in the table from 18th to 13th, and leaves the relegation zone for the first time in months\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 19:30 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee**: Alejandro Morilla Turi\u00f3n\n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 2, Matchday 19\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[FEF TV](https://feftv.com) (subscription - 12.99\u20ac/month)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (5-2-3): Diego Pi\u00f1eiro - Youssef Enr\u00edquez \u2018Yusi\u2019 (83' Victor Valdepe\u00f1as 'Valde'), Mario Rivas, Jacobo Ram\u00f3n, Quique Ribes, David Jim\u00e9nez - Jos\u00e9 Maria Andr\u00e9s \u2018Chema\u2019, Manuel \u00c1ngel (68' Antonio David) - V\u00edctor Mu\u00f1oz (90' Edgar Pujol), Gonzalo Garc\u00eda, Pol Fortuny (83' Bruno Iglesias (90' Baba Diocou)) \n\nBench: Mario de Luis (GK). \n\nUnavailable: Fran Gonz\u00e1lez (first team call-up), Ra\u00fal Asencio (first team call-up), David Cuenca (pubalgia), David Ruiz (?), Loren Aguado (first team call-up), Andr\u00e9s Campos (?), C\u00e9sar Palacios (ACL tear), Borja Alonso (muscle injury), Jeremy de Le\u00f3n (ankle injury), Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga (muscle injury). \n\nCoach: Ra\u00fal\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** DWLWL\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 18th | 19pt | 4-7-7 | 27:22\n",
