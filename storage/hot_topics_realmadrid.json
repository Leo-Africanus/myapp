        "content": "After the Club World Cup ended, all of us Madridistas were happy about the emergence of a new striker \u2014 someone we thought we could rely on, at least as a backup, like Joselu in 2024 or Morata in 2017. I\u2019m talking here about Gonzalo Garc\u00eda.\n\nBut after 16 matches between La Liga and the Champions League, all I see is a player who doesn\u2019t play \u2014 and when he does, it\u2019s only for the last 3 or 4 minutes, either to waste time or to give Mbapp\u00e9 a brief rest so he doesn\u2019t get injured in the final moments.\n\nI understand that Mbapp\u00e9 is the best player in the world, and that he\u2019s untouchable \u2014 but even when you\u2019re the best, that doesn\u2019t mean you have every solution. When facing teams that defend deep inside their box, why not resort to what I like to call the \u201cJoselu card\u201d? A striker who can score with his head when all other options fail, who can play one-touch football and cause chaos for defenders inside the penalty area.\n\nWhy not move Mbapp\u00e9 to the left when Vin\u00edcius isn\u2019t performing well and bring on Gonzalo as a center forward? Why not even substitute Mbapp\u00e9 himself in the last 15 minutes when he\u2019s trapped and unable to make an impact? What\u2019s the point of having a classic number 9 \u2014 physically strong and good in the air \u2014 if you\u2019re not going to use him in matches like yesterday\u2019s?\n\nWe all thought Xabi Alonso trusted young players, but it turns out Mbapp\u00e9 was only absent during the Club World Cup. His handling of Gonzalo has been deeply disappointing.",

Comes on today, gets the ball, looks up, and sees fuck all movement up top. We acquired one of the most creative fullbacks in world football without a clear target man. \n\nThe only time our attackers do make runs into the box is on the counter. Problem is 99% of the teams in this league play ultra low block, so that\u2019s pretty much useless. Might as well send Trent back to Liverpool. ",

But now few months in the season we see big difference in quality again. Whenever Asencio plays he is playing without a mistake, tackling on time, fast, making a good passes everything that we thought Huijsen will be for this season. My opinion is that Xabi is unfair putting Huijsen ahead of him who since the injury he had he is not the same player and is playing without a confidence, i can\u2019t remember when he did something good without making 10 more mistakes after.  Asencio is our academy boy, he is in great form and i don\u2019t see a reason for him not to start with Militao. Xabi is just trying to prove that we didn\u2019t waste 40+ millions on Huijsen despite being so young.",

        "content": "I think we are almost 75% complete in rebuilding, but our main issue is with low block, and high pressing. Anyways xabi was making team play well with 3-4-3, but after CWC he changed to 433 or 442, we are very good defensively, exclude Liverpool and Athleti match, that may be due to inexperience in defensive line, but I am happy with overall defence, but during low block we need to play a proper striker.\n\nI guess board doesn't make him allow Playing 3-4-3, or maybe because of Mbappe's arrival.\n\nIn my opinion(this is purely my opinion): Vini has been dropping stinger on the left, its like he doesn't have a single braincell for decision making, dude has immense talent but his decision making is some times shit, taking on 3 players at once instead of passing and moving forward. I think instead of making Vini competing with Rodrygo, they should make Vini compete with Mbappe on Lw, and in striker Gonzalo or Endrick, or play Endrick in Right wing until Eminem comes back.\n\nYesterday we were just passing and passing and passing nothing in final 3rd, we were playing like headless chicken.\n\nI saw a post saying Perez supports Vini than Xabi, he didn't like the Vini Substitution, that's why we didn't see Vini get substituted. Xabi should be allowed to do whatever he wants, he is senor, and coach.\n\nOur team is good, but to be greatest only few more tweaks and that's it.",

But what do they want the new 9 to do? Isn't score goals? Or the idea is to replace Mbapp\u00e9 (which is what people are saying) with a 9 that assists? Isn't obvious that having the top scorer is a good thing.\n\nI get that Xabi should think about using a striker that dominates the aerial game, but that cannot be to replace Kylian, but to complement him.\n\nI honestly don't understand how so many people share this opinion. It's insane thinking being the top European scorer is somehow a bad thing.",

It\u2019s understandable somewhat because we had a good start of the season until now but recent performances cannot go unnoticed. \n\nTalking about today\u2019s game, holy shit was there even a game plan? And what were those subs? Not only were they so late but he brought on two players we absolutely didn\u2019t need for that game. We have Endrick and Franco who can play RW but he does Brahim and Rodrygo \ud83d\udc80 why did he even start. And wtf is the point of Trent coming on in the 85th minute? He should\u2019ve started let alone barely get anything. Bro was signed to watch from the sidelines. Valverde was holding his hamstring for like 10 minutes too. Mbappe must have Xabi hostage for being on that field for the full 90\n\nOnto the main point which is the 352. Most of our players had their best games in that formation. Trent as RWB, Valverde as RCM (we do NOT want to see him in the pivot again \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f), Tchoua as the CB/CDM hybrid role. Guler and Bellingham also played really well tg too, now they both just want to be 10s. After Endrick goes on loan we won\u2019t have a competent RW. And we actually had players inside of the box and aerial threat. Why has Xabi completely ditched this formation? It worked out so well and the players that we have are best fit for it, Xabi was seriously genius for setting it up like that. I don\u2019t know what goes on in his mind every time he plays 433 it just doesn\u2019t work with our team as it NEEDS creativity which we DON\u2019T HAVE! Does he watch the same games we are watching or is he in another universe?? I hope when he finally starts Trent (if he even does) he\u2019ll feel compelled to use it, maybe after the break when tchoua is also back. \n\nI want to iterate that I am not overreacting but just pointing out the flaws. I still trust in Xabi and know we will get better as the season goes on I just hope he has full control of the team and it\u2019s not Perez putting a gun to his head, or maybe should hope for that so we know it\u2019s not him lol and Perez gives him the freedom. A draw is a draw and we move on. Hala Madrid!",

They know the fellow superstars they\u2019re playing for. I think they\u2019re intelligent to know the whole is only as good as is parts and have been playing professional football long enough to know teamwork makes the dream work. It\u2019s not the players I want to discuss today, but the FANS of the individual players. Go on social media, all you\u2019ll see is Mbappe fans attacking Vini, Vini fans retaliating (and vice versa), then Arda fans jumping into the mix, with Jude fans ready to pounce as well. It\u2019s a shitstorm. We as a fanbase need to get it together and start uniting under the badge, not the individual players.",

        "title": "The potential solution to Xabi being put under pressure to play certain players and some amateur tactical analysis",
        "content": "So it's quite clear through multiple media outlets that Xabi Alonso at Madrid is being forced to start multiple players. Notably it appears to be Vini Jr, Mbappe and Bellingham. I'd say Bellingham is the least pressured out of this bunch, but the most I'd say are clearly Vini and Mbappe. \n\nAfter a draw away in the league and a loss in the UCL to a struggling Liverpool, it appears Xabi may have bit off more than he could chew in terms of formations.\n\nI've spoken a lot about the formation used in the Liverpool game. Playing Vinicius at right mid stalling the transition. Lack of midfielders actively fighting for the ball yet again killing the transition. Easy opportunities for Liverpool to win set pieces by barely pressing and giving them limitless channels to run into and so forth. It appears that formation was completely wrong and Xabi underestimated the size of the game. Liverpool had just lost to Galatasary. A club of their magnitude could not afford to lose again, every time we had possession, we were too slow to transition and build. This allowed them to drop back into a 4-4-2 and defend. The formation that day killed the game, and anyone who puts it on the players needs to rewatch the game. There were certain players (Vini, Arda, Bellingham and Camavinga) who clearly looked out of position and didn't look as fluid as in their regular spots.\n\nThere's been a lot of talks about aerial threat and whilst this is a great talking point, it's being blown out of proportion. In last years UCL campaign, most goals were scored by foot, by a large margin. They do not have a tall aerial threat. Dembele is tall but by no means is he threatening defences aerially. He always prefers the ball at his feet. To address some other interesting statements, their entire front 3 was wingers, and they went on to win the UCL, and dominate top European sides at that. \n\nWhat I think Xabi needs to try if we want a striker option to make best use of Vinicius Jrs good crossing / passing ability from out wide. Not only will this improve Vini's game, but it'll improve Trent's too. As well as Tchouameni's, Militaos and Bellingham's.\n\n4-3-3 \n\nWe go with the usual back 4, Carreras, Huijsen, Militao / Asencio and instead of Valverde, Trent. \n\nIn the midfield, Guler, Bellingham and Tchouameni. \n\nUp top, Vini, Gonzalo, Mbappe. \n\nThis gives Trent the option to feed long, low balls out to Mbappe as he'll be on the right wing, like he did for Salah at Liverpool. Furthermore in long possession spells he can push up and deliver long balls into the box for Tchouameni, Gonzalo, Huijsen, Bellingham and Militao. Gonzalo's presence in the middle of the front 3 also provides options to Vinicius Jr as he is a touchline winger who thrives with the presence of a striker. We've seen Gonzalo and Vini link up in the past. Vini has also linked up with arguably one of the best 9's of our generation, he knows how to play around a striker. He contributed massively to Karim's Balon D'or charge. The 4-3-3 will prevent our players sitting too deep and will actually get us involved in the midfield battle, so we can play quick transition football rather than hold up the ball in our own 3rd after sitting back and surviving attacks. \n\nThis may not work, but I'd like to see it tested as it may answer a lot of options for us. With balance in the front 3, two quick wingers and a tall natural 9, bred from our own academy at that, we could become seriously threatening. This could be a much more reliable way of breaking down low blocks, occupying defenders and creating danger from every side of the pitch. Trent can overlap Mbappe if needed. Carreras can overlap Vini as he has been. \n\nI hope Xabi tries this out at some point as it could seriously result in some beautiful football. The best part? He hasn't got to bench anyone the board forces him to start.\n\nHala Madrid!\n",

        "content": "We should\u2019ve kept Modric for one more year\n\nOur Rayo starting 11 average age was 24.1. We lack experience and a deep lying playmaker. He wouldn\u2019t need to play every game but we are missing him. He would\u2019ve been important at Rayo in a champions league week. We got rid of him so we could buy Stiller or Zubi and we never did. Should\u2019ve kept him until we sealed one of those deals. He would\u2019ve still dropped masterclasses for us. Dropping Modric and keeping Ceballos was not wise. Even though Ceballos was a drama queen and we tried to move him on \n\nWe won\u2019t bring modric back cuz it\u2019s too late. But we need to bring in some experience. Maybe Bernardo Silva from City? Kimmich? Calhanoglu? Anyone over 30 who still plays regularly ",

        "content": "I keep seeing people say that mbappe's the reason why vini isn't performing as well as he used to, are we serious? When mbappe was in the worst form of his life last season, vini was still playing insanely well, and as a matter of fact that was probably his best start to a season (idk for sure, I don't feel like checking). My point is, vini was carrying this team at the beginning of last season but then after he got injured around november/ December, he's been nowhere near that level. Even in the CWC when he had Gonzalo next to him he was even worse than he is right now. His decision making has dropped significantly along with his passing, which is tragic but it's the truth. So blaming mbappe for that is just cope. Vini still has his good games every once in a while but in general he's been average for a whole year now, I hope he can bounce back but that might not happen.",
