It will be decided tomorrow if he is fit to train. Although medical staff are confident that he is fine. \n\n  \nBellingham was limping yesterday but he is fine. It was just a cramp from the match after playing for 90 minute. \n\n  \nTrent is not going to play against barcelona as he is yet to participate in group training.

        "content": "What do you think, does Alonso have the courage to bench Vin\u00edcius after yet another poor performance? Vini showed nothing last night, and he should be leading the attack when Mbappe is unavailable. If Kylian is fit for Sunday, why not start him on the left wing, Rodrygo on the right, and put Garcia back up front?\n\nGarcia didn\u2019t have many chances last night, but he played very well both centrally and defensively, helping the team a lot, while Vinicius\u2019 contribution was invisible both offensively and defensively.\n\nBarcelona are currently in better form, but they defend counterattacks very poorly and play with a high line. I think the smartest move if Kylian is ready would be to start with him and Rodrygo.",
