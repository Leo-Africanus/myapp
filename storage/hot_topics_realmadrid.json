        "content": "Some people in this sub thinks Bellingham have no talent. What's your view? Cause how come a player with no talent outperforms players like pedri/vitinha in almost 90% of criteria stats.\n\nAnd I feel so frustrated when players say Bellingham has no technicality I mean are they even watch Some things he done on the field are so magical I can't even explain.\n\nFirst of all he is so press resistant, stays unbothered and can place a perfect pass breaking the press even if he is pressed by 5 people.\n\nBall carrying ability of him is so top notch. As soon as he starts to drive with the ball centrally opportunity starts opening up.\n\nAnd Tbh he is a solid dribbler other midfielders like vitinha, pedri, mac allister can't dribble past players like he does, even stats confirm this.\n\nHis first touch is so underrated I mean, he touched a ball in the air makesit bounce two times once on his knees second time on his foot (while doing a 360 and blistering pass players)\n\nHis tackles and defending is soo good I mean almost on par with likes of tchoumani who are proper dm's.\n\nRuns around the pitch. His tackles in the final third already made us there chance in prvs two matches.\n\nHe scores and assists more than a CAM He is as much press resistant and technical as much a ball playing CM. Defends more than a pivot.\n\nHow do people even come up with Bellingham just runs and does nothing it's pure bullshit.",
