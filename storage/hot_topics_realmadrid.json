        "content": "#2nd half: JUVENIL A 0:2 AZ \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#UEFA YOUTH LEAGUE \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:**\n\n0:1 Wassim Bouziane 30'\n\n0:2 Anthony Smits 87'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - kickoff, vamos! \n\n3' - the earlier matches just finished, and if they pass,  the team will face Man City's U19s in the quarter final\n\n8' - DISGRACEFUL by the AZ player, who tries putting pressure on our keeper \u00c1lvaro and elbows him in the face fully on purpose - no card given, it should've easily been a red \n\n11' - now van de Ban, the same player who should've seen red sees a yellow for a late tackle - so even if the refs had spotted it but not deemed it on purpose, it would've been a second yellow now\n\n20' - first chances for Juvenil A - Jacobo connects with a cross from the left by Aguado, but his shot is wide - Y\u00e1\u00f1ez' shot from outside the box is easily saved by the keeper\n\n\u26bd 30' - pretty much the first arrival at our box by AZ and the goal arrives, always the same story - our defenders let an AZ player enter the box easily, \u00c1lvaro saves his shot but parries it away badly to Bouziane in the box, Rivas leaves him all the time in the world to take the ball down and shoot, leaving \u00c1lvaro without a chance on the rebound\n\n36' - yellow for Diego Aguado who trips the AZ player, he was technically the last man, but the ball was going towards the corner flag. We are not defending well on the counter \n\n41' - Penalty for Juvenil A after the AZ player slips and basically buries the ball under his arms\n\n42' - de Llanos with awful fan, easy save for the keeper, then Y\u00e1\u00f1ez misses the rebound... What is wrong with this team...\n\n44' - HOW?? Triple chance from a very short distance after a corner... De Llanos' shot is blocked, then Jacobo Ortega's shot is saved by the keeper with a great reaction, and a third shot from an even shorter distance is cleared off the line, unbelievable \n\n45'+1 - Roberto is semingly tripped in the box, referee doesn't point to the spot, but it looks like Roberto is injured \n\nHT - Just unbelievable that the team is not only not leading comfortably, but trailing after this first half... An awful penalty by de Llanos, multiple wasted chances including an incredible triple chance, and AZ score with their first attack after bad goalkeeping... It feels like every year we see these same type of matches in UYL, this utter dominance is not enough if the players don't stay composed in the key moments\n\n46' - 2nd half underway \n\n47' - \u00c1lvaro parries a shot away for a corner, but it would've went wide anyway \n\n62' - next incredible miss... Corner that Jacobo Ram\u00f3n perfectly redirects onto de Llanos, who only has to head it into the net, but puts it far wide from a short distance... \n\n\ud83d\udd04 62' - Jacobo Ortega off for Thiago Pitarch\n\n66' - next big chance, great play through the middle where de Llanos lays it off to Roberto Mart\u00edn, he has space to aim for the corner inside the box, but he puts it straight at the keeper... \n\n71' - Free kick in a central position, but Roberto Mart\u00edn puts it wide\n\n\ud83d\udd04 76' - Pol Rivera for Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez... Time is starting to run out\n\n81' - headers by Rivas and Valde go wide after corners, but the team is not creating enough danger right now... \n\n\ud83d\udd04 83' - last sub and it's an attacking one, Barroso for Cestero\n\n85' - I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHIG LIKE IT - multiple blocked shots, Roberto gets some space and shoots, the keeper saves it, but it drops for Valdepe\u00f1as, who only needs to tap it into the empty net, but he puts it wide! \n\n\u26bd 87' - Goal for AZ with their first chance in this half too... I've never, ever, ever seen anything like it \n\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 16:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee:** Milo\u0161 Milanovi\u0107 (SRB) \n\n**Competition:** UEFA Youth League, Round of 16, Single-leg \n\n**Viewing options:** [RMTV/RM Play (potentially VPN needed)](https://www.realmadrid.com/real-madrid-tv)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Juvenil A XI (5-2-3):** \n\u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez - V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as \u2018Valde\u2019, Diego Aguado, Jacobo Ram\u00f3n, Mario Rivas, Jes\u00fas Fortea - Jorge Cestero (83' Jaime Barroso), Roberto Mart\u00edn - Hugo de Llanos, Jacobo Ortega (62' Thiago Pitarch), Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (76' Pol Rivera) \n\nBench: Diego Arroyo (GK), Melvin Ukpeigbe, Lamini Fati, \u00c1lvaro Lezcano, Izan Regueira, Aimar Santiago. \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n\n**UYL League Phase stats:** 6th | 12pt | 4-0-2 | 10:5\n",

Arda Guler has been trash all season and we saw how Endrick is not yet a starter-level player. Vinicius and Mbapp\u00e9 are two of the best players in the world, we need to relax and stop changing our opinions every single week. Y'all only remember the good moments and forget that Ronaldo, Bale, Benzema etc all had bad games at times. So stop getting mad at our two best players, and wait until Vini and Mbappe start to cook.",

        "content": "He might not be the best player in squad but for sure I know he gives his best for the club and the badge. Always tries to give 110%, that's what I like in a Madrid player. It's a shame he is not able to play a lot more because of Rodrygo and Bellingham. I was thinking with Ceballos out, we could do someone with as good composure as Brahim. I know he is more of an attacker, but Camavinga isn't cutting it atm and Modric is old. Ancelotti is known for making players work in different position so he could do it with Brahim too? ",

        "content": "Fans have said many times how they wished he was left footed. I think that among our three right-footed attackers, he has the best left foot. Tonight's goal was evidence of that. If he trains his left foot consistently, he could even develop into an ambipedal player, which would elevate his technical ability to absurd levels.\n\nThat is, of course, if he feels the need to. Beginning to train your weak foot well into your career can be an exhausting process and it could take years for him to feel comfortable enough to just control the ball with his left in a real game. However, given that he (hopefully) stays with us for many years playing on the right, he's gonna be put in more and more situations where he NEEDS to use it like he did tonight.\n\nNaturally, he should get better with time, but I'd love to one day see him fire a rocket into the net with his left. It's practically a tradition for our number 11s.",

        "content": "So on time we discuss how bad is our defense and this thing overshadows the fact that our attack isn't any good either in comparison to last season.\n\nI believe and it's literally stated by every big pundits and analysts we rely heavily on the individual brilliance if we consider this recent champions league match against Atletico both goals were scored from individual brilliance by rodrygo and brahim respectively and that's been the case mostly this season with real madrid. Atletico players very able to get in between lines by passing brilliantly and when our player try to do the same either we hold the ball for too long and closed down by opponents or loose it with sloppy passing/control. Madrid don't seems to perform well against team that defends well because the player don't connect together the way they should and we faced the issue against teams like Atletico, Athletic Club, Lille, Liverpool, Milan.  \nLast season was different in ucl I don't think any team was this good defensively other than city but we did get past against them again by individual brilliance. The thing is the individual brilliance and late winner worked a lot for us last season almost in every match when we need them but this season nothing is working our way.  \nCeballos did give us control in the game but now he is injured and will be so for a long time.  \nIn the meantime we might need a solution for it someone who can fill in the shoe in absence of Ceballos that can be looked up to and improved. But sadly the decision making up front can't on days vini/mbappe seems to be a force hard to reckon but as soon as the ships finds a hole they hit rock bottom they need to up there game.\n\nI know I am no one to tell these things to players but it's just my analysis(pov) on our current attacking form what's yours?\n\nEdit: People replying in comments are mostly focusing on the vini/mbappe chemistry but I've written more than that real madrid unable to break lines against low block and I don't think changing the system will do much good as if we played mbappe on left against liverpool they defended well and mbappe didn't do anything rememberable also vini regularly plays on left sometime central. And I am sure they will get there form back and this difficult phase will be passed soon.",
