I just (ish) got back from the Club World Cup, and spent a lot of time with the team / media all around the US, and got a chance to ask a ton of questions of Xabi / the players.\n4. My favourite player ever is Raul.\n5.

We play a diamond midfield, which needs four midfielders to start  and we barely have enough, let alone backups.\n\nEven if Xabi uses Mastantuono at CAM, that still gives us just one reserve midfielder. Meanwhile, we have 10 defenders in the squad. It just doesn\u2019t make sense. Why aren\u2019t we signing any midfielders?

We are clearly willing to let Rodrygo go, he has proven himself on the big stage and is also more marketable than these players.\n\nIf a one season player like Ekitike goes for 70-80+ from Frankfurt.

For example, this is like [the 3rd post ](https://x.com/kingbeofguler/status/1948120928120098839)I've seen in the past few hours alone with alot of likes trying to create a rift among Real Madrid fans. I seriously dont understand this No. 10 drama. Arda had only a couple of months of starter level minutes what has he done to deserve the no. 10? It took Yamal 2 years of consistent performances to get the no. 10. \n\nOn the other hand, despite a few rough months at the start. Mbappe played out of his mind and managed to get the Golden boot which is something that only  happened to 2 players in Real Madrid history before Mbappe, on his first season. Imagine if he adapted from the start, he would have had some record breaking numbers.\n\nThis Vini Vs. Mbappe drama is also not something the team needs right now, they need to be partners and not rivals. Mbappe has managed to adapt the central forward role and it is something that Xabi Alonso clearly wants to continue with. He wants out forwards to be more centrally and our wing backs and Midfielders to overload the wings. Mbappe just needs to work on his work rate cuz everything else he has been amazing at.\n\nThe point is that the community and the players need more unity otherwise we are lose. The players will have another bad season and the fans will be dissapointed. \n\nI'm sorry but these things are less important than getting silverware. I'm starting to think that people are more like Vini and Arda fanboys than Real Madrid fans. ",

        "content": "After hearing the news about isak wanting to leave, I feel like we would have a reason to sigh him. However this would be a major shakeup in the team. Obviously we cannot have all 3 of Vinicius, Mbappe, and isak. And in my opinion, isak and Mbappe are the future. We sell Vini to a good option and make an easy 150+ Mil. This money can be put towards isak and have a left over 30 or more million to go towards another midfielder or CB. We then push Mbappe out left where he very clearly thrives, and have isak down the middle as our true benzema replacement and true number 9 that Mbappe currently is not. I am never one to say Vini out as he has done so much for us as a club, but I feel this opportunity would be too good to pass up. Please let me know why this would not work if you disagree. Thanks!",

        "content": "Did we really need to sign mbappe at all ? I mean don't get me wrong he is a great player but lets be honest this signing seems more like a sporting signing more than a tactical signing .. We already had vinicius who was a LW anyways , even rodrygo , now Some often say mbappe didint disrupt our squad tomi kroos leaving did but again some will glady say again \" real madrid played terrible last season we didint control any games we were dominated carlo should be sacked\" so exactly how does it make sense that you say toni kroos controlled everything but then you say we were dominated in every game ? We have to admit 1 of vinicius amd mbappe has to leave and it won't be mbappe since he just arrived otherwise we will always be unbalanced our last game against proved it .. there is some ego in the dressing room .. vinicius wouldn't be asking for 30m if mbappe didint arrive lets be honest here.. if vinicius somehow scams madrid for 30m per season jude will ask for 35m per seaso  , then mbappe will ask for 40m per season then the salaru structure gets ruined.",

We do not want to pay 120 million for Mac or Enzo because it is seen as too expensive. However, we are totally content with spending 100 million to sign Rodri who is almost 30 and is coming from a big injury. Not only does Rodri have beef with the club, but he is also a gamble just like stiller. We do not know if he will recover and be worth the price. Going for Rodri sounds more like a marketing strategy than actually going for a valuable player to me. Florentino seems to love Ballon D\u2019or winners, but I hope it doesn\u2019t go through. Rodri was an exceptional player but paying 100m for him now sounds like too big of a risk.",
