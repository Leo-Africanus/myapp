He said unfortunately he didnt but had #5 along with others i dont remember but of course as soon as i heard #5 (Zidane) i was ecstatic &amp; had to get that one.

        "content": "I grew up in India and started following Real Madrid since I was just **12 years old.** At that time whoever started supporting European football (in my social circles) had basically 2 choices \ud83d\ude06 Either Real Madrid or Barcelona. Might get some flak for this but this is exactly how it was... My love for Real started from the fact that when I bought my first FIFA, FIFA 13.. It was so easy to play as Real, direct passing, pace on the counter attack and amazing shots. Simple yet elegant football. And thats where I started following our incredible UCL nights. 1st season was tough, Lewandowski put 4 against us and Dortmund knocked us out. \n\nBut the moment I shall never forget is next year when Ramos put past his 92:48 header against Courtois. My screams waking everyone up at **3 AM IN THE MORNING!!**\n\nTheres been no looking back since that. Countless nights have I spent following and cheering on for Real, what a pleasure it has been (6 UCL Titles in 11 Seasons) I wouldn't have it any other way. My cupboard is full of Real jerseys, to the point where my friends are sick of seeing me wear white.\n\nIt has been my **biggest dream** to visit Madrid and watch Real Madrid play at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u. Now, after years of supporting this club from afar, I\u2019m finally making it happen.\n\nI have since shifted to Dubai for my college and started earning last year in Dubai after finishing my degree, been saving up every month because this trip is the **highest thing on my bucket list**. I\u2019m planning to fly to Madrid in November 2025 for my **25th birthday** and stay for a week. Preferably I want to visit during a **Champions League week**. The plan is to be in Madrid for two matchdays\u2014one I\u2019ll experience in a local pub with other fans, and the other I\u2019ll watch live at the Bernab\u00e9u. **Ideally, I\u2019d love to get tickets for the UCL match, but if that\u2019s not possible, a La Liga game would still be amazing.**\n\nI\u2019d love some help from anyone who has done this before\u2014how much should I budget for the full experience?\n\n* **Flights** (Dubai to Madrid, round trip) : showing around 920 USD\n* **Visa costs** (Indian UAE resident applying for a Schengen visa) : Not sure\n* **Accommodation** (mid-range hotel or Airbnb, ideally near the Bernab\u00e9u or city center) \n* **Match tickets** (What\u2019s a good estimate for a great seat? Best time to buy?)\n* **Bernab\u00e9u Tour** (I want the full experience\u2014what's the best option?)\n* **Food &amp; transport** (How much do I need per day to enjoy the city?)\n* **Any hidden costs or must-do experiences I should consider?**\n\nThis trip means **everything** to me, and I want to plan it right. Any insights, cost breakdowns, or pro tips would be massively appreciated.\n\nGracias in advance, and Hala Madrid y nada m\u00e1s! \u26aa\u2728",

        "title": "Why do we rarely score from corners?",
        "content": "Might be a stupid question to ask, but I think it has been a long time since I have seen a corner scored directly via a header. I don\u2019t even remember when it happened last. Now I don\u2019t have the exact stats for this season but I feel it is extremely low. \n\nMy point is we have rudiger, tchouameni, bellingham even asencio who are tall mfs and it seems like still we are not able to convert even once direct from a corner, regardless of the opposition capability to defend corners.\n\nI think we get scored against via corners much more than scoring ourselves.\n\nIs it the delivery, heading ability, or just bad luck.\n\nAlso, I know corners are not beautiful to watch, but its great to have a goal from them when the game is not going in your favour (which is happening more often this season)",
