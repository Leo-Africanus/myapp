        "content": "Liverpool in 2011 and Benfica in 2026: Clubs defending players accused of racism. Loyalty or liability?\n\nIn 2011, Luis Su\u00e1rez was banned for 8 matches after racially abusing Patrice Evra. Liverpool players then wore shirts with his image during warm-ups. This decision shocked fans and sparked widespread criticism. At the time, social media was smaller and outrage more contained, but it still left a lasting mark on the club\u2019s reputation.\n\nFast forward to 2026: Benfica is defending Gianluca Prestianni after UEFA\u2019s anti-racism protocol was triggered in their Champions League match against Real Madrid. The club posted on social media emphasizing support for their player and casting doubt on the reports from Vin\u00edcius Jr.\n\nWhat stands out is the tension clubs face between **internal cohesion** and **external pressure**. On one hand, they want to protect their players, preserve locker room trust, and maintain authority internally. On the other, public perception, social media scrutiny, and the risk of reputational or commercial damage are enormous\u00a0 far larger than in 2011.\n\nBoth incidents show how clubs try to balance loyalty with accountability, often under the microscope of global audiences. It raises the question: are clubs prioritizing the right thing, or are short-term optics and internal politics still overshadowing moral responsibility?\n\n**Benfica Posts Links:**\n\n[https://x.com/SLBenfica/status/2023935602693915020?s=20](https://x.com/SLBenfica/status/2023935602693915020?s=20)\n\n[https://x.com/SLBenfica/status/2023943527906844839?s=20](https://x.com/SLBenfica/status/2023943527906844839?s=20)\n\n  \n",

It\u2019s funny how many liked to claim that he had \u201cno tactics\u201d. Then we got a tactics coach in Xabi and he did not even last a full season. Ancelotti always knew what he was doing and how to manage the locker room. The more time goes on, the more I appreciate and understand his way of thinking. The only reasonable flaw I see in him is his tendency to not play youth players. Besides that, he always knew how to manage the team and how to adapt to the players. ",

Otamendi y Prestianni en vez de jugar comenzaron a agredir a Vinicius, el equipo de mierda ese no hizo un solo tiro al arco toda la segunda parte, estoy harto, y es muy triste, porque estoy segur\u00edsimo que si Vinicius jugara en cualquier otro equipo del mundo no tendr\u00edamos que ver estos lamentables episodios, odiar el Madrid se volvi\u00f3 el escudo para su racismo y para su cobard\u00eda, siempre con Vini, siempre y ojal\u00e1 al Benfica le metan 10 en la vuelta, equipo de ratas, siendo que el mejor jugador de su historia es Eusebio, vaya iron\u00eda.",
