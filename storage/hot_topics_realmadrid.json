        "content": "People blame Pintus and luck, but how many more injuries are we going to suffer, because Ancelotti refuses to protect his most important players, even when we're 3-0 up?\n\n* Vini got a muscle injury after playing 90 minutes every game, including the international break (+travelling). Despite the comfortable lead, only 3 subs were made yesterday.\n* Rodrygo suffered a muscle (hamstring) injury in the last 5 minutes of the Dortmund game. Only one sub had been made until that point.\n* Carvajal tore his ACL in the last minute of the Villareal game. We were comfortably winning 2-0, yet Ancelotti had made only 3 subs, one of which was due to another injury (Vini).\n\nAnother example is Militao. He finished the season \"fully\" recovered from his ACL injury and then played pretty much every single minute for Brazil in the Copa America. Then full 90 vs Atalanta. Then 10/11 starts before the Osasuna game, 9 of which were full 90 minutes. And 3/4 starts in the UCL. That's almost zero rest for a player that was out the whole season with a very serious injury, it was inevitable that he was gonna suffer another one sooner or later, sadly it was yet another very serious one.\n\nWhile many might argue that injuries can happen anytime, even in training or during summer friendlies, there's enough evidence that overplayed players tend to be more vulnerable, because they're exhausted. I'm seriously scared for players like Rudiger and Valverde, because I don't see those guys getting rest anytime soon.\n\nI don't understand why Ancelotti rarely uses his 5 subs and barely rotates. Yes, we have issues with the squad (lack of CBs most notably), but it's not like a bench/academy player will score 3 own goals if he plays for 10-15 minutes. See how good Asencio has been for us in the last couple of games? Or rotational players like Arda, Fran and Ceballos? With the extra number of games, other teams and managers seem to want bigger and bigger squads, to deal with the problem. Meanwhile we have a small squad, barely trust our bench and never trust our academy players. And no, you don't need billions to build a huge squad and rotate, like City or Chelsea do. Teams like Dortmund, Juventus, Barcelona etc. rely on their academies. Teams like Inter sign a lot of free players. There are solutions, I wish Ancelotti (and Perez) could see them.",

        "content": "So share your thoughts and views for the upcoming UCL game against Liverpool. On the basis of today's match and international matches what changes team should make?\n\nOur midfield really looked good today. Bellingham was good as always, scored a goal too &lt;3. Arda did fantastic. Fede's goal was brilliant. \n\nAlthough there were not much attacking threat from Leganes, defence looked better. Mbapp\u00e9 scored a goal but was still meh imo, he played in the left wing today. ",

But following the strong start from Barcelona in La Liga, I started to watch their games too, not every game, but when I find time.\n\nAnd I always root for the other team! I enjoyed yesterday's match very very much.",
