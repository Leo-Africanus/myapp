        "content": "That was when the squad was fully fit \u2014 when Milit\u00e3o was leading the defense and delivering outstanding performances; when Carvajal and Arnold were both available on the right back; when Valverde wasn\u2019t forced to abandon his midfield role to compensate for their absence; when Huijsen was playing regularly and with consistent form.\n\nAll of that happened when the entire team stood behind the coach \u2014 when we watched our team playing with aggression and high spirit. From the very first match at the Club World Cup, we all noticed how quickly the team recovered the ball after losing it, the tactical discipline in executing the high press, and the immense physical effort every player put in \u2014 including forwards and midfielders fulfilling their defensive duties.\n\nEverything was ideal. Yes, we weren\u2019t the most entertaining or the most complete team, but we were winning. We were convincing. We were watching a real, united team on the pitch. We were winning without needing Courtois\u2019 decisive, heroic saves like we see in recent matches.\n\nThe change and the decline began when every viewer started to feel that the team had become disjointed, and that the players\u2019 personalities had begun to overshadow the coach\u2019s authority. Ego started to rule Real Madrid \u2014 that is the truth.\n\nWhen Vin\u00edcius started laughing and shouting when being substituted; when Bellingham became angrier on the pitch; when everyone noticed Valverde\u2019s dissatisfaction while playing at right-back; the Rodrygo drama and his lack of goals; the Arda G\u00fcler drama and his rivalry with Bellingham \u2014 and on top of all that, the injuries and absences that truly devastated the team.\n\nReal Madrid were excellent, even if not perfect, at the start of the season \u2014 18 wins out of 21 matches. Even the two defeats against Paris and Atl\u00e9tico came mainly from individual mistakes (let\u2019s remember what Asencio and R\u00fcdiger did early in the match against PSG).\n\nAnd before you say our opponents were weak, let me remind you that those 18 wins included Barcelona, Juventus, Dortmund, Villarreal, Marseille \u2014 as well as several particularly tough matches in La Liga.\n\nYes, Xabi Alonso was not perfect. We didn\u2019t understand many of his in-game choices and decisions. But it is impossible for me to believe that Xabi is the problem when, with a united and fully fit squad, we witnessed one of the best starts to a Real Madrid season in years.",

If a player like valverde who sacrificed his position for like 3 times in 3 different season and bellingham who literally played with dislocated shoulder for 2 years are getting scapegoat then honestly you should stop supporting real madrid. These are some of the best time for media to boost their clicks and us madridistas should ignore it and support our team and back our new manager. All the best to xabi and his staff but the chapter of him with us is over and we should move on. Onto copa del rey tomorrow. HALA MADRID Y NADA MAS",

I have seen alot of players come and go, but I have never seen a player have this much power.\n\n\\- His tantrum when he got subbed in El Classico going unpunished. Salah who is a bigger legend relatively speaking for Liverpool than Vini for us gets punished while in our team, the manager gets sacked while the player goes unpunished.\n\n\\- Constantly complaining to the ref over every single incident. Even during the final, his first instinct was to complain to the ref instead of pressing the defenders.\n\n\\- Using Xabi Alonso as an ultimatum for not signing a renewal contract\n\n\\- Vini not getting benched no matter how badly he performed or how badly he acted. We never was able to see a Mbappe LW with Gonazlo ST because of how much power a player has.\n\n\\- Vini had a problem with Xabi from the start because Xabi wanted to start Mbappe on the LW and have Garcia as ST in the CWC. (source, SQuirante)\n\n\\- The Balon D'or gate. The club deciding to embarrass themselves in protest because Vini got snubbed. I have a controversial opinion but imo Vini's Balon shout was probably the weakest for players in his position. He never ever pulled stats like Mbappe or last season's Raphinha.\n\nImagine if the club gave power to Xabi to decide what to do best for the team.\n\nIt may probably have to do with his marketability but honestly speaking, Vini is disliked by almost every non-Real Madrid fan due to his antics on the pitch.\n\nIt drives me crazy that we never were able to see Xabi's vision for the team because players had to much power and on top of that the constant injuries.\n\nEven Bale who in my opinion was a better player and bigger legend than Vini did not hold this much power in the team.",

What I cannot accept is sacking Xabi Alonso instead of actually fixing the real problems at this club.\n\nThat\u2019s weak leadership from the board. Xabi wasn\u2019t the problem. Lack of support was. No clear backing, no patience, players with too much power and the coach takes the fall as always.\n\nThis club talks about \u201cproject\u201d and \u201cfuture,\u201d but panics the moment things go wrong. You don\u2019t build anything serious by sacrificing the manager every time.\n\nIf the board wants a yes-man who keeps the dressing room comfortable, then fine keep Carlo forever. But don\u2019t pretend this is about football or performance. This is about protecting egos.\n\nI\u2019m disappointed. Not because we lost to Barca but because we learned nothing from it.",
