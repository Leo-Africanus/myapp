Some people are truly ungrateful, entitled, lowlifes, and it's sad to see.\n\nAnd the irony is, for most of them if they saw him in real life, they'd be begging him for a selfie just so they could show it off to their friends and feel better about their lives.\n\nShow some dignity and grace. If you're upset because your friends are trolling you, grow up already. Did you really think you were going to win everything for the rest of your life? You're watching sports\u2014sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. Most people learn that by the age of five.\n\nI think the man is doing his best.

        "title": "We Need To Talk About Jude In This Team",
        "content": "Jude has been the most important player in this squad both this season and last. Vini insane last season and Valverde now but Jude shades both for me and should have won the Ballon d\u2019or last year due to those national performances with a dysfunctional England team too, if he was properly backed and not Vini. That's not important though. This season, the way he\u2019s been contributing across every area of the game is something we rarely see, not just in Madrid but anywhere in world football. He\u2019s been asked to do practically everything: controlling the midfield, creating chances, scoring goals, defending, pressing, covering for fullbacks\u2014it\u2019s a long list, and he\u2019s consistently delivered in all of them. But while his versatility is a huge asset, the way he\u2019s been used recently hasn\u2019t always brought out his best qualities.\n\nTake the first leg against Arsenal. He was dropped into deeper and wider roles to try to stabilize a shaky midfield, and while he put in a shift and performed, like he always does, it limited his ability to dictate the game or contribute in the final third. Compare that to matches like Valencia or Real Sociedad, where he was positioned more centrally and advanced. In those games, he created chances, controlled the tempo, linked up with the attack, and even got into the box to score. We\u2019ve seen that when he\u2019s given freedom to play higher up the pitch, the team looks far more dangerous and cohesive.\n\nWhat makes Jude stand out, though, isn\u2019t just his versatility. It\u2019s the level he\u2019s performing at in every part of the game\u2014defending, passing, creating, finishing, pressing, and more. He\u2019s the midfielder who plugs gaps everywhere, filling roles his teammates can\u2019t, and yet he\u2019s still delivering at an elite level in his own right. Look at his press-resistance, for instance: in tight games where opponents try to suffocate our midfield, Jude is often the one who finds a way through with his composure and technical skill. Add to that his workrate, his physicality, and his ability to make late runs into the box, and it feels weird sometimes how we can\u2019t win games more easily.\n\nThis is part of why Jude hate baffles me. When he\u2019s asked to play higher up, people complain about a lack of midfield control. When he\u2019s tasked with more defensive running, it\u2019s \u201cwhere are the goals and assists?\u201d But the reality is, Jude is taking on more responsibility than almost anyone else in the team, and often he\u2019s compensating for gaps in the system or poor performances around him. Other midfielders are given clear roles and expectations; Jude is the one making up for deficiencies everywhere. The idea he has PR at this point or is any way overrated baffles me considering takes on him get wilder by the day and media and fans go out of their way to drag him after any bad Madrid performance regardless of how he did or if he does anything that shows literally any emotion or even media skills. Guess it\u2019s just playing for Madrid though\n\nThis is exactly why the system has to be built around him. Not in a way that overburdens him, but in a way that lets him influence the game where it matters most\u2014controlling the midfield, creating chances, and being a goal threat, all while being supported by a cohesive structure that doesn\u2019t demand he do everything at once. When the team gives him the freedom and support he needs, he lifts everyone else around him.\n\nIf we want to secure big wins at all like completing a comeback against Arsenal, winning all the big games we just get owned in like the CDR final, or comfortably winning those smaller ones as we should, it\u2019s going to depend on Jude being at the heart of things. Not as a utility player filling holes wherever needed, but as the focal point of a system that maximizes his strengths and builds around the best midfielder itw. Love Carlo for all he\u2019s done but this season it\u2019s been on him plenty and why I imagine someone else could do a better job along with many other flaws in this team.",

        "title": "The board dealt us a shit hand, and expected the manager to pull a rabbit out of his hat, for the 2nd year straight.",
        "content": "Could Carlo had better managed the team this season. Yes, maybe be more rigid in terms of discipline, tactics, game subs. But my god, you're telling me the same manager who just 1 season ago, won the double with 2Ls all season all of a sudden forgot how to coach ? Come on now people, let's not be this naive.\n\nAll wee needed to do in the summer of 2024 was make 4 transfers to plug in for the departures and maybe 1 extra.\n\n\\- Kroos leaving meant we had to get another CM/CDM who's is actually similar. No need for yet another tall, physical lad like Tchouameni. Someone with a Kimmich/Zubimendi kind of profile. A guy who may not be the most physical, or defensively sound, but can dictate our tempo.\n\n\\- Nacho left. It still blows my mind on why he didn't pay the extra money for Yoro. Counting on Alaba and Militao to return especially with how insane this season's schedule is was a foolish gamble. And thank god we somehow found Asencio to promote.\n\n\\- Joselu left. Instead of replacing him with literally any no name #9. Didn't need to be Kane or Lewandowski level. Any tall guy who with experience would've worked. Instead they give us a unproven 5\"6 prospect. I can understand, Kane being old, a huge transfer fee would not make sense, but ffs. Sorloth after scoring that quadruple against us, we should've signed him immediately knowing Joselu was leaving. He would've gel with the squad 1000x better.\n\n\\- Carvajal getting old. This one has been a problem since like 2018. Carvajal having no actual backup. We always see the moment he's injured, the team struggled, cause we then had no natural RB. These cracks used to be partially covered by Nacho, but he left too. So now we got stuck with a RW having to play there. No fault of LV, but he's just not a RB. Period.\n\n\\- WE DID NOT NEED MBAPPE. As phenomenal of a talent as he may be, he was NEVER what that team needed, especially after seeing Vinicius progressing so much. What would've been better ? a pacey left footed winger. Yes, we have Guler but the kid has zero pace and is more of a CAM. \n\n  \nLast year, we got dealt the same shit hand after Benzema left. Carlo begged for them to sign Kane. Instead, they gave him Jude. What does he do ? He switches our formation entirely to accommodate for it. Having Jude playing as false 9 due to his eye for goal. People like to say \"It's Jude's individual brilliance in the 1st half of the season...\" As if Jude was a CDM scoring all his goals from 30 yards longshots. Meanwhile, Carlo was the one who set up the tactics to put the lad in those positions in the first place. \n\nLast year, the team even through early injuries from Courtois, Alaba, Militao, we still had balance and variety.  If the front two did not work, sub one out and bring Joselu. Now we have a tall guy to cross to, which made our attacks much more dynamic. \n\nPeople like to remember the 2016-2017 team for being \"stacked\" but the reality is the team was just so balanced and deep. Zidane could literally play 3 diff formations at will with 3 distinct tactics. Not just because he's a top manager but because he had the personnel to do so.\n\n\\- 433 : with KCM and BBC in front\n\n\\- 41212 : with Isco at CAM and Benzema - CR7 up top (sometimes even Morata - CR7)\n\n\\- 442 : with young Asencio and Vazquez at wings cause they can track back more.\n\nUltimately we can put as much blame on Ancelotti as we want, but making him a scapegoat and letting the board get away with their shit squad planning scoot free is so naive. Cause no matter how much some of you will hate to admit it, bring any other of these so called tactical managers here and give him the same hand our board gave Carlo and he's failing too. \n\nPeople are glazing Flick, he already told Laporta he wants Nico Williams, and their board is probably cooking their books as we speak to make the transfer happen. Pep after Rodri got injured, and KDB and some of his CBs, the City board 200M in the winter transfer. Our managers ask for players, get told to fuckoff X-Y-Z galactico we don't even need at that time is coming, deal with it. And when the unbalanced team fails, the only head rolling is the manager's, of course.\n\nAnyways, Carlo is leaving at the end of the season most likely. And even if for some weird reason, he's not sacked or wtv, if the board does not properly address all the gaping holes in this squad, I'd resign, just like Zidane. Cause him too was made to be the fall guy meanwhile every time he requested a transfer they told him to fuck off. People all want Xabi to come, me too. But if the board does not adjust they way they plan their squad, they'll just set him up for failure and sabotage him just like they did with Zidane and Ancelotti.\n\nPeople are worried about Ancelotti, I'm more worried about the broad committing the same sequence of mistakes they made in the 00s when they let Makelele leave in order to bring Beckham cause $$$$. And then proceeded to make every manager the scapegoat by sacking them when in reality it was a team balance issue solely on them.",

But the unfortunate truth is that a lot of this success comes down to individual brillance. Now, before you start saying that it isn\u2019t, we need to make something clear. There is individual brillance in a well organized team with a coach that has a tactic in mind like for example Flick\u2019s Barca and Lamine Yamal and there\u2019s individual brillance in a non cohesive unit, so Ancelotti\u2019s Madrid. If you watch the games every week instead of basing your opinions on rating apps, you will immediately notice that the problem with this Madrid team is that there is no cohesion, we are playing without an identity, a game plan or crucial tactics. I believe that when a team loses, the manager AND the players are at fault, but the manager has a lot of responsibility because he sets up his team in the way that he wants them to play and implements tactics to make his players better. \n\nThe game versus Arsenal demonstrates what a manager with a tactical vision can do against the other that has no idea what is going on anymore. It\u2019s time to actually wake up guys, seriously. We get outplayed by the likes of Sociedad, Espanyol, Betis, a Milan side who lost 3-1 to Liverpool, Dortmund, Valencia at home, Barcelona, Bilbao and even Lille. Has there been a single game against a big team that Real Madrid won this season while looking good? And before you say Dortmund or even Manchester City, no they do not count. Dortmund was a reaction by the players where the individuality came out and Vini managed to score that hattrick and that Manchester City side is a horrendous team who is worse than us so us being slightly better than them was in our favor. The rest, humiliation after humiliation. It\u2019s something that has been happening with Ancelotti\u2019s Madrid but the simple fact that he has been winning titles is enough to blind the eyes of the masses so that people calling themselves Madrid fans will callout other fans ungrateful for wanting the manager to leave when **everyone** who watches the games can see that there\u2019s nothing going on with this team anymore. He changes the formation every time, going from a 4-4-2 to a 4-3-3 to a 4-2-3-1, he refuses to put obvious starters over very average players who show week in and week out that they do not have the level to play for this club anymore and he doesn\u2019t want to play Arda Guler or Bobby in matches where we need creativity and someone willing to press, someone willing to make runs in behind and contribute to the team. Everyone knows that David Alaba and Lucas Vazquez do not have the level to play for this club anymore but Ancelotti still wants to deploy the both of them as his fullbacks? Did he not see the disasterclass of Alaba against Sociedad who was about to score a hattrick of own goals? Did he not realize for the entirety of the season that any winger with a decent amount of dribbling skills can beat Vazquez and that he leaves huge gaps in behind, making it easier for the team to counterattack? It\u2019s been the same thing with Ancelotti since the beginning of this season, he refuses to use simple logic and goes with his reasoning even though it\u2019s obvious that it won\u2019t work. A lot of criticism that Ancelotti gets is deserved and the majority of the time, it\u2019s coming from Madridistas that want this team to succeed but aren\u2019t deluded because their team wins games then and there. We do not play well and that\u2019s undeniable.\n\nBut Ancelotti is not going to be the only point of my critique. Like I said, when a team loses, the players and the manager will be blamed and this team, almost none of them can escape what\u2019s next. Courtois is the only one that I can\u2019t criticize because he has saved this team and Ancelotti so many times that he very much deserves to be called a Real Madrid legend. Lucas Vazquez needs to respect himself and leave this club at the end of the season because he\u2019s a liability in defence. Offensively, he still has his game IQ so he knows when to make a pass, when to make a run or when to cross, but defensively it\u2019s catastrophic. He gets too high on the pitch but can\u2019t run back so it lets the opposition team a lot of space to counter, he can\u2019t mark his man in set pieces and he gets beaten by nearly anyone in a 1v1. When I mean anyone, he was getting beaten by Pachuca\u2019s wingers in the Intercontinental cup final, guys that up to that competition, no one knew about. Out of the 9 goals Barcelona scored against us in the two matches, **five** of them comes from Lucas Vazquez\u2019s side, so clearly even Flick knows that he is our weakest point in defence. R\u00fcdiger this season has been really poor and Alaba at LB is a topic that I will not discuss anymore, Modric is too old to be starting in physically intense matches like these and the Fantastic Four showed once again why it\u2019s not working out. It won\u2019t work out because Ancelotti puts Bellingham as a LWB to help Alaba against Saka, the same thing that he did against Barcelona but on a lesser scale and you can even use the heat maps to justify this point. Vinicius has been in a really poor form recently, Rodrygo is downright non existent and Mbappe is the only one trying to do something right now.\n\nYou can agree or disagree with me, but I stand by what I say. This team needs a new project, a new manager who\u2019ll give the team an identity with a tactical vision and it also needs help from Perez and the board. It\u2019s nice to have stars in one team, but when you refuse to see the truth and think that Madrid will always win in the end even after such poor performances every week, you need to start asking yourselves the good questions. Even if we somehow win against Arsenal, do not be fooled and forget the entire season.",

To rest our players thinking about la remontada but risking the league. Or just cutting our losses in the UCL and focusing on the league and the cup, maybe even rotating in the game on Tuesday... A double local title would be quite good tbh and we just won the UCL and in spite of what this club has accustomed us to, we can't win it every year. But again the UCL is our competition so I want us to go for it. What do you all think ?",

        "content": "I want to start by saying that realistically i think our changes of overturning the result from the first leg are very low based on how the team performed this season, but my heart remembers all the times we were against the odds and we somehow managed to turn things over.\n\nSo what do you think needs to be done in the second leg in order for us to qualify. I\u2019ll start:\n\n1. Fran Garcia needs to start instead of Alaba. This will give us someone that can run and keep up with Saka and also Jude won\u2019t be needed to cover on the defesive end for Alaba on every possession.\n\n2. Rodrygo needs to start on the left and Brahim on the right with Mbappe on the center. I love Vini to death, but right now he\u2019s not what the team needs. Rodrygo\u2019s link up play and the fact that he\u2019s not fixed demonstrating that he is the rightfully Ballon D\u2019Or might be the key to a deadly combination with Mbappe. \n\n3. Honestly i don\u2019t think Arsenal will come on the Bernabeu to defend even though that will be the best way for them to make sure they qualify based on how we struggled to attack low block defenses this season. They want to show the world that they are team that can compete and needs to be respected, and this might be our ace in the sleeve. They showed glimpses of lacking chemistry on the defensive end without Gabriel, so we need to take advantage of those. The main idea that should be in everybody\u2019s mind needs to be \u201cno stupid fouls, no free kicks\u201d, they know this is their strenght so they will look to obtain as many as they can. Force them to shoot or pass sideways. \n\nI want to hear your thoughts on this. ",
