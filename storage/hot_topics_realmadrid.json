        "content": "Vinicius has every right to be upset with Real Madrid fans if they boo him or any other player. However, Vinicius himself must not forget that those whistles did not come because of a single moment or an one mistake, but rather due to a long and repeated period of underperformance.\n\nLast season (2024\u20132025), Real Madrid were leading La Liga by a seven-point margin, only to throw it away. This season, they were once again on top with a five-point lead, which they lost in a short period of time, allowing Barcelona to move ahead by four points. These are things we don't  forget.\n\nVinicius numbers this season also cannot be ignored. He has scored only five goals in 24 matches statistics that are not even acceptable for a mid-table team. In his last 14 matches, he has not scored a single goal and has provided only three assists. In 12 matches, he did not contribute either a goal or an assist. If mid-level teams would not accept such numbers, how can a club that aims to win major titles like La Liga and the UEFA Champions League accept them?\n\nVinicius reaction was not limited to showing frustration or expressing discomfort. He went further by changing his profile picture and replacing his Real Madrid image with one of himself representing Brazil. At that point, the issue shifted from a conflict with the fans to a problem with the club\u2019s management.\n\nNow the Real Madrid board must ask itself: what exactly should Vinicius be forgiven for?\n\nFor his recurring issues with the coach?\n\nFor embarrassing the club on the biggest moment during El Cl\u00e1sico, portraying Real Madrid as a team lacking discipline and an administration unable to control its players?\n\nFor demanding the highest contract in the club\u2019s history?\nOr for his unconvincing performances on the pitch?\n\nVinicius has exhausted his credit with everyone. If he does not take responsibility, reassess himself, and significantly improve his performances at the beginning of next year, the situation may go beyond the end of his career at Real Madrid. He could find himself unwanted even by Europe\u2019s biggest clubs.",

That was pretty embarssing\n\nMan Utd is a perfect example of a top club facing downfall, they dominated in 90s, 20s and even early 2010s, but since fergie their downfall started and it's not stopping anytime soon\n\nReal Madrid are a top club and always have stayed there, I just wanted to know that when did real Madrid faced their worst downfall?

        "content": "Don't get me wrong, I love the Hala Madrid decima anthem. It works incredibly as the goal song, and I loved hearing it during the pre-game walkouts. But there is something about Jose de Aguilar's version that keeps me listening to it over and over again.\n\n\"Hala Madrid, Hala Madrid  \nNoble y b\u00e9lico adalid, caballero del honor  \nHala Madrid, Hala Madrid  \nA triunfar en buena lid, defendiendo tu color  \nHala Madrid, Hala Madrid, Hala Madrid\"\n\nWhy did they stop using this after the final whistle? It gets really repetitive hearing the modern anthem play before and after games and even as the goal song. I pray they bring it back one day.",

He is Tier 2 mainly because of his closeness with Florentino Perez.\n\nMost voted comments:\n\n**\u00d3scar P\u00e9rez:** Vini is a good player. Fast, good in one-on-one situations... but in his position, the best is Mbapp\u00e9, and Vini doesn't accept that. Mbapp\u00e9 has been able to adapt to his position and continue performing at a high level, while Vini does whatever he feels like at any given moment. They say it's easier to get rid of one player than twenty-five... so maybe it's time to transfer Vini and address the team's needs.\n\n**Luis Serra:** When you indulge a child's every whim, overprotect them, always portray them as a victim, and never call them out on their bad behavior, they grow up to be an irresponsible, completely self-centered, arrogant, and conceited person, utterly lacking in self-awareness. The entire Real Madrid community\u2014the club, the fans, and the paid media\u2014you have created a monster that is now devouring you. Enjoy it.\n\n**Oscar Fernandez:** Whitewashing by Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix, after a call from Uncle Floren. You forgot to write that it's all, all, all Xabi Alonso's fault.",
