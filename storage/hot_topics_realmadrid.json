All the happiness, all the emotions, we owe a lot of it to him.\nEven when things were bad, Carlo gave us calm. He never disrespected the club, never created drama, never lost his class. He always carried himself with dignity and love for this badge.\nNot every season can end with a trophy, but it is the memories and the journey that stay forever.\nIt hurts to say goodbye but he deserves this next chapter with Brazil.\nThank you Mister for everything you gave us.

        "content": "Lately, I can't help but feel a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as a Madridista. The 2024/25 season is starting to mirror the events of the 2014/15 campaign in some uncanny ways.\n\nBack in 2014, under Carlo, we started the season on a high, winning both the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup. Expectations were massive. But as the season went on, things began to slip. We fell short in La Liga, got knocked out in the Copa del Rey, and exited the Champions League in the semi-finals. To make matters worse, Barcelona capitalized on our decline and went on to win the treble.\n\nCarlo was sacked at the end of that season. He was replaced by former player Rafa Ben\u00edtez, but that experiment didn\u2019t last long. By mid-season, Ben\u00edtez was gone, and another ex-player stepped up: Zinedine Zidane, who went on to carry us from chaos to glory.  \n\nNow, fast forward to this season. Once again, we started strong by winning the UEFA Super Cup, and we have CWC to play. But despite the solid start, there\u2019s an unsettling sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, key injuries piling up, dropped points at crucial moments, and doubts creeping in just when we need momentum the most. Meanwhile, Barcelona are finding their rhythm and are in the mix for a potential treble once again (HOPEFULLY FUCKING NOT).\n\nTo top it off, Carlo is set to depart, not by sacking this time, but via mutual agreement and with another former player likely stepping in to take the reins. The parallels are undeniable.\n\nMaybe it's fate. Maybe it's the end of a cycle. But just like last time, I believe this could be the foundation for something even greater. After all, what followed 2015 was the beginning of one of the most dominant eras in Champions League history.\n\nLet\u2019s hope we\u2019re about to witness another rebirth. What's your thoughts guys?",

        "title": "If the board doesn't want to spend too much money on defenders, why don't they look at cheaper alternatives?",
        "content": "I get that breaking the bank for guys like Saliba, Bastoni, Nuno Mendes etc. might not be possible, we don't have unlimited funds and real life isn't FIFA career mode. But why don't we aim on buying some guys from lower La Liga sides? There are some very decent defensive teams out there, plus these players have experience in Spain. Our rivals do it all the time:\n\n* Barcelona's starting defense all season consists of Kounde (bought from Sevilla for 50m), Cubarsi (academy), Inigo Martinez (free agent from Bilbao) and Balde (academy). Their back-up options like Araujo, Fort or Gerrard Martin (their LB in the final) are also from the B team/academy, while the only players they bought as seniors from abroad were Eric Garcia and Christensen, both for free (and they barely play anyway this season).\n* Atletico also have their fair share of defenders from other La Liga teams. Lenglet is on loan from Barcelona, Le Normand was bought for 32m from Real Sociedad, Javi Galan was bought from Celta for 5m, Llorente was bought for 30m from us and the rest are free or extremely cheap transfers from abroad like Azpi, Witsel, Gimenez, Reinildo etc.\n\nI'm not saying any of that to \"glaze\" those teams, it would just be a good strategy for us to follow. Excluding Kounde for 50m (even that feels like a steal nowadays), we could get some pretty decent defenders like Zubeldia, Mosquera, Vivian, Foyth (if he's fully fit), Ratiu, Elustondo, Alderete etc. We can get (most of) these guys **for 35m or way lower than that.** Also our very own Miguel. The last time we bought someone in any position from La Liga teams, that wasn't our ex-player, was Odriozola in 2018.\n\nYeah, these options aren't \"amazing\", but I'd take them over the majority of our current defenders in a heartbeat. Like it or not, Alaba and Militao are pretty much done at this level of football, Rudiger has been playing semi-injured for months now and we don't know how this is gonna affect his future, Mendy is extremely injury prone and inconsistent and Carvajal is also a huge question mark. We can't afford to go into yet another season with midfielders covering 2 or 3 defensive positions per game, we're Real Madrid, not some amateur high school team.\n\nIt's also no coincidence that some of our most iconic defenders have been either academy graduates (Carvajal, Nacho) or bought from La Liga teams (Ramos, Salgado). Plus Castilla graduate Hakimi is a top 3 RB in the world now. I believe that our academy can have more \"Asencios\" out there, don't forget that Joan was much more hyped than him at the start of last season. If we don't wanna invest ANY money, might as well give those kids a chance. Giving endless chances to underperforming Alaba/Militao etc. will only result in another Vazquez 24/25 situation, at least the kids can always improve.\n\nAnother option is looking at defenders from teams who are missing out on UCL/European football, so they'll be very tempted by our offer, that's why I mentioned both CBs from La Real before. Pavlovic from Milan looked promising when I watched them in the UCL. Theo also apparently can be sold for 30m, that's the steal of the century. Leipzig and Dortmund fall under that category (Schlotterbeck is a favorite of mine, although he's gonna cost 50m+). Speaking of Bundesliga, ex Castilla CB Lienhart has been quite good for a while now and his team are currently in a UCL spot.\n\nFinally, when it comes to potential free agents, the most interesting option (excluding Trent) is Tah from Leverkusen.\n\nSurely some of these options could be taken into consideration, not every transfer has to be \"sign the best in the world or no one\".",

        "content": "\n\nWho would you rather have as our next coach: Klopp or Xabi?\n\nWith Ancelotti probably leaving after next season, the big question is who takes over. Two names keep popping up: J\u00fcrgen Klopp and Xabi Alonso. Both are exciting in their own way, but they\u2019d take the club in very different directions.\n\nKlopp is a proven winner, brought titles to both Dortmund and Liverpool, and knows how to build a strong, united team. His high-pressing style and passion could be a nice shake-up at Madrid. But... would his system and personality fit here? And would he get the time he usually needs to build?\n\nThen there's Xabi\u2014club legend, absolute baller back in the day, and now doing wonders at Leverkusen. He\u2019s young in coaching terms, but already looks like a top tactician. He understands the club, the culture, and could bring that identity back. But is it too soon for him? Would the pressure at Madrid be too much this early in his career?\n\nSo what do you guys think? Would you go for the experience and fire of Klopp, or the familiarity and potential of Xabi?\n\nPersonally, I'm torn\u2014Klopp would be a huge statement, but seeing Xabi on the sidelines at the Bernab\u00e9u just feels right.\n\nCurious to hear what everyone thinks!\n\n",
