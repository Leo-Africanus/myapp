        "content": "#FT: JUVENIL A 1:2 VALENCIA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#COPA DE CAMPEONES\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:**\n\n0:1 Aimar Bl\u00e1zquez (p) 55'\n\n1:1 Jaime Barroso (p) 84'\n\n1:2 David Otorbi 90'+5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - kickoff, vamos! \n\n16' - Fortea is through on goal after a long ball, gets pulled to the floor with force by the Valencia player, red card, yellow at the minimum, the referee doesn't even give a foul however... \n\n40' - Our boys are pushing hard for the opener now, the Valencia keeper can first save a rebound by Pitarch after a cross from the left, then he makes a good save on a shot from distance by Roberto Mart\u00edn\n\n44' - Y\u00e1\u00f1ez shot from the edge of the box is saved easily by the Valencia keeper, then moments later, on the other side of the pitch, Javi Navarro can save a one on one with the Valencia attacker to prevent their lead\n\nHT - 0:0 after an even first half with both teams having had chances to potentially take the lead. Juvenil A started gaining more control as the half went on, and Valencia could or should've already received a red card \n\n46' - 2nd half underway\n\n49' - biggest chance for Juvenil A so far after Cestero puts through Y\u00e1\u00f1ez, but the goalkeeper makes a great save to deny his shot into the bottom left corner\n\n53' - penalty for Valencia, Liberto was holding on to the Valencia players shirt, but another Valencia player had already shot the ball way out of bounds - another very controversial call... \n\n\u26bd 55' - Bl\u00e1zquez steps up and converts... \n\n\ud83d\udd04 58' - Barroso for Rivera \n\n60' - the team has been extremely dominant in this second half so far, with multiple situations of chaos in Valencias box, where our boys missed the chance to finish the situation off\n\n\ud83d\udd04 80' - Pol Dur\u00e1n for Liberto \n\n83' - penalty for Juvenil A after Cestero is pulled in the box - unlike the penalty Valencia got, the cross was actually headed for our player\n\n\u26bd 84' - GOLLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - Barroso converts! \n\n\u26bd 90'+5 - Otorbi scores for Valencia - how can you defend like that in added time? Fortea is nowhere to be seen as Valencia attack over the left side - Lamini can clear, but the ball gets cleared out to the left again - Lezcano has to step out because Fortea is still gone, the cross comes in, Navarro can't catch it and Aguado is left against two opponents at the far post, where Otorbi nods it into the net\n\nFT - Arbeloa's career as Juvenil A's coach ends with the textbook template of the Juvenil A matches of the past years, superior, dominant, countless opportunities to win the match, and in the end we get scored on with their first chance in the entire half due  to laziness and naivety tracking back - Valencia go to the final against Betis or Deportivo, and all in all, it was a pretty disappointing season for Juvenil A \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 20:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Municipal de Toral\u00edn, Ponferrada\n\n**Referee:** Alexandre L\u00f3pez Vila\n\n**Competition:** Copa de Campeones, Final Four, Semi-Final\n\n**Viewing options:** [YouTube RFEF](https://www.youtube.com/live/I-5RxqVfWAs?si=xSflicQju-Rq20bh), [RMTV/RM PLAY](https://play.realmadrid.com/home)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Juvenil A XI (4-3-3):** Javi Navarro - Diego Aguado, Lamini Fati, \u00c1lvaro Lezcano, Jes\u00fas Fortea - Jorge Cestero, Thiago Pitarch, Roberto Mart\u00edn - Liberto Navascu\u00e9s (80' Pol Dur\u00e1n), Pol Rivera (58' Jaime Barroso), Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez\n\nBench: \u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez (GK), Diego Arroyo (GK), Roi Torres, \u00d3scar Mesa, Mario Rivas, Izan Regueira, Marco Company, Pablo Montero, Aimar Santiago. \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n",

        "content": "o, there has been a bit of debate in the sub about the necessity of Stiller.\n\nWithout entering into the need for a midfielder or not (and I believe we definitely need one to go into the season calm and assured that injuries cannot derail our season), this is a good image of the qualities Angelo Stiller displays.\n\nHere are all the European under-24 midfielders, and you can check his numbers in winning duels % and successful progressive passes.\n\nAs you can see, he is elite in both categories at the same time. You can see in the photo Pedri, Camavinga, Marc Casado, and also, if you are interested, see the big lie that Gavi is.\n\nAnother player I like is Adrian Bernabe, but Stiller is much better.\n\nHere, we cannot see the comparison with Tchouameni because he is over 24, but I think this is a good display of why this player caught the eye of Alonso and Real Madrid.\n\nThe guy is elite at bringing the ball forward, and that will help us to quickly bypass the high press of Arsenal and Bar\u00e7a, bringing the ball to Vini and Mbapp\u00e9 in an advantageous position.\n\nThis guy, together with Trent, is exactly the piece we need to break those teams' high pressure that was so difficult to handle this year.",

But it feels like we already have a similar profile in the team, and many of us agree that another season at Como might be the best move for his growth.\n\nThat said, with Bellingham set to miss around three months due to shoulder surgery, Nico could be a perfect solution to fill that role, but then what? \nReports from Spain suggest he\u2019s not coming back just to sit on the bench, if he returns it\u2019s to compete for real minutes, which is exactly why he left in the first place.\n\nNow personally, I\u2019d still love to see us bring in Angelo Stiller to add more control and creativity in midfield, like Kroos used to provide. Or who knows, maybe Alonso will find his flow without that. \nBut let\u2019s be honest, we\u2019re already overloaded in that position and Ceballos probably needs to go.\n\nAll this midfield talk is stressing me out, not gonna lie, I want them all in the squad.\n\nWhat do you all think?\n\u2022 Is it worth bringing Nico back for the Club World Cup and the start of the season?\n\u2022 Do you see him getting meaningful minutes?\n\u2022 Could he even jump ahead of G\u00fcler in the pecking order?\n",

        "content": "Hey guys, today I\u2019ve got a question for you:\nWhat\u2019s your opinion on the Club World Cup?\nDo you think it\u2019s an important tournament, or is it just something minor that doesn\u2019t really matter?\n\nHonestly, for me\u2014at least for now\u2014I still think the Champions League is the most important competition of the season. I\u2019m just used to seeing the biggest tournaments as the ones with the best European teams.\n\nMaybe the Club World Cup doesn\u2019t feel that big to me because there are a lot of teams I\u2019ve never heard of. But let\u2019s be fair\u2014these teams are supposed to be the best from their respective confederations, so they earned their spot in the tournament.\n\nSo why am I even making this question?\n\nWell, over the past few days, I\u2019ve seen a lot of Spanish journalists\u2014yeah, actual journalists from the biggest media outlets in Spain\u2014mocking and belittling the Club World Cup\u2026 just because Barcelona isn\u2019t in it.\n\nThese people try to act like they\u2019re neutral, but if you follow their careers, it\u2019s obvious their favorite club\u2014or at least the one paying them\u2014is Barcelona.\nThey\u2019re saying things like:\n\u201cThe Club World Cup is less important than the Copa del Rey,\u201d\n\u201cHow can a serious tournament include Seattle Sounders?\u201d\n\u201cThree champions from the top leagues aren\u2019t even going,\u201d\nand \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if Liverpool and Barcelona aren\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nThey even say that Madrid fans only care about this tournament because it\u2019s the only thing Madrid can win this season\u2014which is just not true. Since the beginning of the season, the club has made it clear that they want to be the first team to win this new version of the tournament.\nThat\u2019s just how it is with Madrid\u2014when there\u2019s a trophy to win, the goal is to go for it. Always.\n\nAnd the thing is, these are the same journalists who\u2019ve been shaping football narratives in Spain for over 20 years. So it\u2019s really no surprise there\u2019s so much hate toward Real Madrid in the country.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget\u2014Barcelona is currently in the middle of a legal case where it was proven they paid journalists to speak positively about the club and its president, and negatively about others, including Messi. If you want to know more, just search \u201cBar\u00e7aGate\u201d on Google.\n\nAnd when it comes to the Negreira case, many of these journalists have never even brought it up on their own. When they\u2019re forced to talk about it, they say stuff like, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d but then go on to say, \u201cBarcelona never won because of the referees.\u201d\nMeanwhile, they make videos asking how it\u2019s possible that Madrid hasn\u2019t won back-to-back league titles in nearly 20 years.\nHonestly, Spanish football journalism is just embarrassing.\n\nAnyway, I really want to hear what you guys think.\nIs the Club World Cup something important to you? Or not really?\n\n",
