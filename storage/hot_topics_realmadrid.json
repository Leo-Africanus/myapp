The team is missing KROOS for fuck sakes are we all going to ignore that? Yea I know his strategies has not been working this season even I am frustrated with him, but we have such huge egos to handle and there aren't many who can do that. Remember what happened to man United after sir Alex left. Respect carlo he has given us enough for him to decide when to leave.",

        "title": "The referee: a disgrace",
        "content": "In the last night's match vs La Real at the Bernabeu, Vini among others were subjected to so much shit from the opposition players. The ref missed (read: purposefully ignored) a clear penalty call, a clear foul on the edge of the box, and what can only be described as a criminal tackle, which would earn a real madrid player an 8-match suspension if the shoe was on the other foot (pun intended). All of these \"50-50\" calls went against us and the clearly bought ref did not consult VAR for any of them (la copa has VAR from R16 on). Shitshows like these keep repeating from the Spanish refs. Except for the occasional decision unfairly benefiting us, we can easily put up a montage that will prove my point. \n\nTwo things come to mind as a reaction:\n\n1. After the red card worthy challenge last night, the 40yo smallest-guy-on-the-pitch Modric gave a body check to a sociadad player. No one else on our team had any such reaction after the numerous fouls against us (their 23 to our 6 btw, check the stats). You can go back and count the number of times Vini was poked from behind. That made me think if Ramos, Pepe, or Casemiro were on the team, no team would have dared to pull this shit against us. Remember the Casemiro tackle on Milner in front of the Liverpool bench, which earned a smile from Zidane? In contrast, Ancelotti is too passive in these matters and the most he pulls is a sarcastic smile when a decision goes against us (I know Don Carlo is cool but maybe too cool for our welfare). I think this attitude definitely seeps into the players and they let things go a lot. We need someone to step up as the enforcer: maybe Rudi maybe Fede maybe Tchoua? Even Eder (rip) used to protect Vini some time ago :'). This is one of the reasons why I would accept letting Ancelotti move on at the end of the season even if we win silverware. I don't know how Xabi is when it comes to these things but I can imagine anyone would be more balanced than Carlo.\n\n2. This one is a bit out there. In the shitstorm that is Spanish refereeing and criminal challenges from defenders of other Spanish teams (I'm looking at you Mallorca and Maffeo), Real Madrid are on the right side of history currently. We have the least fouls committed and yellow cards earned in la liga (red cards too if not for Bellingham :') and Vini). We have especially cleaned our act after the horror Diakhaby injury last season. We focus on getting back at the opposition not by retaliating physically, but by beating them (Mallorca supercopa semis), which is how gentlemen do it. We generally don't pull time-wasting shit, less than the opposition anyway. And I've never seen Real Madrid near the corner flag just running down the clock. We generally don't play a low block and are pretty industrious if you look at it, albeit out of ideas at times. All of this could be because Real Madrid is truly royal (and la liga doesn't deserve us btw) or it could be on Perez's instructions. Avoid all heat till the ESL thing calms down. Also, let's be honest, even we probably bribed referees in the past, come on. If we are to target referees, we cannot give them any fuel. Fair. That doesn't mean all this shit doesn't give me acidity though.",
