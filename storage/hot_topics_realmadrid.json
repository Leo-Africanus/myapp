Over the years we\u2019ve hosted watch parties, sent members to matches, partner with brands - the sort of things a Pe\u00f1a is supposed to do. We\u2019ve gone through the requirements on the official site and we\u2019re confident we meet all of them.\n\nThe issue is with actually getting a reply from the club. Every time we email the Department of Pe\u00f1as, we get one rather hasty reply asking for some info...and that's about it. No follow-up, no progress, fully ghosted. We\u2019ve tried different contact addresses, provided all the details and evidence they could possibly need \u2014 same story every time. It\u2019s been like this for almost three years now.\n\nSo, to those of you who\u2019ve successfully gotten your Pe\u00f1a officially recognized \u2014 is there another way around this, or someone specific we should reach out to? Any insight at all would be super appreciated.\n",

        "title": "Arda G\u00fcler is becoming a scapegoat for Madrid\u2019s imbalance",
        "content": "I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about this \u2014 and honestly, it frustrates me how Arda G\u00fcler is slowly becoming the scapegoat for something that\u2019s not even his fault. It\u2019s not about him being lazy or not ready \u2014 it\u2019s about the structural imbalance in the squad and how he\u2019s being forced into a role that doesn\u2019t suit him at all.\n\nRight now, the three midfielders we\u2019re using are Jude Bellingham, Arda G\u00fcler, and Tchouam\u00e9ni.\nAnd here\u2019s the root of the problem \u2014 Tchouam\u00e9ni, for all his defensive strength and ball-winning ability, just cannot progress the ball on his own. He struggles to receive it with his back to goal, turn, and move it forward under pressure. That\u2019s not his game. And that\u2019s fine \u2014 but if that\u2019s your holding midfielder, then you need someone beside him who can do it.\n\nNow, Jude can do that. Jude can receive the ball under pressure, shield it, turn, and drive forward. But we can\u2019t use Jude there right now \u2014 because we need him higher up the pitch. Why?\nBecause Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 will never be that constant box presence. He\u2019ll drift wide, link up, drop deep, but he won\u2019t live inside the box. So someone has to attack that space. That\u2019s where Jude comes in \u2014 he\u2019s the one crashing the box, timing those runs, giving us presence inside the area.\n\nAnd that leaves Arda G\u00fcler having to do a job he\u2019s not built for \u2014 dropping deep, receiving with his back to goal, and progressing the ball. That\u2019s not his natural role.\nHe\u2019s a number 10. He\u2019s a creative player. He wants to face the goal, not play with his back to it. He\u2019s effective when he\u2019s closer to the final third, linking up and making decisive passes \u2014 not when he\u2019s asked to act like a deep-lying playmaker or tempo controller.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying Arda G\u00fcler is incapable of doing that job. I genuinely believe he can develop into that role in a year or two \u2014 he\u2019s got the technical ability, the intelligence, and the mindset. But right now, he\u2019s more of a natural number 10 than a deep-lying playmaker. If he\u2019s forced to do that role too early, mistakes will happen \u2014 and they already have. But that\u2019s part of development.\nWe can\u2019t crucify him for it. He\u2019s still young, still learning, and these are the experiences that shape a player. If we start tearing into him mentally at this stage, it could affect his confidence and his growth. He\u2019s just a kid \u2014 anything can happen if the pressure becomes too much. That\u2019s why I feel so strongly that it shouldn\u2019t be Arda we\u2019re blaming \u2014 it should be the squad planning and the coach\u2019s tactical choices.\n\nAgainst smaller La Liga sides, sure, it works \u2014 they don\u2019t press as aggressively, and his technical ability carries him through. But in big games, against physical teams and hostile atmospheres, it\u2019s brutal. He\u2019s being exposed in a role that doesn\u2019t suit him yet.\n\nThe real issue is still Tchouam\u00e9ni\u2019s limitation as a complete CDM.\nIf we had someone like Zubimendi instead, the whole structure would make more sense. Zubimendi can progress the ball, he can receive under pressure, and he\u2019s calm and composed in tight spaces. With a player like that, Jude could stay higher where he\u2019s most effective, and Arda could operate closer to the final third, not stuck in the engine room.\n\nRight now, the team is being held together by compromises \u2014 Jude\u2019s being pushed higher to fix the lack of striker presence, and Arda\u2019s being pushed deeper to compensate for what Tchouam\u00e9ni can\u2019t do. It\u2019s all backwards.\n\nSo when people start pointing fingers at Arda, I just can\u2019t agree.\nHe\u2019s not the reason for Madrid\u2019s imbalance \u2014 he\u2019s just the one suffering the consequences of poor squad planning and mismatched roles.\n\nAnd unless that changes, we\u2019ll keep seeing talented youngsters being blamed for problems they didn\u2019t create.\n",

He had left that position far behind before even coming to Madrid. Even at the 2020 Euros, when France had literally Benzema as a striker, they were still playing 3-4-1-2, with both Benzema and Mbappe as CF\n\nIt can also be seen that he has had better stats as CF too.\n\nCompare that to Vini, who won the best player in the world award(FIFA the Best) and came second in Ballon d'Or, being one of the main reason Real Madrid had their most succesful season since the 1960's, as a LEFT WINGER.\n\n  \nVini was straight up the best winger in football, for at least 3 years. Even now he has more G/A than any other winger in the world, except for Bayern's\n\n",
