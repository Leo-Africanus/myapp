        "content": "Hear me out first , our fanbase is one of the agressive ones where we demand results nonmatter what. If a manager or players doesn't live up to the expectations then he would be criticised by fans. Mbappe is exactly that because the hype around him is enormous and it's been there for us since 2021 when there were initial rumours. Now mbappe's problem is the adaptability here because PSG worked around him but RMA won't (we still aren't benching him tho). Mbappe needs to find his essence here.\n\nNow why I believe in mbappe is because I used to see fucking PSG's match due to this guy. It was so fun to watch him although there were so many problems in that team and then came 2020 UCL run and eventually worldcup. He has shown his potential and certainly a big game player. \n\nMbappe right now is something that he tries hard to do something , make something out of the chances (hits the goalkeeper lol) , he is trying to be on the ball but I feel he isn't using his real strength of getting behind , la liga's and Ligue un difference is huge. Fellow players and Ancelotti will play a major role and especially Ancelotti because he have to teach him rather than following mbappe that he'll do something. I feel so frustrated while watching the matches because I used to think that our midlfielf + mbappe would be something out of this world yet here we are struggling without kroos \ud83d\ude2d\n\nAlso the problem isn't mbappe solely , our structure is the problem because there isn't one most of the times and we need to improve. It took longer than this to players to adapt and once our team starts clicking , we will be unbeatable \ud83d\ude0c",

        "content": "Two days ago, ESPN's Graham Hunter released an article about Real Madrid's injury issues. In there, he notes that Paul Burgess walked away from Madrid because of concerns over the focus on the pitch. This was the first I heard of it and thought I just missed it. But then when I tried to search for more details on it, I could not find anything else online about it. This seems like a MASSIVE story to just be passed by.   \n  \nHere is what Graham Hunter said, \"Right in the middle of renovating their modern and impressive football edifice, Madrid were warned by then-head of pitch maintenance, Paul Burgess, that they had lost focus on how important that part of the project was. He walked away from the club, convinced that it was sewing the seeds of future problems in how they move and store the pitch underground.\"\n\nAnyone else believe this an extremely underplayed story?",

        "content": "Hi all, Manchester United fan here,\n\nAs someone who grew up watching CR7 transform into a force of nature in England, and watched his exploits at Real Madrid, I would like to bust the ridiculous misconception, which has been recently cooked up for some reason, that his start was relatively slow, akin to Mbappe's start right now, [which a post from a few days earlier on here seemed to imply](https://www.reddit.com/r/realmadrid/comments/1gn651a/ronaldo_v_mbappe_after_their_first_10_la_liga/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button). The truth could not be any further from that misconception. To add, CR7 at that point of the season had only scored one penalty, compared to Mbappe having already scored 3 so far, all in La Liga.\n\n[CR7's first 10 La Liga games](https://preview.redd.it/u6jpszbgoo0e1.jpg?width=657&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=918419d1a3a2be13696b366daffd724da2ee14cc)\n\n[Mbappe's first 10 La Liga matches](https://preview.redd.it/5kyiyczvno0e1.jpg?width=646&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6900ea1603b2182555cbd2c14b3059384ea6e6f7)\n\n[CR7's first 4 CL games](https://preview.redd.it/yl4gleoroo0e1.jpg?width=651&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb20374fde3b5a8d732d128e4f0d1ef49ec7d5ae)\n\n[Mbappe's first 4 CL games](https://preview.redd.it/21fvj50uoo0e1.jpg?width=656&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c17e04328461d00076ef19b8bf436c3502efdb0c)\n\nAs shown above, CR7's start was miles better than Mbappe's in reality, what really slowed him down was that ankle injury. In term of individual match performance it's nowhere near close either, CR7 terrorised the defences with the superb dribbling he once possessed and was no slouch creatively either. He joined a Real Madrid side that was a mix of old players and young talents, whereas Mbappe joined a league-winning and CL-winning RM side, though admittedly the midfield has a Kroos-sized hole and the defence is riddled with terrible injury problems this season. Finally, CR7 did much more defensively too, completing 0.4 tackles and 0.4 interceptions in the league, compared to Mbappe completed only 0.1 tackles a game and NO interceptions (as per WhoScored).\n\nDon't get me wrong, Mbappe is a great player and undoubtedly a superb talent, who is severely off-form, but comparing him to CR7 is downright silly.\n\nHope this all helps!",
