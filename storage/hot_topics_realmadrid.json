        "content": "Firstly im no manager, xabi understands better what really is going on, but im noticing fede and tchua are incompaptible with each other in 4-2-3-1. In this double pivot system, whenever 1 performs, the other looks a bit lost. Fede looked great with players like Cebbalos on the pitch tho. Which is why many of our losses or underwhelming performances agaisnt athleti, marseille, sociedad have come from 4-2-3-1. We havent been able to handle ball distribution or create/convert chances in this system. The best ive seen them play as a team was in a 3-4-2-1 against levante, but thats the only game. Would be great if we try that tactic more, cause thats xabi's orignal tactic with leverkusen and would be perfect when our rbs are injured rn.  ",

Round of 16 vs. PSG: Down 1-0 from the first leg and 2-0 on aggregate early in the second, the tie seemed over. Then, Karim Benzema ignited the Bernab\u00e9u. He scored a stunning second-half hat-trick in 17 minutes to flip the script for a 3-2 aggregate win, eliminating Messi, Mbapp\u00e9, and Neymar.\u00a0 \n\u2022 Quarter-Finals vs. Chelsea: Following a Benzema hat-trick in a 3-1 first-leg win at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea fought back to lead 3-0 at the Bernab\u00e9u (4-3 aggregate). With time running out, Luka Modri\u0107 delivered an impossible, outside-of-the-boot assist for Rodrygo to make it 3-1, forcing extra time. Unsurprisingly, Benzema found the winner in extra time (5-4 agg.).\u00a0 \n\u2022 Semi-Finals vs. Man City: A seven-goal thriller saw Real Madrid lose 4-3 in the first leg. In the Bernab\u00e9u return, Riyad Mahrez's 73rd-minute goal made it 5-3 on aggregate, leaving Madrid needing two goals in under 17 minutes. Enter Rodrygo again. He scored in the 90th minute, and then a sublime header in the 91st minute\u2014two goals in 89 seconds\u2014to force extra time. A calm Benzema penalty sealed the impossible 6-5 aggregate victory.

        "content": "I'm an Inter fan and I'm seeing Luka Modric playing 90 minutes against Napoli making his usual genial performance.  \nOfc I've always loved his play-style, his capacity to control the game just like a true Maestro, his long-rage passes (often with trivela) which sent the attackers to goal and many other things and when I saw Madrid was getting rid of him I was truly shocked: he still could have been a super-sub for Madrid, a Maestro who can break the game with a champion's play and the fact he went to AC Milan pissed me so much because I already knew he wasn't gonna play just 10 mins per match.\n\nAnd I was right, he plays all matches as a starter, he plays more than 70 minutes and in the big match, as I said, he played a full-match. He's shining like he's a 25 y/o player in his prime (obviously he's different because he's 40 and he can't really run as fast as before).  \nWith all this stuff said I'm asking you: why did Madrid let him go? Did they think he was washed? How has he really played last year? Thanks.",

On one hand, it\u2019s wild to hear a global pop superstar reference the most legendary football club ever. On the other, I\u2019m honestly not sure what the real significance of this unexpected crossover even is. What do y\u2019all think?",

        "content": "The more I look back, the more I think Gonzalo Higua\u00edn was underrated during his time here. In 264 games for Madrid, he scored 121 goals and added 56 assists. That is a goal contribution every 1.5 games which is elite considering he was often rotating with Benzema and playing in the shadow of Ronaldo.\n\nHe had three 20 plus goal seasons in La Liga and hit double digits in six straight league campaigns, but somehow he is rarely mentioned when people talk about our best strikers of the 2000s.\n\nYes, he had some high profile misses in big games, but consistency over years in a squad full of superstars is not easy. Do you think he was genuinely underappreciated by fans and the club?",

        "title": "How good the team will become if the midfielders improve their creativity in their plays?",
        "content": "Arda Guler is right now the best creative player for Real Madrid. No doubt about it. Other than him, there's not much creativity from other midfielders and I believe they are taking their time to adapt to the new system. I also think that Ceballos still has potential to create good number of chances if he was given a chance to start. Regarding Bellingham, I too believe that he is just a player who leads attacks and good finishing if he gets chances but lacking when it comes to chance creation although he'll be unstoppable if he surprises us. Tchouameni has become good at pressing in the defensive midfield and I think he doesn't have to involve in chance creation.\n\nApart from these 4, there is Camavinga, Brahim Diaz, Valverde who still needs time to establish themselves. I strongly believe they'll definitely bounce back as they're all really good players. So if all of the Real Madrid's midfielders hit their best form this season, how good this team can get? How each midfielder can effectively be utilised? What are your opinions on this?",
