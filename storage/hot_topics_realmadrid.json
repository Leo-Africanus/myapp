Today in midfield line, we have Guler, Bellingham, Valverde, Tchouameni. If Xabi Alonso doesn't want to give up any of these four in the starting XI, Guler or Valverde could play at RW. However, it seems like Guler is meant to play as a deep playmaker by the coach when Bellingham arrives. That's why I feel like Valverde will start playing as a RW in lots of games. What do you think?",

Not only does Xabi value him and think he is important, but Ancelotti also thought the same. He has been a constant in the game for so long, being basically a guaranteed starter so far. He is good at tackling, cutting plays, and just being physical in the game. I feel like he is not talked about enough and even underrated by other fan based. He is not the best in his position, but he is still a good player. I think he is underrated because of his lack of passing skills and game creation. Physical players are not usually the most appreciated, but if he becomes a decent passer then he would probably be one of the best. ",
