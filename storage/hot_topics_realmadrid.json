        "content": "I saw the reports saying the board and players are \"surprised and disappointed\" by the whistles today. Honestly, it\u2019s hilarious. They are surprised by the whistles, but were they surprised when they forced a generational coach like Xabi Alonso out?\n\nPeople love to call international fans \"glory hunters,\" but I\u2019m here in Asia region waking up at 2:00 AM every single week to watch this mess. I don\u2019t watch for the \"glory\" of the past, I watch because I love this club. But right now, the club doesn\u2019t feel like it loves the fans back.\n\nHere is the reality the board needs to hear:\n\n\u2022 No Player is Above the Club: We watched a group of players create a mess, undermine a world-class coach, and ultimately get him sacked. Instead of holding the players accountable, the board backed them and is now trying to \"discipline\" the fans for reacting.\n\n\u2022 The \"Whistle\" is our Voice: If the board thinks they can use security cameras to monitor the Grada and stop the booing, they\u2019ve lost the plot. The Bernab\u00e9u whistles because we demand excellence. If you don't want to be whistled, show the effort on the pitch.\n\n\u2022 We are willing to suffer, but not like this: Every club has bad seasons. We can handle losing if the team fights. What we can\u2019t handle is a board that protects \"untouchable\" stars while threatening the fans who actually pay (and wake up at 2 AM) to support them.\n\nStop being \"disappointed\" in the stands and start being disappointed in the locker room. The badge comes first. Always.",

        "content": "Obviously right now we don't have good dressing room leadership. I think Courtois is the one to lead the team.\n\nI am not sure why Valverde and Vini are the 2nd/3rd captain rather than him, they both made their first appearance as sub in 18-19, especially Valverde's breakthrough year was 19-20. Courtois was rotating with Navas in 18-19 but started more games than both.\n\nCourtois is super solid and got the guts to encourage/yell at the team. Nor do we see him having beef with any RM coaches. I have been big fan of him since his ATM years, you can rewatch the 13-14 final, he made many good saves and forced a 92:48 miracle.",

        "content": "&gt; For me, as Real Madrid coach, it's very clear. I'm going to work to get the best out of Vinicius. I'm going to demand that my players look for him. He's fearless, he has character, he's defended this club tooth and nail, he's one of the most unpredictable players in the world, if not the most unpredictable. He embodies what a Real Madrid player should be. What this player has achieved as a youngster at Real Madrid is something few have accomplished. He's going to win us many titles, as he already has.",

        "content": "For a long time, Vini was the guy who got the benefit of the doubt. He was the heart of the team, the player the crowd defended even when things went wrong.\n\nNowadays he\u2019s been getting booed, and the criticism feels more personal than tactical. It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s doing everything to become the villain in the fans\u2019 eyes.\n\nI\u2019m not taking sides here, just pointing out how quickly someone can become their own worst enemy in the public eye. You can go from hero to scapegoat in one season if you stop being the player the crowd wants you to be. And that shift often has nothing to do with form, and everything to do with perception.  \n",
