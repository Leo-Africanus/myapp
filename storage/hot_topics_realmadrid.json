        "content": "The common opinion on this sub is that Arda needs to play the 10 so that he can create chances for Mbappe. What I am not understanding however is Kroos did not play as a CAM and still created many chances for Madrid and was a key piece of our midfield. I feel like it would make more sense for the 10 to also have the threat of scoring, something that Jude has but Arda really does not. I think a lot of the characterizations of Arda (I love him and he deserves the praise) comes from some early dominance in the season when were playing teams that are really not that competitive. A bunch of those goals come from Mbappe's ability to develop plays considering of course that was what he was used to as a left winger. If Arda is truly that creative would we not see him succeed in the position he currently is in? Honestly I would ideally love to have Bellingham play further up (maybe 9), whoever is best fit in left wing between Mbappe and Vini, Mastantuono right wing, and Arda as 10. I have very limited knowledge so let me know what you guys think :)\n\nAlso please guys I love Arda, and I love the club. Im just trying to have a discussion, sometimes its scary to post here lmao.",

        "content": "COMUNICADO OFICIAL: \n\nReal Madrid C. F. expresses its satisfaction with today's Supreme Court ruling, which once again finds in favour of our club against LaLiga. \n\nThis ruling fully confirms the arguments put forth by Real Madrid against the illegal statutory amendment promoted by LaLiga in 2015. This illegal amendment altered the distribution of the clubs' audiovisual rights. \n\nThe Supreme Court has declared null and void the Second Additional Provision of LaLiga's Statutes, incorporated in 2015 without legal authorisation and aimed at altering the distribution of audiovisual revenues for the 2015-2016 season outside the scope of the law.  \n\n\nAs a result of this nullity, the valid distribution for that season must be that established by the Statutes at the time: \n\n\\* 60% of the revenue for First Division clubs. \n\n\\* 40% for Second Division clubs. \n\n\\* Equal distribution among all clubs within each category. \n\nTherefore, the applicable legal distribution entails the payment of approximately 88 million euros in additional funds, which were illegally withheld, to the clubs that played in the Second Division in the 2015-2016 season: Alav\u00e9s, Albacete, Alcorc\u00f3n, Almer\u00eda, Bilbao Athletic, C\u00f3rdoba, Elche, Gimn\u00e0stic de Tarragona, Girona, Huesca, Legan\u00e9s, Llagostera, Lugo, Mallorca, Mirand\u00e9s, Numancia, Osasuna, Ponferradina, Real Oviedo, Tenerife, Real Valladolid and Real Zaragoza.  \nIt also means that Real Madrid will receive the amount it was legally entitled to, some 8.8 million euros, of which it was also unlawfully deprived. \n\nThis ruling by the Supreme Court restores legality and ensures that decisions affecting Spanish professional football are always taken with full respect for the law and transparency.  \nThe Supreme Court's ruling completely dismisses the appeal filed by LaLiga and ratifies in full the ruling already made in favour of Real Madrid by the National High Court. \n\nThis ruling is of fundamental importance for the economic interests of the clubs that were then playing in the Second Division and for Real Madrid itself. \n\nWith this ruling, the Supreme Court confirms that Real Madrid and the aforementioned clubs were unlawfully damaged by LaLiga's actions.

        "content": "So with rumors increasing about Angelo Stiller potentially being on Madrid\u2019s radar, I\u2019m curious what everyone here thinks in terms of fit and role.\n\nStiller is interesting because he\u2019s not the typical flashy signing. I think he is more of a deep, intelligent midfielder with composure on the ball, very positionally aware, and strong in build-up phases.\n\nIf Madrid actually went for him:\n\n* **Where would he realistically play?** Is he someone you see rotating with Tchouam\u00e9ni as a 6, or more like a Kroos-style left-sided pivot? Could he function as a double-pivot in certain matches?\n* **How would he be used tactically under our current system?** More of a possession controller? Press-resistant recycling guy? Or someone who could unlock play with vertical passes?\n* **Do we think he\u2019d get minutes right away or be a \u201cslow integration\u201d type of signing?** There\u2019s already a crowded midfield, so is this more of a depth/future-planning move or something that would actually change line-ups?\n\nI want to hear from people who watch him regularly like what\u2019s his ceiling, and does he actually make sense for us going forward?\n\nCurious to hear thoughts from the community.",

This is the perfect system for Madrid!! \n\nWe play decent at best and lose: holy shit, idk what's going on with \"insert player/coach\".\n\nHave you not seen how after the first 10 minutes bilbao had incredible chances to score goals and courtois saved us like he always does? \n\nStop seeing everything black and white. One day we are incredible and SOO BACK next day we are horrible and Xabi needs to go.\n\nSame thing for Vini and Xabi, they hugged and this sub: yeah see the media was lying they love each other. \n\nAre you seriously this delusional? There are things going on behind the scenes and it's obvious. Maybe they talked and found a solution. But don't act like there has never been something going on\n\nBe happy about our win but stop acting like everything went fine. It didn't. Mbappe turned up and decided he wanted us to win the match. This didn't look as convincing as most of you act. A more lethal striker of the opponent would have changed this game incredibly fast \n\n",

        "content": "According to Corriere dello Sport, Kenan Yildiz\u2019s contract renewal with Juventus is currently stalled due to\u00a0financial differences and his desire for a central, trophy-oriented role\u00a0within the project. The player, now a key figure on the pitch and the team\u2019s top scorer, is asking for a top-level salary of\u00a06\u20137 million euros, while Juventus has offered just under 5 million (he earns 1,7 million euros plus bonuses atm). \n\nArsenal has recently made approaches and is fascinated by the Juventus number 10, though the club has never set a sale price and he remains under contract until 2029.\u00a0\n\nAmong all suitors,\u00a0Real Madrid stands out as one of the most interested clubs. Xabi Alonso is a long-time admirer, having already wanted Yildiz during his time at Bayer Leverkusen. He has now\u00a0recommended Yildiz to Real Madrid, which continues to monitor his performances closely. Until Juventus and the player reach an agreement on the renewal, further enquiries from major clubs \u2014\u00a0with Real Madrid at the forefront\u00a0\u2014 are expected.",

        "content": "First of all, don\u2019t get me wrong\u2026 Valverde is my favorite player at Real Madrid (especially after Modri\u0107 left), and I\u2019ll always be one of his biggest supporters and admirers. Even if his level drops a little, Fede remains an indispensable player for the team, and I don\u2019t agree with those who constantly criticize him and consider him one of the problems the team is suffering from.\n\nBut I can\u2019t hide the feeling that something has changed in the player\u2019s personality on the pitch\u2026 I\u2019m not talking about his performance right now, but about his character and mindset. You can feel that the current version of the player is \u201cvery dimmed and depressed\u201d and I notice it in his facial expressions\u2026 in his reactions to what happens on the field, especially when celebrating with teammates, or when he misses chances. You feel he\u2019s much less energetic than he used to be. There\u2019s a clear coldness in his current demeanor \u2014 when he talks to players, when he argues with referees\u2026 and that\u2019s unfortunate, especially since he\u2019s one of the team\u2019s leaders, and I've always considered him the heart and soul of the team. \n\nI don\u2019t believe everything that\u2019s being said about a conflict between him and Alonso. I know the press will write just for the sake of writing\u2026 It would be easy for Alonso to bench him and replace him with another player (with all the options available) if he wasn\u2019t satisfied with his level or behavior. But there\u2019s definitely something going on, and I hope I\u2019m wrong.\n\nAm I the only one who feels this way?",
