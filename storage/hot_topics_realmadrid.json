I feel people forget how amazing he is. In his first season he was a top3 player in the world. In his second season, his form fell of for 2 reasons, he played the entire season injured and the season was a shitshow. \n\nI really feel that we should try him as a CF role. The Benz and dembele role. IMO, it was his best role in his first season here. \n\nWe should try putting Mbappe as a LW or along side Jude as a second forward, and Arda behind them. Jude will also allow us to score goals from headers.",

But I always keep seeing comments like \"Cama should take Arda's place, him and Bellingham are creative players too! We don't need Arda for *just* creativity.\" but that's simply not true.\n\nIf you look at the key passes and chances created stats, it is not even close and I wanted to share that.  \nArda already has the same amount of key passes as Camavinga or Tchouameni last season or for big chances, he even matched Bellingham's last season LaLiga performance which is crazy to do this early.  \n  \nThis boy has been a fresh breath of air and made a big shift in our team. And thanks to Dean Huijsen's addition + Xabi's new system and coaching, we can better direct plays, create LOTS OF MORE chances and overall we just play better. Unless someone more creative comes, I don't see Arda being dropped for anyone in the current squad. He is the key glue of our team in terms of connecting the midfield to attack right now.\n\nI also feel like Bellingham and Arda will compliment each other really well and play together. Even though it wasn't good the last match we did that, I think that was just Bellingham coming out of injury a bit early and not being in form.",

        "title": "Comparing the reaction from this Atletico loss to the one from 2 years ago shows how reactionary you guys are when we lose.",
        "content": "Our current season has been incredibly similar to the 23/24 one, we had won every single game, until matchday 6, where we played Atletico, and we lost 3-1 mostly due to headers and Alaba dropping a stinker, and our only goal being a Kroos banger, which sounds very similar to this game, where Huijsen (A lot of people seem to forget that he absolutely should've won the ball on the 2-2 goal) and Carreras dropped a stinker. And as you guys remember, that ended up being our only loss for that entire fucking league campaign, and we went on to win the CL aswell.\n\n\n\nAs you can read in the post match threads, both in [our sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/realmadrid/comments/16r8p8n/post_match_thread_atl_madrid_vs_real_madrid/?sort=top) and on the [soccer](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/16r8o1k/post_match_thread_atletico_madrid_31_real_madrid) sub reddit, the reactions in that season are incredibly similar to what it is right now. And the ''complaints'' that a lot of people had in the 23/24 season are very similar to what we complain about now aswell. Back then, it was about how we didn't sign a Benzema replacement, and now it's how we didn't sign a Kroos replacement.\n\n Let me tell you a few reactions in the post match threads from both the game from 2 years ago and the game from last week:\n\n1: **''If a vulgar team like Atletico can make us look like clowns, I can\u2019t imagine what it will be like once we face the giants of Europe. We are a significantly worst team than the last two years.''**\n\n2: **''it's gonna be a long painful season, buckle up boys''**\n\n\n3: **''This Real team is pretty damn average. Another la liga to Barca.''**\n\n4: **''Three headers scored. Hard to imagine future opponents not pinging crosses in after that defensive performance.''**\n\n5: **''What a fucking embarrassment. Did we win a single aerial ball??? What a joke.''**\n\n6: **''We lost every aerial duel when they crossed, we had no ideas against their bus parking, every of their through balls got through and defense was way to slow to stop them and our mentality was literally not existent. Our defense lost this game.''**\n\n7: **''We need to trade Vini and rodrygo for Haaland.''**\n\n8: **''First big game of the season and Real Madrid already exposed.''**\n\n9: **''Well, guess thats another La Liga we're handing to Barca, again, see you next season''**\n\n10: **''We're so shit and I'm glad we're getting exposed for it. This team needs some serious re-thinking and re-grouping. I bet my left kidney we won't make it out the RO16.''**\n\nI challenge anyone to pinpoint which of these comments are about the 23/24 game, and which is about the game from last week. You wont be able to, which is the entire point. I could include all of the insane comments about ''XabiOut'' and how we need to sell Valverde and 6 other players, but you already know them and you get the idea, now. Thats not to say the honest criticisms toward Xabi or the players are invalid, they are valid, 100%. Its just how you guys will turn up the temperature from ''This player needs to to better here'' into ''The league is lost, sell this player and sack the manager'' at the first chance you get. Seriously, now that we've gotten a big win in the CL and we've been able to cool down since the Atletico game, go back into the match thread and see read some of the comments that are being posted and upvoted as the game is going, its fucking lunacy.\n\nYou guys had the exact same bombastic reactions to the loss in 23/24, which ended up being the best league campaign since the 11/12 season.\n\nThe same fans that post stuff like the ''1% chance, 99% faith'' things, about how we never give up as Madridistas, are now the same people that go ''League is lost, lets sell 5 players in the winter window and #XabiOut''.\n\nLike, yes, it sucks hard that we lost, especially with 5 goals conceded against a disgusting nazi club, but you guys are reacting as if half of our players fucking died or something.\n\nXabi got the starting XI wrong, and definitely got the subs wrong too, Jude shouldn't have started, he needs more gametime to get back into it after this long injury, starting against Atleti wasn't a good idea, and i feel like Huijsen should do better on the 2-2 goal, and Arda's high kick was stupid. I think if Arda stays, we score 1 more goal and the momentum could've shifted in our favour. Way too many dumbass fouls this game, 1 of which resulted in the free kick goal.\n\nBut holy fuck, will you guys calm down? No, we dont need to sell Fede/Cama/Vini or whoever the fuck you dipshits are calling for to be sold. And no, Xabi doesn't deserve to be sacked.\n\nAlso, stop calling for Rodrygo to start over Vini, this player will continue to do nothing, like he has in the 9 months in the league without a goal or assist.\n\nMy general point is:\n\n#Please calm the fuck down, you guys had the exact same reaction 2 years ago and that season ended up being one of the most succesful league campaigns in Madrid history, and the 15th CL to go along with it.",

        "content": "Some legends are born, some are made, and some survive everything history throws at them. Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s was all three.\n\n\n\nIn the 1950s, he was the star of Hungary\u2019s Mighty Magyars, the team that changed football forever. Short, stocky, and left-footed, Pusk\u00e1s wasn\u2019t built like a classic athlete. But when the ball came to that left foot, it was magic \u2014 thunderous strikes, precise passes, goals from impossible angles. Hungary went unbeaten for four years, humiliated England at Wembley in 1953, and reached the World Cup final in 1954. Pusk\u00e1s was the heartbeat of it all.\n\nBut then came politics and tragedy. The Hungarian Uprising of 1956 forced him into exile. He was branded a traitor, banned from football for two years, and at 31, many thought his career was finished. Overweight, aging, and with no club, it looked like the world had seen the last of Pusk\u00e1s.\n\nAnd then came Madrid. Real Madrid took a gamble, and what followed was one of the greatest second acts in football history. Slimmed down and reborn, Pusk\u00e1s formed a devastating partnership with Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano. Together they turned Madrid into the ultimate powerhouse of European football. Pusk\u00e1s scored goals for fun \u2014 hat-tricks, four in a European Cup final, even a famous five-goal haul in a Cl\u00e1sico against Barcelona.\n\nIn total, he scored 242 goals in 262 games for Real Madrid \u2014 numbers so outrageous they barely seem real. He won 3 European Cups, 5 league titles, and a Pichichi trophy four times. For a man who was supposed to be finished, it was pure redemption.\n\nWhat made Pusk\u00e1s beloved wasn\u2019t just the goals, though. It was his humanity. He was humble, warm, a joker in the dressing room. Fans called him \u201cPancho,\u201d and in Madrid he wasn\u2019t seen as a foreigner but as family.\n\nWhen he finally retired, he left behind not just records but a legacy of resilience. He had been a golden boy in Hungary, an outcast in exile, and then a reborn legend in Spain. Today, FIFA\u2019s award for the best goal of the year carries his name \u2014 the Pusk\u00e1s Award \u2014 a fitting tribute to the man whose left foot was poetry.\n\nFerenc Pusk\u00e1s wasn\u2019t just a footballer. He was proof that genius can\u2019t be broken by politics, age, or exile. For many, he will always be remembered as the exiled genius who conquered Madrid and the world.",

        "content": "Cause he seems extremely naive in big games. We saw the first cracks during his EL final vs Atalanta where he came out with a weird ass lineup trying to be clever just to get dunked on but freaking Lookman. \n\nNext season, he got schooled by Bayern in the CL KO stages. And now the same thing happened vs Atletico. This is the problem with young system managers, they will refuse to be pragmatic always insisting on imposing said system. But for some weird reason, the game that matters the most, the decide to switch away from the formula which brought them success. \n\nPep had that same habit, and the season he decides to not play mad scientist with his lineups, he finally gets City their CL. Zidane played 3 CL finals, and the only swap in the entire lineups for all 3 lineups was Isco for Bale kin 2017 and 2018. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\n\nFor now the challenge for him is to find a tactical setup that gets the best out of everyone. I'm not worried about that part. But for god's sake, when those big games come, DON'T TRY TO PLAY GENIUS AND JUST THROW YOUR USUAL LINEUP OUT THERE.",
