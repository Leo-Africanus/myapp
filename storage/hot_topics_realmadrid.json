Regarding this statement, I couldn\u2019t agree more. Even though Mbappe has his flaws, he is showing up to play every game and is the reason we are where we are. Him and Courtois, no matter how bad of a game they have, will always have my respect. Regarding on what he said, we have been lacking grit and desire. We are also extremely inconsistent. Ever since the 4-0 loss to psg at the cwc, Madrid had found something that clicked at the beginning of the season. Everyone was pressing, we were winning games, playing good football, and until that altercation between Xabi and Vini, all came downhill. Xabi wasn\u2019t the problem and it\u2019s obvious, the players are. A \u201cteam of champions\u201d doesn\u2019t kick out a manger and does what they want. This team badly needs to rebuild not only physically but also mentally and gain a lot more maturity and the hunger to win again. ",

They saw us sitting in 3rd in the UCL and thought they were safe, so they played like dogshit against Benfica.

        "content": "Again and again, last season's loss is already enough to show that we can't just listen to the players, we got to build up new system, put in new tactic just like Jose and Capello did. It's usual for players to get fired up and work hard for a few games after coach change, but the problem will still occur. Now we did fine in the league, but lost Copa Del Rey and slip down to playoff. \n\nXabi was trying to do it but he wasn't tough enough when he shouldn't back off. \n\nLike I said before:\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/realmadrid/comments/1qjlnke/i_think_there_is_a_wrong_take_xabis_problem_was/\n\nIt was also a bad time to fire him. At least let him do the job first. But it already happened, so I wish Arbeloa to learn this.\n\nAgain ppl get it wrong, Real Madrid's success is not just \"give the players freedom\", we pick the right coach in the right time. Jose brought us discipline and spirit when we couldn't find direction, then Carlo give some freedom/tactical changes to bring balance. Zizou is kinda in the middle of them. His 2nd spell also requested strict discipline especially in defense.\n\nAt least Arbeloa could try to do what Solari did as a caretaker, give youngsters chance and bench some veterans.",

        "content": "I have been a fan since 2002. I cant remember the last time I have missed a Real Madrid match in the past 20 years. \n\nWe have had alot of generations come and go, but I havent seen a roster that make me feel this indifferent about the players themselves before.\n\nIt is really not about not winning. I was there during the Pep era. We lost 6-2 and we lost 5-0 but that team had a heart. That team had a soul. \n\nThe current roster feels souless. There is no Charisma in the team, even unhinged Pepe and Ramos are way more likable than our current roster. The difference is that previous rosters they did not demand respect they earned it by being warriors.\n\nThere is no collective goal. There is no sacrifice. They are not willing to do the dirty work. We have players that will throw tantrums if they don't play 90 minutes. Vini should have been subbed out today but we saw what happened last time Xabi tried to do that. \n\nVini's personality and attitude is one of the main reasons. He has been clutch and has won us some silverware but he has tarnished any good will he has created. The precedent he set in El Classico where he made a public tantrum against Xabi was disgusting and I dont know why my fellow fans dont see how bad of a precedent he has set. Alvaro A. Says that Vini wears his heart on his sleeve but I call bullshit. We were winning the classico and Vini made it all about him, he is selfish. With the salary he wants and the minutes he wants, every game he needs to perform like that monaco game and we all know that is fact that he dissapears more than he performs\n\nEven if we manage to win the CL and La Liga somehow. I really dont feel good about the group of players.",
