Courtois was rotating with Navas in 18-19 but started more games than both.\n\nCourtois is super solid and got the guts to encourage/yell at the team. Nor do we see him having beef with any RM coaches. I have been big fan of him since his ATM years, you can rewatch the 13-14 final, he made many good saves and forced a 92:48 miracle.",

Do they expect us to come fill the stadium and clap for this shit show and inflated egos. \n\nI started following Real since Cristiano only, so I don\u2019t exactly know the 90\u2019s and 00\u2019s so you may think i\u2019m overreacting. But I did go through post-CR7 phase and man it was tough, but I know what this club embodies and the recent behaviour is definitely not it. And I know Papa Perez enough that cares about money. So if the club only listens to the money, then that\u2019s the language we speak too.\n\nThis season\u2019s ticket sales done already but hold off on next season\u2019s purchase. Skip the stadium. IMO empty seats louder message than tifo.\n\nLet viewership drop. From where i come from, it\u2019s pay per view model. So im not gonna bother paying and stay up late night, sacrificing my sleep, just to watch some of them walk around and whine.\n\nDon\u2019t buy merch too. Honestly Adidas is scamming us big time. I mean look at ours, Leeds Ubited and Liverpool jersey. Same design. Zero effort.\n\nNot sure how many agree with me or how big of an impact the above may create, but no point in venting online if we don\u2019t try and send a message. \n\nPeace out &amp; Hala Madrid",
