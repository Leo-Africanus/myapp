I think we've always been lucky when it comes to goalkeepers. Even Lunin was brilliant for us last season.\n\nBut honestly I've never felt safe with any other GK like I feel these years with Courtois. Except for his first season, I think Courtois has been the most consistent keeper for us. Casillas, with all respect, used to have some obvious flaws, like dealing with aerial balls and crosses (he was very poor with his feet as well). Navas was a bit inconsistent comparing to Casillas (in his prime) and Courtois, but I have massive respect for him too.\n\nCourtois is just perfect in every possible way.. his 2021/22 season might be the best that I've ever seen for a GK, especially in Champions League. His performance against Liverpool in the final is unmatched, in my opinion. \n\nHe will never play over 700 games for us like Casillas, and he might not end up being the RM keeper with most titles. But in my opinion, he's the best that I've ever seen.. and in my Top 3 GKs of all times (with Buffon + Neuer). I hope he still has 3 or 4 more years in him, because replacing him will be hard.",

WE ARE JUST FANS. NONE OF US ARE QUALIFIED TO TOUCH THE GRASS. PLEASE DONT BE SERIOUS.\n\n  \n\\-----------\n\nMy Real Madrid GEGENPRESS football. 90 min press with super high defense line that relies on offside traps and physicality to harass forwards.\n\nLineup is 3-4-3 -&gt; 3-3-1-2-1 in possession : [https://imgur.com/a/njaWOAO](https://imgur.com/a/njaWOAO)\n\nAscensio and Rudiger as Wide Center Backs with Tchouameni in the middle organizing the whole line and playing the ball to midfielders in the build up.\n\nValverde and Camavinga as wide midfielders, defensively they support the backline and press the opposition wingers/wingbacks. Offensively they present passing options in wider spaces and cover some of the central spaces forward as more players move into the box. They can also play more centered and form the midfield trio with Guler while Rodrygo and Vinicius play more wider roles.\n\nGuler and Bellingham are my main engines in the midfield. Guler is the creative outlet and Bellingham is the work horse. Guler will hold the ball more often and link with the wide midfielders for options forming a midfield trio (Cama, Fede, Guler) while looking to unlock the defense with killer balls to the final thirds. Jude will move forward with and without the ball and form a trio with Rodrygo and Vinicius. He will be a Muller-esk Ramdeuter.\n\nVinicius and Rodrygo are the central forwards. Flexible in positioning and expected to play close together with Jude. Synergy is needed for one-two passes that unlocks any deep defense. But they are also expected to dribble and shoot as much as possible. Expected to press hard when out of possession.\n\nMbappe will have to turn into a Poacher. His job is to lock defenders with him and finish any half chances we get. The team pressing high and crowding the edge of the area will allow lots of balls inside the box. Kylian is expected to pick them up. Expected to press hard when out of possession.\n\n  \nPlaystyle will be a high intensity passing with players generally being close to eachother. Beating defense with dribbling and one-two link ups. NO FUCKING CROSSES.\n\n  \nHow many goals do you think we will concede?\n\nHow many injuries per season?",

Like for example the claim that Zidane\u2019s three-peat is down more to how excellent of a Madrid side that was rather than his own tactical prowess or whatever \n\nI wasn\u2019t following football as much as I do now back in that era, so any of you who\u2019ve been there week in week out during that time and witnessed his rotations, his tactics, his adaptations to opponents from different European leagues, how true is that claim?\n\nAnd tbf this is not just one myth I wanna debunk, the online discourse is full of nonsense about coaches and a lot of the talk is trying to discredit hard working people out of pure hatred.\n\n",
