        "content": "Yesterday\u2019s 4-0 defeat to PSG was painful, no doubt. But honestly I think this loss might actually help us in the long run.\n\nThis game clearly exposed some of our weak spots  especially in defense and up front. I hope this pushes the club to fully utilize the transfer window. We need proper reinforcements not just backups, but solid starters.\n\nYes, we\u2019ve got Vini and Mbapp\u00e9, but let's be real: they\u2019re not center-forwards. They thrive as wingers. Sure, Mbapp\u00e9 scored tons last season, but when did those goals come? Against who? When it mattered most  vs Liverpool,  Arsenal, and nowPSG  he went missing.\n\nDid you notice yesterday how PSG\u2019s attackers pressed our keeper and center-backs constantly? Meanwhile, our front three were waiting for quick counters  but to counter, you need the ball first. PSG controlled possession and suffocated our build-up.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about blaming individuals. The CB error? It happens. But the overall system looked off  (not xabi's fault) and that\u2019s why I\u2019m hoping the club realizes we need a true striker, more depth in defense, and maybe a few others with the hunger to fight in games like these.\n\nJust my take. I know some may disagree  and that\u2019s totally fair. I just love this club and want us to improve from here.\n\nHala Madrid. \ud83e\udd0d",

I agree that this was not the time to experiment with formation, but how is Xabi meant to prevent mistakes like acensio and rudiger made? People are forgetting how much better we played for every match before this other than maybe the first one for obvious reasons because it was his first match with the team. He hasn\u2019t been coaching them for long, and PSG is arguably the best team in the world right now and literally just won the champions league so it\u2019s expected that they will play incredibly well. \n\nXabi can try his best to improve the team but if the players keep playing like this and making lazy mistakes then there is not much he can do, he\u2019s not magic. Xabi isn\u2019t the problem the players are, which should be obvious but apparently some people think no after one bad game Xabi is a bad coach and worse than Carlo and the team is back to how they were last season. \n\nOn a positive, at least we have a bit more time before laliga",

        "content": "When PSG were drawn against Real Madrid, everyone expected a PSG win. They had prime Mbappe, Neymar, Messi, and Di Mar\u00eda. And us? We had Karim, a developing Vinicius, Modric, and Courtois. Our squad had flaws. Kroos was struggling, Casemiro wasn\u2019t sharp, and every time the ball neared Carvajal, we panicked. All our hopes were on Courtois, Modri\u0107, Vini, and of course, Benzema, the man carrying our attack since Ronaldo's departure.\n\nBut when the scoreboard read 0\u20132 in the 60th minute, all hope seemed lost. Madrid fans were chanting Mbappe's name instead of chanting our own players. Then came the moment that changed everything: a 17-minute hat-trick from the best player in the world that night which launched a campaign of goals and elite playmaking. Everyone talks about the Manchester City game and rightfully so but this game against PSG was just as legendary.\n\nStill, the headlines from CBS with Jamie, ESPN etc focused on PSG\u2019s collapse rather than the brilliance of Benzema, who scored a knockout-stage hat-trick while losing 0\u20132 in 17 minutes. He never got the praise he deserved, not even from Madrid fans, despite a better big-game resume than Suarez or Lewa without being the focal point of attack until 2019 and never being a traditional No. 9.",

        "content": "Just wanted to see what you guys think about today's game. Extremely disappointing mistakes considering they are both professionals playing at the highest level in football and for one of the best teams to ever exist. \n\nRudiger was non existent in 3rd goal, apparently makes the same mistake in every pressure game . The mistake leading to 2nd goal , I don't even know what to say. \n\nEdit: A lot of people defending rudiger for what he did today? I have never seen a player miss a ball like that, NEVER let alone a starting CB for Real Madrid ! It shows how bad we have fallen! \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f And if you think Rudiger was elite last season, go watch the matches where we actually played decent teams, and count how many times he was caught off position, how many times has he tried to press someone and left space where a boeing could pass through, and how many of those caused us to concede goals ! Then we can have a conversation on how elite he has been and how he carried us last season! \n\nAny average CB would get the job done against smaller teams when most of the game is played in the opponent's half. True test comes when you play against an actual decent team and Rudiger was exposed in every one of these games last season. ",

        "content": "People seriously need to calm down about this loss.\n\nYes, losing 4-0 to PSG hurts, but the overreactions are getting out of control. I\u2019ve seen people say Mbapp\u00e9 is the worst signing we\u2019ve made in the last years. Really? The same Mbapp\u00e9 who\u2019s had a goal or assist in every final since he joined? The same player who was basically carrying us in every El Cl\u00e1sico? Without him, some of those games would\u2019ve looked like 4-0 or 5-1 defeats. Even against City in the second leg, he was the only one who showed up and scored.\n\nAnd now people are turning on Arda G\u00fcler too, saying he can\u2019t start against top teams. This guy started five games during the Club World Cup and looked sharp. In this PSG game, he was thrown into a midfield where he was completely isolated. Bellingham couldn\u2019t do much either, and Valverde was played as a right-back. What exactly was G\u00fcler supposed to do?\n\nSame with Gonzalo Garc\u00eda. He played against arguably the best team in the world right now, in a side that\u2019s still finding itself. And people are already calling him not good enough? It\u2019s been a handful of games.\n\nThen there\u2019s Tchouam\u00e9ni. Suddenly he \u201ccan\u2019t perform against top teams\u201d? That makes no sense. The real issue wasn\u2019t the midfield or the attack \u2014 it was the defense. All four defenders had an off-day. Simple as that. We conceded goals through errors you\u2019d expect from Sunday league players.\n\nXabi Alonso\u2019s only been working with this squad for five games. Five. He was basically using last season\u2019s team, without his new signings. What exactly are people expecting? Miracles?\n\nThis is the best PSG team ever. This club is in their prime. No one\u2019s been able to touch them. And yet some fans are acting like this one result erases everything we\u2019ve done and all the potential this team still has.",

        "title": "What we should do going foward",
        "content": "First I want to start off that none of this is xabis fault. He barely had any time with the players for this tournament.  His system can work very well for us if he has the full backing of the board and Perez.\n\nStarting off with the defense: Rudiger is clearly not what he used to be, knee injury or not, he is not Real Madrid level anymore and we need to accept that. Him and Alaba need to go. Send acensio on a loan for him to develop better and come back stronger. Fran is good against the mid teams but fumbles under giants, the Carreras signing is well needed. Militao and carvajal did more than what our entire defense did in 20 minutes. They should stay as backups. Huijsen is absolutely critical to have as he is the only defender that can build from the back and pass. We need to sign another CB ASAP. I was hoping we would get saliba but konate looks more realistic but I would not mind him either. I think he could compliment huijsen pretty well. \n\n\nMidfield: it is so evident that we NEED a creative midfielder. Right now arda is the closest thing we have to that but he still has a lot to learn. Bringing in someone like stiller or a profile similar to Kroos is crucial for breaking defensive lines. Valverde is NOT a RB and should never be placed there again. Even though he did well there last season, it won\u2019t work with Alonso\u2019s system. Bellingham should\u2019ve gotten his shoulder surgery after we got knocked out the UCL so he could be fully ready for next season. \n\n\nAttack: Vini\u2026. Oh Vini. He is absolutely useless. I know I will get hate for that but he can\u2019t keep getting away with this. He doesn\u2019t do anything. Doesn\u2019t press, doesn\u2019t track back, hogs the ball, tries to dribble like prime Messi, can\u2019t pass etc etc.. I always defended Vini even after the 24/25 ended but I can\u2019t defend him anymore. He needs to be sold, we will get no where with him. Ever since that ballon dor snub, he\u2019s not been the same. Trust me I am grateful for everything he has done for this club but it\u2019s time. Him and mbappe didn\u2019t work and it never will work. We should put our full trust in mbappe in the attack. Put him alongside Gonzalo or Franco, and he\u2019ll cook. Let him get the well needed rest. Gonzalo is the Joselu type profile that we needed. Not a good game today but he\u2019s fresh and inexperienced, let him grow. I love how he presses and tracks back too. Rodrygo is clearly going to leave so I don\u2019t want to say anything about him, especially since he barely got any minutes. \n\nOverall, we need to trust xabi because his system really works wonders. We just need to give him the players he needs and asks for. Players that works with his style of play and we will cook next season. I hope this was a wake up call for Perez and that we shouldn\u2019t stop with Carreras. Sign sign sign, how ever many players he needs. Give him full backing. So far we got huijsen, Trent, Franco, and Carreras. Konate/Saliba and stiller will be perfect too. Maybe also another ST but I believe in Gonzalo. But most importantly, I believe in Xabi Alonso. Bring the treble home \ud83c\udfc6 \ud83c\udfc6 \ud83c\udfc6. \n\nEdit: I did not touch on mbappe much because I want to see how he plays without Vini first in this system. But yes, he is also very lazy and needs to work on that too but he\u2019s still incredibly much better than Vini. And I do think we should build the team around him because right now we don\u2019t and he feeds off that. He\u2019ll get more goals that way and ultimately that\u2019s what he\u2019s here for. ",

I came all the way from Ithaca to watch the game, bought a shirt and a hat to hopefully get one or two autographs.\n\nI waited through the evening, then the night, then the rain, then the early morning. By 2-3 a.m., I was the only one still there. No expectations anymore, just hoping for a small moment.\n\nWhen the players finally returned, I couldn\u2019t see well (I\u2019m nearsighted), so I held up my phone just to try and get a clearer view of who was coming in.\n\nA security guard (who was there all the time, I even talked to him before) assumed I was trying to film or sneak pictures and kept flashing a light in my face.\n\nI understand their job is to protect the players, and maybe from their perspective, I looked suspicious. But it just kind of stung. I was alone, silent, respectful. Not trying to cross any lines. Just wanted a memory.\n\nNothing came of it in the end, but I guess that\u2019s part of the experience too.\n\nMuch respect to all the fans out there who\u2019ve gone through something similar \u2014 it\u2019s not always glamorous, but sometimes it\u2019s still worth it.",
