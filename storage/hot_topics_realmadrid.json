        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm a Turkish football fan and have been a Galatasaray supporter all my life. Apart from my club, I\u2019ve also followed Liverpool and, because of my father, had a soft spot for Bar\u00e7a for as long as I can remember. But things started to change when Arda G\u00fcler joined Real Madrid.\n\nAt first, when Arda moved to Fenerbah\u00e7e(our rival) which made me pretty upset. It felt like we\u2019d lost this incredible wonderkid, who has possibility to became the kind of classic number 10 you don\u2019t see much anymore. Still, I love football and I was happy to see such talent would represent our national team.\n\nBut then my man made the move to Real Madrid. Again, it made me a bit sad at first, another \u201crival\u201d team, in a way, but I couldn\u2019t help following him. Since he arrived, I haven\u2019t missed any of his minutes and watched most Real Madrid games over the last two years, always hoping to see him subbed on.\n\nSomewhere along the way, things changed. After Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s goal yesterday, I realized I was actually celebrating like a true Madrid fan. And when I think back to this year\u2019s El Cl\u00e1sico, I was genuinely upset after the loss.\n\nSo I guess it\u2019s official, after being a Gala fan, I can proudly say I\u2019ve become a Madridista. \ud83e\udd0d",

Tchouam\u00e9ni runs the back line and steps up to plug gaps; Trent inverting to hit those flat balls to Vini and Mbapp\u00e9 sprinting the channels. If Dean is fit he starts at LCB; Carreras holds the left width; G\u00fcler and Valverde own the half-spaces; and Bellingham roams as a free 10 for second balls. We beat Bar\u00e7a\u2019s box midfield, punish their high line, protect transitions, and add set-piece threat. \n\nIf Dean is not fit, we keep Vini and Mbapp\u00e9 high and split so they can sprint into the channels instead of getting crowded on the wing, lets Bellingham float as a free 10 (not a stuck-on No.9), and uses Trent inside with G\u00fcler to thread those quick, flat balls in behind. Tchouam\u00e9ni organizes the back three, Camavinga cleans up the left half-space, and Valverde covers the Trent invert so we\u2019re dangerous without losing control. The classic 4-3-3 tends to isolate Vini, makes Mbapp\u00e9 either redundant on the left or static through the middle, and exposes us in transition with both fullbacks high. Let me know what you guys think",

Since Kroos and Modric left, Jude's role has become way deeper and obviou sly that has impacted his scoring and assisting, because his role has transitioned.\n\nArda has been good this season, no doubt. And for nostalgia merchants, might even bring back some Ozil-CR memories.\nBut that is who he is, an Ozil - a pure no. 10 playmaker.\n\nNot mentioning others, because Arda is the one who is SUPPOSEDLY better than Jude according to popular opinion here.\n\nJude on the other hand, can play all positions in the field. Has better finishing, weak-foot heading, tackling, ball control, balance, stamina, positioning and almost equally good passing (Arda may be slightly better at through balls or equal). \n\nJude can do literally everything that any of our other midfielders can do (and do it as well as them). On top of all this, Jude's mentality which enables him to turn around any match on its head, will always give him an edge. At 21, he's the guy mangers, fans, and teammates turn to, when the going gets tough - there's no bigger compliment.\n\n\nThis sub is so dumb and reactionary at times, its infuriating p",

        "content": "We are going to play another big match against Barcelona without really nailing down our best XI and formation. The same thing happened against PSG and Atletico when we chopped and changed our way to incorporate big players returning, resulting in complete tactical disharmony among players. \nThings would be tried and tested for the first time in this 4 at the back system whether it is Bellingham as number 10, Arda as DLP or Arda behind Mbappe/ Bellingham Box to Box. \nNot really sure whether Mastantuono keeps his place as he looks out of sorts on that RW losing possession non stop. His connection has been feeble with CMs and other Forwards. Reminds me a bit of Endrick and Guler trying to prove a point last season. \n\nIf Rodrygo starts on the RW, that will also be the first time him starting in that position for us this season. \n\nIf Camavinga replaces Tchouameni, you can never know what could happen. \n\nWe might field a setup never tried before vs Barca and that concerns me.

        "content": "The dude has all the flair, finesse and physicality to be a monster B2B Number 6. Playing him as Number 10 would be akin to playing Xavi Hernandez as Number 10, sure he can do great and has all the ability but the team would suffer a lot in the midfield and recovery transitions when we will lose the ball. Arda is a machine in releasing very deadly passes between the lines and has that Number 10 technique through and through in turning, feint and making the markers life miserable. He is not good in getting into CM positions to provide a passing option when the pressing is too fast paced. IMO, Jude can still switch with Arda when our wingers have the ball and Jude has to crash the box. Then Arda can go deep. \n\nBut, playing from the back , I truly believe Arda has to stay in front of Jude just behind Mbappe.",
