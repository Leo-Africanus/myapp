Overall, the lead is deserved however \n\n46' - 2nd half underway \n\n\u26bd 56' - GOLLLL DEL CASTILLA - fast attack with lots of space for Pol Fortuny - Gonzalo makes the run into the box and Pol puts an easy pass into his run, Gonzalo's first touch is perfect, and he finishes softly with the inside of his boot against the far post and into the net! \n\n\u26bd 58' - goal for Marbella right after the kick off - and it's our former player Jos\u00e9 Callej\u00f3n who scores, just like in the first match. He initiates the attack himself, dribbling past our midfield and playing it out wide - his teammate lays it off to him in the box with the back of his heel, and he comes running at the ball full speed to finish it past Fran \n\n60' - massive chance to immediately restore the 2-goal lead, another top cross from Yusi from the left to the far post, where Pol Fortuny broke free of his marker but sadly has to finish on the volley with this weak foot, and he puts it just wide of the far post \n\n\u26bd 65' - GOLLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - Marbella take risks and leave lots of space for us to counter - Ribes recovers the ball at the edge of our box, plays it to Chema, who launches a perfect long ball to Victor Mu\u00f1oz - who once again escapes his opponents, and squares it perfecrly to Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, he pokes it past the keeper with the tip of his boot for the 3-1! \n\n70' - Gonzalo hits the post, what a play by him! - he is through on the left side in a 2v3 counter, he takes on the fullback and turns past him with a quick change of direction, then he leaves another opponent behind in the same manner, his finish is almost perfect, but it hits the post, runs across the goal line and goes out for a goal kick on the other side \n\n\ud83d\udd04 74' - triple sub, Yusi, Chema and Z\u00fa\u00f1iga off for Valde, Antonio David and Campos\n\n80' - big chance for V\u00edctor to seal the match, Pol Fortuny releases a through ball for him to chase, and once again he launches like a rocket and outruns the defender by a bit margin, but he fails to put his finish on target with only the keeper to bear\n\n\ud83d\udd04 81' - C\u00e9sar Palacios is back from his ACL tear after 9 months! He comes on for Pol Fortuny. \n\n\ud83d\udd04 90' - last sub, Borja for V\u00edctor \n\n\u26bd 90'+2 - goal for Marbella, golazo by Soto - a bit out of nowhere, he cuts inside from the right wing and blasts an absolute missile out with his left foot, it hits the net in the top left corner \n\n90'+4 - good chance for Marbella for the late equaliser, Ribes fails to clear a ball in our box and the Marbella player fires the rebound over the bar \n\nFT - victory that became unnecessarily tight in the end, with Castilla wasting chances on the counter and Marbella getting a lifeline in added time with a great goal. The team keeps the possibilities of reaching the playoffs alive with this win, but it will still be very difficult, 4 points behind the last playoff spots with only 3 matches to go \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 18:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee**: \u00c1lvaro C\u00e1novas Garc\u00eda-Villarrubia\n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 2, Matchday 35\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[FEF TV](https://feftv.com) (subscription - 12.99\u20ac/month)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (5-2-3): Fran Gonz\u00e1lez - Youssef Enr\u00edquez \u2018Yusi\u2019 (74' V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as 'Valde'), Edgar Pujol, Mario Rivas, Quique Ribes, David Jim\u00e9nez - Jos\u00e9 Maria Andr\u00e9s \u2018Chema\u2019 (74' Antonio David), Pol Fortuny (81' C\u00e9sar Palacios) - Gonzalo Garc\u00eda, Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga (74' Andr\u00e9s Campos), V\u00edctor Mu\u00f1oz (90' Borja Alonso) \n\nBench: Mario de Luis (GK), Diego Pi\u00f1eiro (GK), Lorenzo Aguado, David Ruiz, Babacar Diocou. \n\nUnavailable: Ra\u00fal Asencio (first team call-up), Jacobo Ram\u00f3n (first team call-up), David Cuenca (pubalgia), Manuel \u00c1ngel (?), Jeremy de Le\u00f3n (shoulder injury). \n\nCoach: Ra\u00fal\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** DDDWL\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 10th | 46pt | 10-16-8 | 51:34\n",

        "content": "The Unify League is set to start in September of 2026. It will have a huge impact on the footballing world with every match free to watch through high-paying advertisers and with the UEFA middleman out of the equation.\n\nNow the proposal features strict financial sustainability rules (FSR) which will have an effect on many teams who want to participate. \"European club competitions should be governed by the clubs as they are domestically, not by third parties who benefit without taking any risk. The governance structure must be fully compliant with EU law. To improve sustainability, spending should be based only on resources generated, not from competition-distorting capital injections. Financial Sustainability rules should allow clubs to only spend a fixed percentage of their annual football-related revenue on player salaries and net transfers with appropriate provisions for smaller clubs and transition rules.\"(https://a22sports.com/en/about-a22/)\n\nHaaland's 10-year contract could possibly be in preparation for the Unify League. Many players who want to play at the top league (Star League) of the Unify League will present transfer opportunities that Madrid can take advantage of. But the general idea is that there is uncertainty about what will happen, and with Florentino being a key figure in the league, his frugality means he knows something besides the stadium renovation payments. \n\nI believe this summer and the following are going to explode with transfers with the competition starting in the following year. I'm interested to see what will happen, and there really is no reason for the competition to be delayed anymore due to the CJEU ruling giving the green light. ",

This is not just about a number; it represents creativity, leadership, and elegance on the pitch \u2014 all qualities that Modri\u0107 embodied for more than a decade. The next wearer of the 10 shirt will carry not only tactical responsibility but also the symbolic weight of replacing a club legend. Real Madrid has not always had special players wearing this number like diarra robinho and james rodriguez, i think for 20 years just modric deserved that number. Now the eyes of fans around the world are turning to the current and incoming squad members to see who could be next in line. \n\nArda?  (Mypick)\n\nMbappe?\n\nRodrygo?\n\nWirtz?\n\nEndrick?",

The way people are roasting him for walking out for free is hilarious. Prem fans from every corner of the globe are uniting to cook him like he\u2019s the main course. Some of the tweets are so brutal that I feel like he might not make it to Madrid in one piece. One post called him Judas with a better crossing stat\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. Honestly, it\u2019s hilarious watching the entire football world lose their minds over this.Trent\u2019s probably regretting ever dreaming of the Bernabeu right now but let's give a massive shoutout to P\u00e9rez even though hes done dog shit this season, for pulling off this heist of the century snagging Trent for zero euros!!!! His strategy is pure genius he'll targets world class players like Trent in their contract's final year, letting clubs sweat then jumping in for free or low cost deals, saving millions for us while building an empire. Leaving for free has turned Trent from one of the most loved footballers into football's public enemy number one.\r\n",

        "content": "It is may now and the season is coming to a close. The only thing we have left to play for is la liga and that will be decided this coming weekend. We\u2019ve had what most would consider a disappointing season. We didn\u2019t beat a single top team in any competition (other than man city), champions league ended in embarrassment, and we lost the CDR final in humiliating way. But there are a few takeaways to for next season that should give us real hope.\n\n1. Injury returns- Having lost Carvajal AND Militao to early season injuries was damning. We played without a quality right back all season and it showed. No balance, and no real athleticism in the right side of defense (militao helped with this as well). Having these two back will make our defense look completely different next season. People call out the midfield for being dysfunctional but they\u2019re used to playing with Carvajal who can usually be found streaking up and down the right side assisting wherever needed. Midfield, attack, defense- it doesn\u2019t matter, because Carvajal is essential to all of it. Militao with his closing speed will certainly be a difference in defense when compared to the likes of Rudiger and alaba, who appears to be declining very rapidly in particular. \n\n2. Trent Alexander-Arnold- This point kind of goes hand in hand with the one above, but it deserves it\u2019s own point because I think this transfer is massive for Real Madrid. While I believe TAA will probably find himself at CB a few times next season, when he\u2019s on the right side this team will be straight up unplayable. Valverde, rodrygo/guler on the right side with Trent racing behind, creates a dual threat from left to right which has not been seen since the Ronaldo/bale days. When the right side becomes dangerous, we will see mbappe shine- trust me.\n\n3. Arda guler- Arda Guler is Real Madrids next midfield maestro, and it\u2019s only just begun. Passing, dribbling, shooting, hold-up play. He\u2019s got it all. He passes all the eyeball tests, and he has stats to prove it. We\u2019ve needed someone with his subtlety all season in midfield and we\u2019ve been starved. This is one of my main gripes with ancelotti is that he only switches the system when it\u2019s too late or things are getting dire. Irregardless, we can anticipate him to get more playing time and I predict that midfield is his and his alone by the end of next season\n\n4. We already have fantastic players- Yes, the team wasn\u2019t the best this season. And yes, some of our BEST players has some dreadful games this season. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that this is the best team on paper in the whole world. One bad season doesn\u2019t change the fact that we have truly WORLD CLASS players all over the pitch. I will never be convinced that a team that contains, courtois, militao, valverde, Tchouameni, mbappe, vini, etc. is more than a transfer window or two away from a treble.\n\n5. We beat man city- This is one is more of a feel-good reason. Yes, they\u2019re not at their best this season but it felt REALLY good to beat them the way we did. \n\nWe did not have the best season, and I\u2019m more than frustrated that Barcelona is going to considered better than us, but I think they\u2019re just dealing with some growing pains at the moment. Hala Madrid \n\nPardon the spelling.",

        "title": "Transfer Plan Before the 25/26 Season Starts",
        "content": "Currently, we have 22 players in the first-team squad. That number will drop to 19 after this season, as the contracts of Modric, Vallejo, and V\u00e1zquez will expire. Generally, the management like to have a 23-man squad, so they will add at least four players to the first team\u2014through contract renewals, transfers, or promotions.\n\nThey will promote Asencio and add Trent to the squad, which means they will bring in two more players.\n\nNow the question is: what will the club do?\n\n**My Prediction:**\n\n* They\u2019ll talk with Xavi and discuss Modric\u2019s situation.\n* They\u2019ll also talk about which position they want to strengthen.\n* Lastly, they\u2019ll look at potential outgoings. Most likely, they\u2019ll try to sell Alaba and Mendy to free up space.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think either of them will actually leave. I also think they\u2019ll renew Modric, bringing the squad up to 22. So in the end, they might just sign either a left-back or a center-back.\n\nHopefully after the Club World Cup, we sign both a left-back and a center-back, bringing the squad total to 24.\n\n**What I Want:**\n\n* I do want to see Alaba and Mendy leave and Modric to renew one last time. \n* I also want Endrick to go out on loan.\n* Ideally, I\u2019d like us to sign:\n   * A left-back\n   * A center-back\n   * A playmaker like Kroos\n   * A forward like Joselu.\n\nso with Endrick on loan and adding 4 players we will have 25 players squad. The management need to do this as we are injury prone. also if any player outside Mandy and Alaba leaves like Lunin we should replace them accordingly.    \nWhat do you think the club will do? And what do *you* want to see happen?",
