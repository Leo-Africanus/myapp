        "content": "People are genuinely angry that he decided to show the 15 titles and told them to go home. What do you want him to do ? Cry or be ashamed? Gtfo with this he didn't play well and missed a penalty card. By that logic if you get lucky in your miserable life you're not allowed to celebrate because oh \"you didn't do well today \". I know who made my day every year for the last 3 years. Those screamers against sevilla man city that goal in the semis in the finals. Here's a man broken and hungry. I'll not turn on vini. Even if we went out last night, because this club is best represented not when we win but when we lose. I love all the players for having the balls to do shithousery at the same stadium which supported racist chants, threatened vini to never dance and gets teased by for not winning the \"balon'dor\". Our fanbase is used to success which I do not complain it is a thing of honour, but these fans are pampered. Let me tell you something very clear. Before we started winning these cl's from 2014-2024... We had won 3 in some last 50 years. Let that sink in for a moment. This guy gave us 2 of the greatest nights. I love you exactly for who you are vini. Never change but always get better \u2665\ufe0f",

If this rules is \"unfair\" &amp; \"doesnt make any sense\" Why never try to change it before atl vs real match? Is it really unfair? Or is it because the rules benefit real madrid? I'm 100% sure if Real Madrid player do double touch &amp; the goal get dissalowed, people would agree &amp; praise the ref. Sorry if my english is bad but i'm just trying to point out the MAD BIAS from these so called \"Pure &amp; Kind hearted\" Fanbase that would not stop talking about alvarez penalty. What about the handmall from simeone? The foul on rodrygo from 1st leg? Bomboclat! ",
