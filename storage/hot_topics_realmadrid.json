        "content": "\nWanted to hear everyone\u2019s thoughts on Franco Mastantuono. The kid looks like a real gem \u2014 technically gifted, left-footed, and mainly a CAM, but he\u2019s also shown he can be very effective on the right wing.\n\nJust a few days ago, reports came out that he was interested in joining Madrid, and with Xabi now officially in charge, I thought there might be a move. But instead, PSG are leading the race and we don't seem to be showing much intent.\n\nI know his profile isn\u2019t an urgent need for us at the moment. But let\u2019s be honest \u2014 our squad lacks a natural left-footed RW, and while Arda is an exciting talent, his best version shows up more centrally. Franco could fill that gap in a different way.\n\nHe may not be a necessity right now, but with the right development, he could become a very valuable asset in the future. Especially considering our recent pattern of chasing LWs and overlooking players like Nico, going for someone like Franco could be a smart investment.\n\nOne thing I always feel bad about is how things turned out with Isco \u2014 and this kid slightly reminds me of him. That mix of flair, vision, and calmness at such a young age is rare.\n\nIf If PSG get him, he\u2019s likely gone for 5\u20136 years \u2014 and we\u2019ll be watching him shine in the wrong shirt.\n\n\nHala Madrid!",

        "content": "I'm 100% a believer that Carvajal remains a solid option in our backline, and I believe he can return fit and strong after the injury, but I've started to wonder what his role will be in Xabi's lineup when he gets back.\n\nWith Trent now in the team as a solid RB, and probably Alvaro Carreras on the left as a solid option after Mendy (Mendy will still most likely be a starter), I think Carvajal's only option to be included is as a center-back. There we have Rudiger, and maybe Huijsen getting more action too, considering Militao's injuries. So I really don't see too much space for Carvajal anymore. Especially if Xabi decides to go for his 3-4-3 lineup. What do you guys think?",
