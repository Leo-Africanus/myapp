        "content": "Yes, Ronaldo and Messi are still scoring goals and contributing. Ibrahimovic was scoring until the age of 41. Totti, Benzema, and Lewandowski are (or were recently) still performing at a high level\u2026 and there are others as well.\n\nBut none of them provide even 25% of the physical effort that Luka Modric delivers, especially considering he\u2019s playing in Serie A, not in Saudi Arabia or the United States.\n\nAnyone who watches AC Milan\u2019s matches would never believe this man is 40 years old. He runs for 90 minutes without slowing down, fulfills his defensive duties perfectly, and contributes offensively as well. Allegri rarely substitutes him, he plays almost every match. And even during international breaks he never truly rests, and always there for his national team.\n\nSome defenders and goalkeepers have managed to shine at an older age, but I honestly can\u2019t remember a midfielder \u2014 arguably the most physically demanding position \u2014 performing at this level at this age.\n\nMany people say that Luka Modric only began to shine at a late age, but that simply isn\u2019t true. He didn\u2019t take any shortcuts. He didn\u2019t come through the academy of Real Madrid or Barcelona \u2014 he had to take the long road.\n\nHe was named the best player in the Bosnian league, the Croatian league, stood out at Tottenham Hotspur, was the best in his position for years at Real Madrid, and has been Croatia\u2019s main star for nearly 20 years.\n\nOne of the greatest players in football history, and in my opinion, the player with the greatest longevity \u2014 without any real competition.",

Who they picked up in this last window. Understand that I'm not saying that RMCF should've bought him but I say this to highlight the refusal of this club to go into the winter market especially to strengthen the current team, which is so weak in key area's of the pitch, from injuries or just a lack of the right player profile. \n\nThey are excellent players out there that the club refused to take advantage of &amp; at least try to attain. I.e, Marc Guehi for example, given the team's current woes at CB. I'm not going to list off players for every position in which the club lacks here but just highlight that City have gotten stronger &amp; so has ATM by taking needed action to make their teams better in area's where they needed to but this club RMCF refuses to do the same, we always here about how much revenue the club generates yearly and yet somehow it seems their only policy at the moment is free contracts to players at the end of theirs. Yet splashed out over 50+ mil on an unproven kid in Mastantuno?  Make it make sense.\n\nLook at Lookman's performance today &amp; to be frank he's fit them hand in glove. He will also terrorize us when we meet, another threat to deal with &amp; how does the club respond? Does anyone know of anyone the club is actually interested in besides random links from websites/journalist looking for traffic?\n\nClubs around us continue to strengthen &amp; RMCF looks like they're just twiddling their thumbs.\n\nMaybe I'm out of the know, feel free to enlighten me here but watching that guy make ATM stronger &amp; which performances he's had from the get go annoys the hell out of me because RMCF still look a shambles, heck ATM at this point plays better football than us &amp; never before could I even fathom such a sentence.  \n\n",

I've seen so much disrespect to him and so much talk about how catastrophic and ridiculous of a defeat this was in this sub. If the information is true, I guess all those people will change their minds, because it sounds really good to me.\n\nWe will see more in the coming days after they formalize the agreement and the lawsuit is withdrawn. In any case, in my opinion, if someone deserves the credit and trust not to throw him to the wolves before we know the details, that's Florentino P\u00e9rez.",

There is a shift from the big oil clubs to try and maintain their reign at the top, but also grow their league with other leagues taking lots of talent. This means limits will be put in place to prevent an over saturation of big money owners and ensuring a more fair competition. The current tv rights system is also very negative and generates a huge loss for the overall system with the advantage in the small individuals who benefit from the current system. An international free stream system would allow more fans to watch the games and which is exactly what advertisers want and they'll be willing to spend big. Instead of paying ridiculous fees, you'll watch free but you'll be the product(fine by me, just keep the 15 min halftime ad break and we're good). Overall, lots of drama, but this is the result we would gladly accept if the AS article information is true. ",
