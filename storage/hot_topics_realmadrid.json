Not only has he been resilient defensively, he's shown that he ia able to move the ball forward which is necessary in today's football. I hope that Alaba/Militao/Tchou coming back won't push him to the bench because he has shown that he deserves a chance. I also hope this motivates the coaching staff to be more open to trying talents from the younger team, the squad has been ravaged by injuries so this is the time to take a chance on these guys.",

He is still a super sub that I want to see but he is still young. \n\nHe and Arda are the ones that need time and patience, not Mbapp\u00e9.\n\nBut just wanted to call out whoever 'fan' and tactical genius and manager hiding behind their keyboard typing \"Endrick should have started\" now that Arda Guler started. Now watch Ancelotti start both of them and it will become \"Why is Brahim Diaz benched for these 2 kids\"",

        "title": "Biggest fumble of the decade to not get Kane or Haaland instead of Mbappe. Flo has a lot to answer for only choosing Mbappe.",
        "content": "The situation I am describing highlights one of the potential pitfalls of investing heavily in a single player like Mbapp\u00e9. While his talent is undeniable, football is a team sport, and a player\u2019s work ethic and tactical fit often matter as much as their individual brilliance. If Mbapp\u00e9 isn\u2019t pulling his weight defensively or contributing to the team\u2019s pressing game, it puts a massive burden on his teammates, especially in high-stakes matches where defensive organization is critical.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that his performances are suffering from a lack of adaptation to the team\u2019s tactical setup. Some players thrive when their team is built around them, but others struggle when they\u2019re required to fit into a pre-existing system. If Mbapp\u00e9 isn\u2019t delivering consistently\u2014whether due to effort, a mismatch in tactical expectations, or issues with team chemistry\u2014it makes the heavy investment in him seem less justifiable, especially if the club sacrificed depth or other key areas to fund his arrival.\n\nAs for his lack of clinical finishing, that\u2019s a concern for any top-tier striker. It\u2019s not just about the goals he scores but also the chances he creates or misses that could turn the tide of a game. Players like Erling Haaland and Robert Lewandowski, for example, are often praised for their ability to stay involved in the game even when their team struggles to dominate. Mbapp\u00e9, on the other hand, risks falling into the trap of becoming a passenger when things aren\u2019t going well.\n\nIt\u2019s still early, as I mentioned, and players do need time to settle into new clubs and systems. However, fans and analysts will naturally expect a player of Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s caliber and cost to make an immediate and consistent impact. If he continues to struggle, the pressure will only intensify, and the decision to build a team around him might start to look like a gamble that didn\u2019t pay off.",
