After a challenge, she lets the card stand \n\n\u26bd 45'+3 - GOLLLLL DEL CASTILLA, golazo de Palacios! - the ball is played out to the left wing, then back inside - Cestero lays it off to Palacios with a single touch, and he shoots first time and curls it perfectly into the top right corner from just inside the box \n\nHT - a very uneventful first half with both teams struggling to create danger, Osasuna struggling with terrible form and Castilla still insecure with their new coach ends with two bangs, as Osasuna needlessly get a player sent off and Castilla score a great goal to get themselves perfectly on track for the second half \n\n46' - second half underway\n\n\u26bd 51' - Goal for Osasuna - unbelievable mistake by Valde, who doesn't get the pass off in time and gets the ball stolen in our half - Arroyo takes it and converts the 1v1 with Fran\n\n65' - incredible miss again by Manuel \u00c1ngel, whose shooting has been absolutely awful today - he's completely open after a great play by the team at the left side of the box, but he puts it wide from a good position with the outside of his boot \n\n\ud83d\udd04 68' - Arnu, on loan from Valladolid, makes his Castilla debut, coming on for Loren\n\n\ud83d\udd04 74' - Mesonero and Leiva on for Manuel \u00c1ngel and Thiago Pitarch \n\n\ud83d\udd04 89' - Y\u00e1\u00f1ez and Palacios off for Pol Fortuny and Bruno Iglesias \n\nFT - an absolute embarrassment of a performance, letting the win slip away against 19th placed Osasuna who haven't won a match in months, playing against 10 men for more than an entire half. Bad start into Julian L\u00f3pez' era with 2 points out of a possible 9 and the team portraying a very bad image  today - the team can drop to as low as 9th place this matchday \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 19:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee**: Eugenia Gil Soriano \n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 1, Matchday 22\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[LaLiga+](https://www.laligaplus.laliga.com/) (subscription - 14.99\u20ac/month) (only available in Spain)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-3-3): Fran Gonz\u00e1lez - Diego Aguado, V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as \u2018Valde\u2019, Mario Rivas, David Jim\u00e9nez - Jorge Cestero, Manuel \u00c1ngel (74' Dani Mesonero), Thiago Pitarch (74' \u00c1lvaro Leiva) - C\u00e9sar Palacios (89' Bruno Iglesias), Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga (68' Adri\u00e1n Arnuncio 'Arnu'), Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (89' Pol Fortuny) \n\nBench: Sergio Mestre (GK), Guille S\u00fanico (GK), Jes\u00fas Fortea, Lamini Fati, Cristian David. \n\nUnavailable: Joan Mart\u00ednez (first team call-up), Manu Serrano (injury), Roberto Mart\u00edn (injury), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Rachad Fettal (injury). \n\nCoach: Juli\u00e1n L\u00f3pez de Lerma\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** LWLDL\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 7th | 32pt | 10-2-9 | 28:30\n",

Kr\u00f3l trained in Castilla while the other two went to Real Madrid C.\nKr\u00f3l was a left back, he admired Roberto Carlos and he played U19 National team.\nGlik was a center back and he was bought from Union Deportivo Horadada where he made a good impression on Real Madrid squad. He had the best career out of these 3 and was a solid defender.\nMatuszek was a CDM and he was considered the most talented and came from a club called Pilar de la Horadada.\n\n",

I saw a tweet bashing him for being at a party shortly after the Benfica loss. And this wasn\u2019t just some small tweet, it had about a million or so views and counting. Quotes full of people mocking/ridiculing him. All that just for the picture used in the tweet to be a picture from 2024\u2026 This is the news our fanbase is consuming (and believing) day in and day out.\n\nAnd don\u2019t let it be a player who\u2019s currently disliked (such as Vini). When people who already don\u2019t like a player see negative news about said player, all critical thinking goes out the window. That post affirms their bias so they\u2019re not about to go fact checking or commit real thinking on it. Textbook confirmation bias. If it\u2019s drama you want, there\u2019s plenty of reality TV out there for you, but I guess it doesn\u2019t quite scratch the itch of spreading false narratives of a player on a team you love and support.",

        "title": "\u201cWe can\u2019t always be winning\u201d, but where are the changes to show that Madrid management cares?",
        "content": "No matter how the fans justify the current condition of Madrid, especially with the thesis that \u201cwe can\u2019t always win\u201d or \u201ceveryone goes through crisis\u201d, this is such an understatement and distortion of what\u2019s happening at the club. Yeah, we can\u2019t always win, but where are the changes to improve or to consider something a change???? Do you not understand that the president spent more than a hundred mil for players whom we consider a \u201cfuture perspective\u201d, but not for players who could bring changes now? Like someone who is a lot more experienced, so we could close the midfield and the players who play 70 matches a season and then get injured for the upcoming future. \n\nAgain, this isn\u2019t about bitching Perez or always complaining. It\u2019s about the club. The emblem. Y\u2019all understand that we are considered to be a historic team and the best team worldwide (according to the trophies and the whole \u201c3ucls in a row\u201d narrative). It\u2019s unacceptable for the fans of the club to constantly bring down the status of Madrid to a state, where we would be bragging about 6:1 against Monaco. We are bigger than that.\n\nGoing to back to the first paragraph, there were rumours (rather news from certain article) that Madrid is in a brink of bankruptcy, but why is Perez making such \u201cbig purchases\u201d for the so called \u201cfuture talents\u201d? Again, I don\u2019t believe on these news, but makes me think. Perez has a network of propaganda (el chiringuito, RMTV,etc) who deliver what the Madrid bureaucracy thinks in a moment. If you notice, no pressure on Alaba, Rudiger, and others, who are keen to be injured, but earn almost 20 mil a year. Why aren\u2019t there news about Perez pushing those players out by mutual contract termination?\n\nThe logic of this might just lie on Perez being a corporate leader while players are the product. We can\u2019t accept this kind of shift from a sport team, to a corporate clergy",

        "content": "  I quite honestly don\u2019t understand why we keep focusing so much on 433. A formation that is heavily reliant on width and the wings. The whole point of the formation is for the winger to create chances by either beating the defenders or crossing the ball. Guess what? Our wingers are not exceptionally good at that. We do not have a tall striker who gets in the box to receive crosses, and our wingers have been underperforming. Our right flank is basically nonexistent except for when Rodrygo decides to play good. If our wings are so weak, why not drop the same formation that has not led us anywhere. I am not claiming it is the solution, but playing the diamond again would be great. You put Bellingham behind the strikers so he can thrive again. We would also have more control in midfield and fullbacks could go higher up the pitch. Maybe this is not the best, but 433 is definitely not the way. ",
