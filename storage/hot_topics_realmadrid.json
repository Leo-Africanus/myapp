He\u2019s not listed in the guide but personally Tier 2.\n\n&gt; The player\u2019s [Vini\u2019s] entourage has felt supported by the club through recent months, while Madrid sources pointed out to The Athletic that the club had not fined him for his angry reaction to being substituted in October\u2019s Clasico at the Bernabeu. Conversely, multiple sources have said that the club has been concerned at times about Vinicius Jr becoming distracted by off-pitch issues, affecting his performance in the team.\n\nI also criticized Xabi for being weak and not asserting his authority by benching Vini after the El Clasico tantrum. Didn\u2019t come to mind that he was probably just following suit given the club\u2019s stance.",

        "content": "This isn't \"rage-after-a-draw\" talk or some reactionary street language. This is literally what Spanish journalists have been saying nonstop over the past hours. What's happening at Real Madrid is a full-on administrative disaster. Yes the chaos on the pitch and the disgusting behavior in midfield is 100% the board's fault. No debate.\n\nXabi Alonso is a very good coach, at least against small and medium teams. He started the season destroying them without mercy, which is exactly how you win a league comfortably. He showed personality, he didn\u2019t care if he benched Bellingham or Vinicius , everyone saw it in the Club World Cup and the early weeks of the season.\n\nThen suddenly everything flipped the moment some of the \"holy cows\" in the locker room started acting up.\nYep  the board stepped in and basically told Xabi not to be too harsh on certain players. Or in other words: \"Find a middle ground between you and the players.\"\nThat might work in some random street caf\u00e9 not in a football club.\n\nThis isn't even a defense of Xabi. He made mistakes, sure. But let's ask the million-dollar question:\n\n**Does the coach have complete freedom**?\nOf course not. Not even close. It's impossible for him to make any decision freely because if one of the \"holy cows\" drops in form, their market value drops with them  and the board can't have that.\n\nThese deadweight names aren't going to succeed. These lost players won't give you anything. They failed under the smiling  coach, and they failed under the strict and demanding one. They're rotting pieces that will drag down the whole club unless the board steps in.\n",

He was only subbed for one game this season with a total of like 12 minutes.\n\nHe was a real bright spark in the Copa del Rey last season, and every time he played, he looked like a genuine goal threat.\n\nHe scored a goal every 121 minutes last season, despite mostly coming on as a late substitute in la liga. He was the top scorer in the Copa del Rey and produced some really nice goals.\n\nI agree that his overall game still needs improvement, but he brings that goal threat which most of our attackers except Mbapp\u00e9 (and to some extent Gonzalo Garc\u00eda) are lacking right now.\n\nYoung talent do not want to come to Madrid if they risk rotting on the bench for no reason.   \n",

        "content": "Hi all, we're in the Netherlands and we're planning to go to Madrid for a long weekend when we play against Athletic club. I'd love to get tickets to the game to go with my son who's 8 and a huge fan. \n\nI'm a bit concerned about ticket availability from searching and reading on this sub. I understand tickets will be available about a week before the game, but I take it it's not really worth it getting the Madridistas premium pack right? Do I have a chance to buy tickets on the official website or is everything scooped up by 3rd party resellers? \n\nThanks for your advice, Hala Madrid! ",

        "content": "During the CWC, he was praising Gonzalo Garcia but Gonzalo only gets brought in at the 89th minute. Benching Vini when he's having a bad game is great but Mbapp\u00e9 plays the whole game even if he's not having a good game. Gonzalo and Endrick must feel pretty discouraged right now. There's even a fake AI picture of Endrick crying during the Girona game, that's how he must feeling inside. Xabi has went back on all of his promises since the start of the season. So many questionable decisions from Xabi",
