Overall, the lead is deserved however \n\n46' - 2nd half underway \n\n\u26bd 56' - GOLLLL DEL CASTILLA - fast attack with lots of space for Pol Fortuny - Gonzalo makes the run into the box and Pol puts an easy pass into his run, Gonzalo's first touch is perfect, and he finishes softly with the inside of his boot against the far post and into the net! \n\n\u26bd 58' - goal for Marbella right after the kick off - and it's our former player Jos\u00e9 Callej\u00f3n who scores, just like in the first match. He initiates the attack himself, dribbling past our midfield and playing it out wide - his teammate lays it off to him in the box with the back of his heel, and he comes running at the ball full speed to finish it past Fran \n\n60' - massive chance to immediately restore the 2-goal lead, another top cross from Yusi from the left to the far post, where Pol Fortuny broke free of his marker but sadly has to finish on the volley with this weak foot, and he puts it just wide of the far post \n\n\u26bd 65' - GOLLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - Marbella take risks and leave lots of space for us to counter - Ribes recovers the ball at the edge of our box, plays it to Chema, who launches a perfect long ball to Victor Mu\u00f1oz - who once again escapes his opponents, and squares it perfecrly to Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, he pokes it past the keeper with the tip of his boot for the 3-1! \n\n70' - Gonzalo hits the post, what a play by him! - he is through on the left side in a 2v3 counter, he takes on the fullback and turns past him with a quick change of direction, then he leaves another opponent behind in the same manner, his finish is almost perfect, but it hits the post, runs across the goal line and goes out for a goal kick on the other side \n\n\ud83d\udd04 74' - triple sub, Yusi, Chema and Z\u00fa\u00f1iga off for Valde, Antonio David and Campos\n\n80' - big chance for V\u00edctor to seal the match, Pol Fortuny releases a through ball for him to chase, and once again he launches like a rocket and outruns the defender by a bit margin, but he fails to put his finish on target with only the keeper to bear\n\n\ud83d\udd04 81' - C\u00e9sar Palacios is back from his ACL tear after 9 months! He comes on for Pol Fortuny. \n\n\ud83d\udd04 90' - last sub, Borja for V\u00edctor \n\n\u26bd 90'+2 - goal for Marbella, golazo by Soto - a bit out of nowhere, he cuts inside from the right wing and blasts an absolute missile out with his left foot, it hits the net in the top left corner \n\n90'+4 - good chance for Marbella for the late equaliser, Ribes fails to clear a ball in our box and the Marbella player fires the rebound over the bar \n\nFT - victory that became unnecessarily tight in the end, with Castilla wasting chances on the counter and Marbella getting a lifeline in added time with a great goal. The team keeps the possibilities of reaching the playoffs alive with this win, but it will still be very difficult, 4 points behind the last playoff spots with only 3 matches to go \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 18:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee**: \u00c1lvaro C\u00e1novas Garc\u00eda-Villarrubia\n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 2, Matchday 35\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[FEF TV](https://feftv.com) (subscription - 12.99\u20ac/month)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (5-2-3): Fran Gonz\u00e1lez - Youssef Enr\u00edquez \u2018Yusi\u2019 (74' V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as 'Valde'), Edgar Pujol, Mario Rivas, Quique Ribes, David Jim\u00e9nez - Jos\u00e9 Maria Andr\u00e9s \u2018Chema\u2019 (74' Antonio David), Pol Fortuny (81' C\u00e9sar Palacios) - Gonzalo Garc\u00eda, Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga (74' Andr\u00e9s Campos), V\u00edctor Mu\u00f1oz (90' Borja Alonso) \n\nBench: Mario de Luis (GK), Diego Pi\u00f1eiro (GK), Lorenzo Aguado, David Ruiz, Babacar Diocou. \n\nUnavailable: Ra\u00fal Asencio (first team call-up), Jacobo Ram\u00f3n (first team call-up), David Cuenca (pubalgia), Manuel \u00c1ngel (?), Jeremy de Le\u00f3n (shoulder injury). \n\nCoach: Ra\u00fal\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** DDDWL\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 10th | 46pt | 10-16-8 | 51:34\n",

I know they both play in different positions and mbappe also takes penalties but its still a shocking stats because rodrygo has played 5 more seasons than mbappe.\n\nPlus there are no excuses for the last season because rodrygo was freely allowed to play forward without much defensive duties yet he was not able to cross sergio ramos's highest goal talley in a la liga season of 11 goals. It's just very shocking to me\n\n",

        "content": "I love Carlo. he's 100% the best manager we've ever had and he's at worst top 3 best managers ever, for me he is, but I could see the argument for Ferguson or Guardiola being top 1-3 as well.\n\nHaving said that, he's just too stubborn when things clearly are not going well. My man played Arda like 1 La liga match, then threw him to the sharks against Liverpool, one of the thoughest matches on the season and then vanished him to the shadow realm. \n\nThen today, he takes him out when Vini was having a horrible match, yet Arda was subbed...ok. He also subbed Ra\u00fal when Tchouameni is one yellow card away from not being able to play the next match... ok. \n\nI've seen so much hate towards Tcho and Lucas, but how can a player perform when they are played out of their position so much? Tchou shows his worth when he's played at the midfield and to me, not renewing Lucas is a mistake. He's huge on the locker room, he's cold af on penalties, which is very relevant. But sure, we'll crucify him cause he's a right winger being played as an RB pretty much the whole season.\n\nSure Florentino is at fault the most here, the team has been poorly planned and we're lucky that Carvajal didn't get another serious injury in the last 3-4 years, that we had Nacho, who could have been a starter for 99% of teams in Europe.\n\nYet, with all this, Carlo is definitely not making the best choices with the players he had. Why play Tchou as a CB for like half of the season when Ra\u00fal was there? Why insist on Lucas at RB, when Fede is clearly better and he had some kids he could have at least tried? It sucks to lose Fede at the midfield, but I'm sure it sucks more to keep getting scorched on Lucas' side every match.\n\nWhy banish Arda to the shadow realm after the Euros he had, just cause of 2 bad matches? Why is Endrick still playing basically no minutes? If you don't plan to really use them anyways, why not loan them so they can get minutes develop and come back next season as better players? I love Carlo, but he's too set on his old ways and yes, that has worked for us before, but it clearly doesn't anymore.",

        "content": "I am seeing a lot of people that compare Arda to Kroos here due to his playmaking abilities, and even though I think that Arda could do well in that role, I think that it'd would be a waste of his abilities in the final third. \n\nHe has crazy good shooting and crossing, and has the potential to hit crazy amounts of G/A when he develops into a starter(which could be sooner than expected). His ideal role is probably the play as a #8 and #10 hybrid like KDB, he can still help the build-up with his playmaking but his best quality is his goalscoring and chance creation ability as shown today. Also have to mention that Arda is #4 among most big chances created in LaLiga this season in this team with 9 big chances created, while Vini has 10 and Bellingham has only 4 despite playing a lot more.\n\nThe only problem is that Bellingham has been playing this role already, I wonder how a midfield would work if Bellingham played as a box-to-box with Arda getting more freedom in offense as a midfielder. Curious to see what Xabi is gonna do next season.",

Arda\u2019s is in very good form, as seen in yesterday Celta Vigo match. Bellingham is extremely versatile and should adapt well in midfield. Rodrygo\u2019s dribbling and agility make him a deadly threat in the attacking midfield (AMF) position. \n\nBellingham and Valverde will provide strong coverage in midfield, while the front four (Arda, Rodrygo, Vini, and Mbapp\u00e9) will have plenty of options.",
