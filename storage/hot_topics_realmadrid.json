When this was not accepted, the club asked the player\u2019s side to propose a figure.\n\nVinicius Jr\u2019s representatives requested a historic contract, in the region of the highest ever at the club (which was given to Cristiano Ronaldo), with a package of up to \u20ac30million per season.

And the funny thing is that the excuses fans now make for Rodrygo were never once brought up for Gareth Bale: \u201cOh, he\u2019s not playing in his preferred position\u2026 Oh, he\u2019s overshadowed because of Ronaldo and Benzema\u2026 Oh, he doesn\u2019t get special treatment like the other stars of the team.\u201d\n\nRodrygo will live long on the memory of what he did against Man City and Chelsea. But let\u2019s remember that this man (Bale) contributed with goals in three Champions League finals and yet never received even a fraction of the sympathy, media support, or fan backing that Rodrygo gets today.",

Not to say we have bad players, they are good but some of them are at best average at what they do without kroos, modric and benzema holding their hands. Look at some of the quality we lost since those three left: No Aerial threats, our set pieces have gone down the gutter, inconsistent forwards, midfield now lacks a technical player that isn't afraid of the ball, our defense is trash, our right side is completely dead without Carvajal, the bench is full of average players mixed in with young players who wont get chances to play (We have two strikers rotting on the bench) and most importantly we lost our mentality. The only reliable position we have is goalkeeping and thats because its courtois and we have a very good backup in lunin. The squad planning since the departure of Benzema has been questionable to say the least and those two ucl wins glossed over the issues which we are now facing. \n\nI know I'm going to get downvoted just because of what I said but at this point I don't really care. We have become an average team and unless these players start to play for the club and not themselves, we will remain average and no coach is going to fix this doesn't matter if its carlo, xabi or zidane.",

Second, seeing valverde out of all people decide to jog back and then eventually just stop moving is shocking. For example, if this was Barca, at least one of their midfielders would have been fighting for their lives getting back to help the defense, yet our captain that's only been on the field for 20 minutes just stops moving. I'm not trying to put the blame on him alone, my whole point is that the lack of effort from ALL of these players except for Guler, Jude, Asencio ( yes he gave them that 2nd goal but before that he was one of the only players that looked like he actually cared), and Gonzalo of course. This is another benefit of having academy players btw, because they fight like their lives depend on it. I rather see someone from the academy on the field instead of Ceballos for example, who wanted to leave a few months ago. Anyway, hopefully we see some positive changes in the future.",

        "content": "Growing up I've always felt RM had one of the most secure dressing room maybe along with Bayern. Very little controversies or media stories. Even during the Barca treble years there was absolutely reports of unrest. RM have always been one of the most media secure football clubs as far as I've known. But what's changed now?\n\nWe're literally top of the table. Have 2 defeats in the season till now with 2 draws. How is there so much unrest? How is Alonso's job at risk? We've got the best defence in the league &amp; 3rd best in UCL. Coming to Alonso. Is he making mistakes? Yes. Are some of his decisons highly questionable? 100%. But that's what you get with a manager with 2+1/2 seasons of senior management. HE WILL MAKE MISTAKES! THAT IS WHAT YOU GET WITH A YOUNG MANAGER.\n\nArteta took time. Kompany literally got relegated. You have to give him the headroom to learn from his mistakes instead of sack threats. Are we not allowed a transition? Are we not alloed a rebuild phase? Plus its a well known fact that we had an incomplete transfer window!\n\nComing to the dressing room. I feel so sad. Bunch of primadonnas. How have you had your head so up your arse as to not renew your contract cause the manager is rotating you? Its his job ffs! His job is create tactics &amp; win &amp; your job is to play the way he wants! These massive egos will ruin the club. I really believed these issues would never appear at RM.\n\nFreaking Cristiano was let go due to these issues. Who do these players think they are?           \n\nI miss Sergio Ramos in times like this. \n\nPS - I'm not defending Alonso but he's exactly what you're gonna get with a young manager. You have to accep his vision. ",

        "content": " [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qyqeeAALUM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qyqeeAALUM)\n\nJust watched a video with all of Benzema and Ronaldo assists to each other. It's like 23 minutes long, which just shows how insane their chemistry together was. Here are some things I noticed:\n\n\\- **Different types of goals:** Both Ronaldo and Benzema scored in so many different ways (longshot, header, tap-in, counterattack, tiki-taka, etc.). They were two very unpredictable attackers, opposite to our current attack.\n\n\\- **90% of the goals had nothing to do with the midfield:** There are so many dumbass people on this sub who complain that our midfield isn't creative enough. If you watch the entire video above, the majority of goals had nothing to do with the midfield. They were just genius link-up play between Ronaldo and Big Benz. A quick one-two, a low cross into the box, a lofted pass. Just two players who knew exactly how to play with each other. \n\n\\- **Benzema sacrificed so much for Ronaldo:** There were several moments in the video where Benzema could have easily scored, but still gave the goal to Ronaldo. He's truly one of the most unselfish superstars I've ever seen. Never cared about statpadding or getting the individual glory. Just focused on making the whole team better. \n\n\\- **Madrid will never find two attackers with such chemistry:** Mbappe might be more talented than Benzema, and Haaland might be just as clinical as Ronaldo, but even if those two played together for us, they would lack the chemistry that Ronaldo had with Big Benz. I'm glad I got to see them play when I was younger because I'll probably never see anything like it ever again. ",

        "content": "Be honest. I remember I was Team Higuain, he just looked more prolific and had helped us a lot during previous years including scoring a league-winning goal. It wasn\u2019t until the game vs Lyon that my opinion of him started to change and I realized that he didn\u2019t have that clutch gene that some forwards have. Of course, Benzema also had some terrible seasons early on his career, but his role in being the one who dropped back and linked with the midfield so that Ronaldo and Bale could score helped us a lot. I honestly didn\u2019t expect Benzema to become such a legendary player in hindsight but I\u2019m glad I was wrong. He became the player we all envisioned him becoming back during his Lyon days, where he was compared to a Ronaldo/Zidane hybrid. Higuain, I think, was never the same after the World Cup final where he choked. I still hold a soft spot for him tho, he was the least talented of the 3 (Gago and Marcelo were the other 2) but I think he carved out a decent career. I don\u2019t think he was a legend, but perhaps a cult hero. Funnily enough, Gago was the one many thought had the highest ceiling of the 3, but alas, injuries stopped him.",

        "content": "   I think at this point it has to be obvious that Mbappe is not a striker. So many people are so sure that Mbappe can play striker well and just has to learn. However, I think after so much, it is obvious he is not built for that. If you look at his way of playing, always shifts to the laterals of the pitch and plays deeper. If anything, he is more of a false 9, but without the playmaking qualities. I will keep saying it, we are wasting Mbappe by forcing him to play striker. Anyone who claims that he scores, yes he does, because he is Mbappe. Put him anywhere and he will deliver because he is world class, but that is not his best position for him or the team. The amount of times I see a beautiful play just for no one to be in the box is insane. For some reason Mbappe avoids the box as much as possible. I do not know how you would arrange the players after, but I would try Mbappe on the wing for at least one match. If you want to try stuff so much, then play your young prospects who are both strikers! Try playing Gonzalo on less important matches, play Mbappe on the wing for a couple matches, put Endrick, etc. I don\u2019t understand this fixedness on keeping Mbappe as a number nine. When we played the CWC we were doing pretty well because we had a proper 9. Unless we get one, we will keep doing bad. ",

        "content": "After watching the 2\u20132 draw vs Elche, it\u2019s pretty clear what Real Madrid is missing right now. The squad is elite, the talent is there, but the team looks disorganized and blunt in attack. Here are the three things Madrid actually needs:\n\n**1. A real striker**  \nMbapp\u00e9 is world-class, but he is not a pure 9. Every time he plays centrally, the team loses width and unpredictability. He\u2019s at his best when he starts wide on the left and attacks space. Madrid need a striker who stays in the box, finishes chances, and gives the team a reference point for crosses like Trents. Someone who can turn all those half-chances into goals.\n\n**2. Tactical stability**  \nXabi Alonso is experimenting way too much every game. It\u2019s making the team lose structure. Madrid needs a consistent system, a fixed midfield anchor, and a front line that actually fits together. When the team has stability, the quality improves a lot.\n\n**3. Focus and intensity**  \nConceding twice vs Elche came from switching off and losing duels. Madrid have now gone three games without a win, not because they\u2019re worse, but because the players couldn't care less. They need better concentration, and a sharper mentality which would fix half the problems.",

        "content": "Someone recently posted a graphic on this sub, which showed 5 players in the 23/24 season had 10+ goals (Jude, Vini, Rodrygo, Joselu, and motherfucking Brahim Diaz). \n\nLet's look at how our current attack is faring in the league as we near the end of the first half of the season: \n\n\\- Mbappe: 13 goals (hip hip hooray for the Mbappe fanboys)\n\n\\- Vini: 5 goals (surprised to see him in 2nd place given his inconsistent form)\n\n\\- Guler: 3 goals\n\n\\- Jude: 2 goals (lol, how the fuck is Jude 4th on the list when he pretty much just came back from surgery). \n\nThree other players have 1 goal each, and literally everyone else has a big fat ZERO, including Valverde, Camavinga, and Rodrygo. This begs the question: how the fuck did we go from being a well-balanced attack with 5 players bagging 10+ goals to basically Mbappe FC? Losing Kroos was a big blow, but there's no way one player's departure can lead to such a drastic difference in the attack. \n\nIt also raises another question, why the fuck can't our midfield and defense help out the attack? I'm not expecting prime Ramos numbers, but fuck me, this is dismal. \n\n",
