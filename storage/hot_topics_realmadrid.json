I just loved good football. All what mattered to me was goals. I knew what Zidane truly was when he was long gone. Guti introduced me to football tactics when I was old enough to start comprehending what was happening on the field. Then came Mdoric-Kroos-Casemiro era which gave us the 3-peat. Then I found my new admiration: Zinedeine Jude Bellingham. This man is tying together my first football passion with my present obession. It\u2019s not just this pass or that clutch; it\u2019s the combination of art display in the 6800 minutes I\u2019ve witnessed him present to us. We are lucky not only to be alive to be Madridistas but also to be alive at a time when all of his heritage is visually well documented to share with our children to ensure the Real Madrid linage continues on. \n\nHala Madrid \ud83d\udda4\ud83e\udd0d",
