        "title": "I'm so glad we never went for a \"traditional striker\" and we just trusted Mbappe for the role",
        "content": "Anyone who has supported this club at least long enough to have lived through the Mbappe transfer saga, knows that there were countless RM fans that wanted us to buy a natural 9 instead of \"playing a winger centrally\".\n\nThe truth is, that was never an option and Perez knew it. The current era barely has any consistently good strikers in the top leagues, there are very few of them:\n\n* Haaland is a generational player, for me the deserved 2023 Ballon d'Or winner, but he has a 9 year contract with the richest team in the world, he was never an option. \n* Kane is turning 33 at the end of the season. We had the chance to sign him for 100m when he was 30 and at the time it felt wrong that Perez never went for him, as he could have been a perfect KB9 replacement. But long-term was always a problem, not to mention that he's far less marketable than Mbappe.\n* Alvarez. Amazing player, still very young, Atletico would rather get relegated and burn their stadium than sell their best player to us.\n* One step below these guys I'd add Guirassy (29, reached his prime very recently, far less marketable than other options) and... Lewandowski (grandpa who plays for our rivals).\n\nIf you look at some recent CF signings, most of them have been underwhelming. Isak and Gyokeres have both been ass for club and country this season. And while I think Isak can bounce back, I don't really see anything special about Gyokeres as a player. Sesko also hasn't shown anything (yet?). Marmoush has been mediocre. Joao Pedro had a crazy start for his Chelsea career, now barely exists on the pitch. Kolo Muani costed 100m for nothing. Woltemade is also a mid striker who costed 80+. Moise Kean was awful in 2023/24, was amazing last season, now he seems to be back to awful. Retegui had a great season with Atalanta, now went to Saudi. Juventus bought David from Lille, does nothing as well. Osimhen was amazing at Napoli, but now plays in Turkey, I'm not sure about his level anymore, plus he's injury prone.\n\nAs you can see, in the current market there are three categories of strikers:\n\n1. A couple of world class players that we could never sign\n2. Overpriced and inconsistent mid players (excluding Isak who might not be mid)\n3. Harry Kane, who we could have bought at one point, but now that ship has sailed\n\nIn hindsight, the club's decision to not chase after a number 9 and only focus on Mbappe proves to be spot on. Not only because Mbappe has been amazing, but because every other realistic option we could have signed doesn't impress anywhere. People here genuinely wanted us to spend 90+ and get Kolo Muani as a striker, the guy who is... a back-up winger at Spurs nowadays.\n\nThis generation lacks good strikers and good teams/managers knew it. It's no coincidence PSG won the UCL with Dembele in 2025, while we won it with a winger duo and Jude making runs in the box a year ago. \n\n",

Even adding the signing bonuses of the free agents, we spent about 900M\u20ac to build this squad, so creating a 50% value. \n\nThis is significantly better than Manchester City or Arsenal, who complete the podium, that struggle to barely keep the value of the squad they assembled\n",

This one though, is unique in that Pe\u00f1arol managed to become club world champs at the Santiago Bernabeu, which is still an unprecedented feat. ",
