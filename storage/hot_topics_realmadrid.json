But one name that should also stand out with these others is Fran Garcia.\n\nI was personally super disappointed with his performances last season but although it is still too early to judge, I just wanted to take a moment to highlight what a beast Fran Garcia is turning into under Alonso. Provides attacking cover, runs into spaces so Huijsen can find him, links up with midfield, vini and Huijsen in a seamless manner and it seems his overall game play has just been elevated. He is already playing like what we were hoping Carreras would play like. \n\nGame 1: Arguably our best player on the pitch.\n\nGame 2 : Assist \n\nGame 3: Vital interception that led to the first goal\n\nHope he continues this, even if Carreras does come in, a healthy competition for both rising stars would be really good for the team as well as both of their personal development.",

        "content": "Seeing the first 3 matches of the CWC, I think he has the potential of a first team player. But for now, a substitute for Mbappe maybe. Definitely has put pressure on Mbappe for his position in the team.\n\nThe good parts:\n- Good with first touches. \n- Creative with passing in the final third. \n- Does drop deep to support the midfield when out of possession. \n\nPossible improvements:\n- Needs a decent chunk of game time to get polished, especially the finishing bit under pressure/in tight spaces. \n\nSaid before, he's the right replacement for someone like Joselu, sort of a BETA CF. \n\nMy ratings\n\nTouch: 8/10\nPositioning: 7.5/10\nCreativity: 8/10\nFinishing: 7/10",

They did not play that bad during this cwc so they seem a hard opponent ",
