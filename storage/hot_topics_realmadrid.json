Like this is the number 7 for real madrid were talking about here. Those were average games at best. Nothing special and I won\u2018t be convinced otherwise. He did a successful step over against Juve and everyone celebrated it like it wasn\u2019t a completely normal thing for him a year ago. He\u2018s literally been playing like garnacho or fkn sterling. His touch is terrible, he makes too many mistakes and he literally can\u2018t beat his man on anymore?? I know I will get flamed for this and it hurts me to say this but it\u2019s true, he\u2019s not even top 10 wingers in the world.He\u2018s pressing a bit more and making simple passes now and is getting celebrated for it man like what are we doing. Give rodrygo a chance at lw and I promise he\u2018s going to be better or atleast on the same level. 100%. Vini looks like he\u2018s gained some muscle mass, he doesn\u2018t look as quick as he used to and its affecting heavily. Whatever, I dont think we should condone his bad performances any longer",

        "content": "I really like the way we\u2019ve played in the last two games (besides that lapse of concentration the last 10 minutes yesterday). Having Tchouameni gives us the flexibility to play a 3-5-2 with the ball and a 5-3-2 when defending. My issue is, who replaces Tchouameni if he gets an injury. I don\u2019t think we have a player that can transition from CB to CDM and back besides him and Alaba (way past his prime). I really think we need another center back with good ball retention that can adapt to CDM if needed. \n\nWhat do you guys think?",
