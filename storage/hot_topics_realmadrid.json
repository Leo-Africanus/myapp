        "content": "A Bar\u00e7a fan coming in peace asking a question for Madrid fans\n\nI was watching the last match vs Alav\u00e9s and noticed something about Flick. Even after winning, he looked kind of sad or distant on the bench. I\u2019ve also seen similar moments with Xabi Alonso rarely smiling, always looking tense.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m overthinking it, but it really made me realise how insanely difficult it must be to manage clubs like Real Madrid and Barcelona. The pressure is constant. Even Pep left Bar\u00e7a after so much success, and Zidane walked away after the three-peat. There are many other examples too.\n\nSo my question to Madrid fans:\nDo you also feel that managing these clubs drains coaches emotionally, even when the results are good?\nWould love to hear your thoughts.",

He was never a perfect player, but his nonstop energy, vertical runs, and aggressive work rate on the right side gave the team a crucial extra dimension. With him, opponents had to respect that flank, stretching defenses and creating space for Vini and Mbapp\u00e9 to exploit. Without him, the entire right wing has gone dead, letting teams overload the left and simply lock onto our two superstars. The attack becomes predictable, the buildup stalls, and Madrid loses the balance and unpredictability that Franco\u2019s presence naturally provided.",
