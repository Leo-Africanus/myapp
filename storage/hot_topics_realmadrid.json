Just look at other teams that are having a worst season than us, Liverpool literally won the league last season and now they have lost 6 games in a row and are out of the title race and yet I don't hear any slot out, sell this player and sell that player nonsense. \n\nWe only lost two games and drawn one so far this season but the way this fanbase is acting you would think we are in relegation. Everything seems blown out way of proportion and all its doing is feeding into the tabloids/medias hands to create a narrative about how the locker room is in disarray and all those clips in the Rayo game is just proving my point. Just wait until after the international break when we start to win games again how all these \"issues\" just vanish and all the xabi out and player fc hating fans go quiet, it happened after we lost to Atletico Madrid and we bounced back just fine. \n\nlosing to Liverpool in the champions league is not the end of the world as we are still in the top 8, all we need to do is learn from our mistakes and move on. We are so much better than last season, and yet still finding our new identity, its not perfect but we are heading in the right direction.",

Both Diaz and Rodrygo proved they are not good starters on the right.\n\nWith TAA back, we can use Valverde as Right midfielder again, but TAA isn't some typical full back who just run into space and cross, we need to change the system if we want to use him well.\n\nEndrick certainly can bring some good attack since he can run, dribble and charge into the box. It's just he needs to learn more about pass combination/run back to help defense. I do think he deserves more chances compare to Rodrygo on the right.",

He hasn't performed for a very long time now. \n\nPeople demanded for Guler to start. He plays well against low blocks but is a liability in the big matches and in matches with high tempo or physical play. \n\nCamavinga is/was talked about like the solution to our issues in the midfield. But he hasn't shown it, he's very inconsistent. More bad performances than good, and he's injured too often. \n\nNow it's Endrick. He's the answer to all the problems according to users here. The fact is that he has shown that he is very raw and has been injured for a while. \n\nIt makes me wonder why this is. Why do the users here think that certain individuals will fix everything? \n\nIs this place filled with very young users? Is it years of the club relying on individuals to win us titles that has lead to this discourse?",

        "title": "Much different team now. The aerial game is no longer an option with this starting squad/current system, yet hope isn't lost. Before and after for those unaware of the difference. 3rd image is my opinion of what should change.",
        "content": "This is a basic comparison. When breaking down teams in a low block our old team was almost perfect. Which is why we would have often 4+ goal scorelines. It was a solid structure that allow a bombardment of crosses and insurance to stop the counter. \n\nNow we only have Jude as a threat in the box, but very fast and technical players with Valverde in midifeld and Mbappe and Vini. We can no longer lean on the aerial attack, but in the building department of Benzema holding the ball and playing it through to Ronaldo and Bale stays the same. Jude will fill that role and provide that outlet to Mbappe and Vini. \n\nVini now with an actual crossing option will have to be defended more closely giving him more opportunities to be dangerous. Going down the line to cross to Jude, cutback to arda/Valverde, or to use the space in between to go for himself. The same applies to Mbappe who actually is much more efficient when shooting across goal on the right like his most recent el cl\u00e1sico goal. If Vini and Mbappe swap wings, they most certainly will create a headache for defenders. \n\nAnd when we are in dire need of a goal, that switch of Arda for Gonzalo and pairing Gonzalo and Jude in the box will work wonders. \n\nWe no longer are an aerial based team, but we have the components to spread the field and be dangerous. Xabi needs to experiment more until we have a proper structure in attack. I appreciate his usage of Masantouno/Brahim, but we have Mbappe we will perform a much better job in creating danger on that right side and Jude we will perform an even better job in being strong and protecting/blocking out the centerbacks creating space for the team to score. Lemme know what y'all think. ",

        "title": "At this point of the season, the last time we had brought a new coach: 3D, 1L in La Liga + a home loss to some team from Moldova",
        "content": "I think that interchanging between Ancelotti-Zidane for a decade, with small breaks inbetween, has made people forget how it's like to appoint a completely NEW manager, who hasn't managed the team again or wasn't an assistant manager previously.\n\nWhen Ancelotti was brought in 2021, at that point of the season we had dropped points in 4 La Liga games in 12, not 2/12. We also lost 1-2 to Sheriff Tiraspol at home, one of the most shocking results in the history of the competition. We barely managed to get a 3-3 draw at home vs Levante, with Vini scoring in the 85th minute. We barely won 2-1 vs Valencia, with two goals after the 85th minute again. Of course, none of it mattered in the end, because we won the league and the UCL.\n\nWhen Zidane had his first full season on his 2nd tenure (19/20), we had 4D, 1L in 12 league games, even worse than 21/22 and we hadn't even faced Barcelona. In the UCL we got completely destroyed by PSG (3-0) and then drew 2-2 at home vs Club Brugge. We won La Liga too at that season btw.\n\nRight now we had lost our two toughest fixtures of the first half of the season (Atletico away, Liverpool away) and just dropped 2 points against a team that are usually tough to play against.\n\nA large part of the difficult schedule is gone. In the UCL we face a winless team away, then Man City at home, then Monaco at home and then Benfica (with 0 points right now) away. That's at least 3 wins if we play our normal football. In La Liga we've faced 5/7 teams that are 2nd-8th right now and we won 4/5 of those games. Look at our record against top 6-8 La Liga teams last season and this will put a smile on your face. ",
