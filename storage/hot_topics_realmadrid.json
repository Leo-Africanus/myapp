If you include everything, not just men's football, but like the basketball team and the creation of a women's team, I think he has done a lot for the club. The Bernabe\u00fa has been upgraded under his tenure, he's brought in Gal\u00e1cticos and won a lot of UCL trophies, in both his 1st and 2nd stint. Fans would always say, you can't replace Cristiano, or Kroos, or Modric, or Ramos, or Zidane, etc. but I think P\u00e9rez is probably going to be the one person we'll miss the most. We literally had to wait decades to go from Bernabe\u00fa to P\u00e9rez, I wonder how long until the next great Real Madrid president shows up.",

        "title": "I rewatched Liverpool vs Real Madrid and I think we overreacted a bit \ud83d\ude2c",
        "content": "\nAfter rewatching the match, a few things stood out:\n\n1. It wasn\u2019t as bad as it first seemed.\nThe first half showed promising rotations and chance creation, but the final pass and finishing were missing. The players are still adapting to a system that requires composure on the ball, something easier to execute in La Liga than against high-intensity teams like Liverpool. We did manage to bypass their midfield often, but the end product wasn\u2019t there.\n\n\n2. Old habits are hard to break.\nThis team is used to transition football, so shifting to a possession-oriented style will take time. Vini, for example, still looks to attack immediately rather than recycle play when needed. We need more patience instead of forcing every forward move into a chance.\n\n\n3. Arda G\u00fcler needs experience.\nHe had a decent first half despite small mistakes, but looked lost when shifted left after the break. I\u2019d chalk that up to inexperience rather than pressure. While many fans see him as a No. 10, I still believe he\u2019s better suited to developing into a deep-lying playmaker.\n\n\n4. Xabi experimented heavily in the second half.\nThe tactical tweaks didn\u2019t come off because the players didn\u2019t seem fully prepared for them. G\u00fcler looked uncertain, Rodrygo didn\u2019t seem to know his role, and the defensive rotations (Fede dropping in, later Tchouameni) caused confusion rather than control. Xabi\u2019s adjustments tried to solve one issue but created another, something normal early in a new coach\u2019s cycle. The team simply needs more time to absorb his ideas.\n\n\n\nOverall:\nThe loss to Liverpool is just a small setback in a long-term project. What matters most is that Xabi keeps the dressing room. Despite negative leaks, I believe, he can still succeed. If he does, Real could dominate for another decade.\n\nHala Madrid.\n\n(Will add more thoughts after watching the Rayo Vallecano match.)",

        "content": "This post will probably be deleted but the truth is I think the board is much more to blame for the shit show than any individual player is and this isn't even me saying this because we lost one or two matches. People going crazy over one or two losses are overreacting but its a valid criticism to say that the way we lost certain matches have been very embarrassing as a supporter of the club. \n\nWhen we won the champions league and league last I don't even think we had the best players individually in the world compared to some other teams but we had a balance like no other. Vini and Rodrygo offered something different to Bellingham and Joselu. Kroos, Valverde and Tchouameni complemented each other and then you could rotate them with Camavinga and modric as needed. We had the ever reliable and professional Nacho and the beast Rudiger in the back Lunin was a positive surprise.\n\nBut the recruitment since that season has been poor and even though I criticized Ancelotti for what I perceived to be a lack of tactics i also realized just how difficult a job he had but still his inability to properly rotate and make early subs probably caused some of our injury issues. \n\nFor example, it took Kroos years of playing the same position to master it, he didn't become the Kroos we know overnight but for some reason we expect Bellingham who has shown he has a knack for getting goals and being a good poacher to suddenly become Kroos.\n\nWhen France won the world cup, there's a reason Giroud was a keypart, he offered a different dimension to the Mbappes and the griezmans but yet we signed Mbappe as a F1 car and expect him to play like a monster truck instead of maybe just signing the monster truck we needed.\n\nWe are asking Tchouameni to play like Kroos when that was never his game, that's like asking Casemiro to turn into modric, they are simply not that type of players but they allow those type of players to flourish.\n\nRamos was also prone to mistakes and stupid red cards early in his career but we expect Dean to become the Ramos we all remember when he was in his prime.\n\n\nBut in saying all this we are still top of the league even with all the flaws in the team and considering we have a manager thats still getting to know the team. Stop blaming individual players and instead blame the board for not properly rebuilding the team with the right players because expecting players to suddenly change their attributes to be a different player is not going to work. Mbappe will never be that type of striker, Valverde or. Bellingham will never be a dictator, Vini will never stop dribbling, Camavinga will never be a winger and Curtois will never be a ball playing keeper. Alonso has to find a way to get the best out of what he has and I trust he will and if we win even the league this year I'll be satisfied with that.",

        "content": "Just watched a La Liga video on all the goals we've scored so far in the 25/26 season, and I'm shitting my pants at how predictable our attack is. \n\n95% of the goals we've scored so far are either penalties or counter-attacks, with an occasional longshot. \n\n\\- We don't score from set pieces\n\n\\- We don't score headers\n\n\\- We barely score from crosses (low or high)\n\n\\- We don't score tap-ins\n\n\\- We don't score from possession play \n\nOur attack is so incredibly one-dimensional. We made a Liverpool defense that  got fucked in the ass by Haaland and Doku look like prime Milan. Anyone who thinks this type of attacking play is sustainable is mentally ill. ",

        "content": "This club has arguably the worst fanbase when it comes to supporting our own players and backing the manager. Just look at other teams that are having a worst season than us, Liverpool literally won the league last season and now they have lost 6 games in a row and are out of the title race and yet I don't hear any slot out, sell this player and sell that player nonsense. \n\nWe only lost two games and drawn one so far this season but the way this fanbase is acting you would think we are in relegation. Everything seems blown out way of proportion and all its doing is feeding into the tabloids/medias hands to create a narrative about how the locker room is in disarray and all those clips in the Rayo game is just proving my point. Just wait until after the international break when we start to win games again how all these \"issues\" just vanish and all the xabi out and player fc hating fans go quiet, it happened after we lost to Atletico Madrid and we bounced back just fine. \n\nlosing to Liverpool in the champions league is not the end of the world as we are still in the top 8, all we need to do is learn from our mistakes and move on. We are so much better than last season, and yet still finding our new identity, its not perfect but we are heading in the right direction.",
