        "content": "#FT: CASTILLA 2:0 CACERE\u00d1O\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#1\u00aa FEDERACI\u00d3N\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:** \n\n1:0 \u00c1lvaro Gin\u00e9s 78'\n\n2:0 C\u00e9sar Palacios (p) 85'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - kickoff, vamos! \n\n3' - heavy rain is pouring down in Madrid, as the team will try to recover from the heavy defeat suffered in M\u00e9rida last week. The unnecessary and inglorious ending of the match has left David Jim\u00e9nez suspended for this match, the captain Manuel \u00c1ngel for 3 matches, and Arbeloa for two matches, meaning his assistant, Juli\u00e1n Carmona is on the sidelines today and next week. Additionally, the team has to compensate for the injuries of Fortea, Fettal, de Llanos and Roberto Mart\u00edn, while Fran Gonz\u00e1lez is with Spain U21\n\n27' - heavy elbow into the Cacere\u00f1o player's face by \u00c1lvaro Leiva, I'm surprised their coach is not asking for a review since their player was treated for a significant nose bleed for a couple of minutes, but he can continue \n\n45'+1 - Mesonero with a free kick near the edge of the box, but from a very tight angle - his cross is hit hard, but gets slightly deflected, and ends up hitting the post, biggest chance for Castilla so far \n\nHT - Castilla are dominating possession without generating much danger in a half that was fully conditioned by the heavy rain and the drenched pitch - if the rain doesn't stop, the conditions won't get better, so this match will be a literal fight in the mud won by whichever team wants it the most \n\n\ud83d\udd04 46' - second half is underway, Diego Aguado comes off after his early yellow card, Cristian David on the pitch now\n\n58' - spectacular dribble by Manu Serrano, who nutmegs his opponent and enters the box - he lays it off to Palacios, whose shot is too central and their keeper can save it \n\n\ud83d\udd04 61' - Loren and Pitarch off, \u00c1lvaro Gin\u00e9s and Bruno on\n\n63' - triple chance for Castilla - Bruno Iglesias' gets put through in the box, but his quick shot is saved by the keeper - the ball drops for Mesonero, who is tackled as he shoots and can't direct the ball goalwards, but instead to \u00c1lvaro Gin\u00e9s, who shoots from a short distance but it gets blocked \n\n65' - Mesonero's shot from the edge of the box is saved by the keeper once more. The goal needs to come quickly now, the Castilla dominance is overwhelming\n\n\ud83d\udd04 70' - Arbeloa and his proxy Juli\u00e1n Carmona use up all their subs early on, Y\u00e1\u00f1ez and Pol Fortuny on for Leiva and Mesonero\n\n74' - Bruno Iglesias with a Kroos-like shot from deep, and it hits the post again... Bad luck at this point for Castilla \n\n\u26bd 78' - GOLLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - Finally! The ball is played out to the left wing, where Bruno puts in a nice cross towards the far post. Cacere\u00f1o make an error in the marking, and \u00c1lvaro Gin\u00e9s is completely open at the far post to head it into the net from a short distance - he crowns his official debut for Castilla with a goal! \n\n82' - penalty for Castilla! Y\u00e1\u00f1ez is brought down at the edge of the box during a counter attack\n\n\u26bd 85' - GOLLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - after a review to see whether the foul was really on the line or just outside, the penalty is given - Palacios steps up and sends the keeper the wrong way, hopefully sealing a very deserved victory! \n\nFT - despite the absence of various players and Arbeloa himself, Castilla manage their potentially best performance of the season in the second half - after struggling more with the waterlogged pitch then the opponent in the first half, the team dominated even more after the rain finally stopped, creating a variety of opportunities, hitting the post twice and finally scoring two goals for a very deserved win. All the players who had to step in today like Mesonero, Bruno, Leiva and \u00c1lvaro Gin\u00e9s contributed nicely, making the absentee list hardly felt on the pitch. Castilla are now 4th again, just 1 point from the leader for the moment\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 14:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee**:  \u00c1lvaro Juncal Moreira\n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 1, Matchday 12\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[LaLiga+](https://www.laligaplus.laliga.com/) (subscription - 14.99\u20ac/month) (only available in Spain)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-3-3): Sergio Mestre - Manu Serrano, V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as, Joan Mart\u00ednez, Diego Aguado (46' Cristian David) - Jorge Cestero, Thiago Pitarch (61' Bruno Iglesias), Dani Mesonero (70' Pol Fortuny) - \u00c1lvaro Leiva (70' Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez), Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga (61' \u00c1lvaro Gin\u00e9s), C\u00e9sar Palacios \n\nBench: Javi Navarro (GK), Guille S\u00fanico (GK), Mario Rivas, Lamini Fati, \u00c1lvaro Lezcano. \n\nUnavailable: Fran Gonz\u00e1lez (Spain U21 call-up), David Jim\u00e9nez (red card suspension), Jes\u00fas Fortea (injury), Manuel \u00c1ngel (red card suspension), Roberto Mart\u00edn (injury), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Rachad Fettal (injury). \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** WWDWL\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 5th | 18pt | 6-0-5 | 13:13\n",

His coolness on the ball, switch of plays, the way he'd orchestrate the offense. And then you add on the fact he left the same season we signed one of the most deadliest players to have on the end of a through ball.\nI don\u2019t even know if this type of post is allowed.

If you include everything, not just men's football, but like the basketball team and the creation of a women's team, I think he has done a lot for the club. The Bernabe\u00fa has been upgraded under his tenure, he's brought in Gal\u00e1cticos and won a lot of UCL trophies, in both his 1st and 2nd stint. Fans would always say, you can't replace Cristiano, or Kroos, or Modric, or Ramos, or Zidane, etc. but I think P\u00e9rez is probably going to be the one person we'll miss the most. We literally had to wait decades to go from Bernabe\u00fa to P\u00e9rez, I wonder how long until the next great Real Madrid president shows up.",

        "title": "I rewatched Liverpool vs Real Madrid and I think we overreacted a bit \ud83d\ude2c",
        "content": "\nAfter rewatching the match, a few things stood out:\n\n1. It wasn\u2019t as bad as it first seemed.\nThe first half showed promising rotations and chance creation, but the final pass and finishing were missing. The players are still adapting to a system that requires composure on the ball, something easier to execute in La Liga than against high-intensity teams like Liverpool. We did manage to bypass their midfield often, but the end product wasn\u2019t there.\n\n\n2. Old habits are hard to break.\nThis team is used to transition football, so shifting to a possession-oriented style will take time. Vini, for example, still looks to attack immediately rather than recycle play when needed. We need more patience instead of forcing every forward move into a chance.\n\n\n3. Arda G\u00fcler needs experience.\nHe had a decent first half despite small mistakes, but looked lost when shifted left after the break. I\u2019d chalk that up to inexperience rather than pressure. While many fans see him as a No. 10, I still believe he\u2019s better suited to developing into a deep-lying playmaker.\n\n\n4. Xabi experimented heavily in the second half.\nThe tactical tweaks didn\u2019t come off because the players didn\u2019t seem fully prepared for them. G\u00fcler looked uncertain, Rodrygo didn\u2019t seem to know his role, and the defensive rotations (Fede dropping in, later Tchouameni) caused confusion rather than control. Xabi\u2019s adjustments tried to solve one issue but created another, something normal early in a new coach\u2019s cycle. The team simply needs more time to absorb his ideas.\n\n\n\nOverall:\nThe loss to Liverpool is just a small setback in a long-term project. What matters most is that Xabi keeps the dressing room. Despite negative leaks, I believe, he can still succeed. If he does, Real could dominate for another decade.\n\nHala Madrid.\n\n(Will add more thoughts after watching the Rayo Vallecano match.)",

        "content": "I was watching the game last night (as a neutral but hoping Madrid would win for something different, also Bar\u00e7a have annoying fans) and unlike last season where Madrid got a historic 3\u20131 away win over Bar\u00e7a, this season it returned to usual with a 4\u20130 away defeat for Las Blancas (the same as the 4\u20130 loss at home last season).\n\nYes Bar\u00e7a have a better squad and Madrid need to start caring about their women's team a lot more, but the squad difference isn't big enough to be bent over every single time. Last season there were five El Cl\u00e1sicos: Bar\u00e7a won 4\u20130, 5\u20130 (twice) and 3\u20131 then Madrid won 3\u20131.\n\nBar\u00e7a lost 1\u20130 to Sociedad this season and 2\u20131 to Levante last season, so they are beatable, plus they only have 17 players due to their financial problems. It's almost like Madrid have been given their best present and chance at silverware but yet they keep proving they can't do it.\n\nDo your players just not play for the badge or what?",

I want to know place and time or about where they're staying to even see them from far and I don't know where to go to find out. I have some information from some other madrid fan friends I have because they seem more involved, but they seem to know nothing about this. Also, about the tickets, do you know RM itself sells away tickets for ucl nights? Maybe if I can't find home tickets I can find away ones!? thhanks\n",

        "content": "This post will probably be deleted but the truth is I think the board is much more to blame for the shit show than any individual player is and this isn't even me saying this because we lost one or two matches. People going crazy over one or two losses are overreacting but its a valid criticism to say that the way we lost certain matches have been very embarrassing as a supporter of the club. \n\nWhen we won the champions league and league last I don't even think we had the best players individually in the world compared to some other teams but we had a balance like no other. Vini and Rodrygo offered something different to Bellingham and Joselu. Kroos, Valverde and Tchouameni complemented each other and then you could rotate them with Camavinga and modric as needed. We had the ever reliable and professional Nacho and the beast Rudiger in the back Lunin was a positive surprise.\n\nBut the recruitment since that season has been poor and even though I criticized Ancelotti for what I perceived to be a lack of tactics i also realized just how difficult a job he had but still his inability to properly rotate and make early subs probably caused some of our injury issues. \n\nFor example, it took Kroos years of playing the same position to master it, he didn't become the Kroos we know overnight but for some reason we expect Bellingham who has shown he has a knack for getting goals and being a good poacher to suddenly become Kroos.\n\nWhen France won the world cup, there's a reason Giroud was a keypart, he offered a different dimension to the Mbappes and the griezmans but yet we signed Mbappe as a F1 car and expect him to play like a monster truck instead of maybe just signing the monster truck we needed.\n\nWe are asking Tchouameni to play like Kroos when that was never his game, that's like asking Casemiro to turn into modric, they are simply not that type of players but they allow those type of players to flourish.\n\nRamos was also prone to mistakes and stupid red cards early in his career but we expect Dean to become the Ramos we all remember when he was in his prime.\n\n\nBut in saying all this we are still top of the league even with all the flaws in the team and considering we have a manager thats still getting to know the team. Stop blaming individual players and instead blame the board for not properly rebuilding the team with the right players because expecting players to suddenly change their attributes to be a different player is not going to work. Mbappe will never be that type of striker, Valverde or. Bellingham will never be a dictator, Vini will never stop dribbling, Camavinga will never be a winger and Curtois will never be a ball playing keeper. Alonso has to find a way to get the best out of what he has and I trust he will and if we win even the league this year I'll be satisfied with that.",
