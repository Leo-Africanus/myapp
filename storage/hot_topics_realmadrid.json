        "title": "I think RM squad will remain the same after the winter transfer market and it's the right call",
        "content": "It's always exciting to get new players in the squad and this seems to be a time RM needs more than ever a few reinforcements in defense. Even before Millitao and Carvaja's injuries, one could argue there was a need for at least 2 more for rotation purposes. \n\n  \nNow, with that being said, I don't think Perez, Jose Angel Sanchez, and Juni Calafat are going to be making any changes during the winter transfer market. Maybe at best a youngster from a smaller team, but I don't think there's going to be a major project built over winter and even less likely to get Trent Alexander Arnold or Alphonso Davies. And here's why I think so:\n\n  \nLiverpool is an position to win the Premier League and a strong candidate for the CL. Arnold ends contract but if RM were to push for a winter transfer, Liverpool would have enough leverage to ask for the market value of the player. Second, I think they feel confident they can still retain him past this season, specially if they win the EPL and/or the CL. The player would benefit more if he joins RM next season, free from a contract, and so does RM.\n\nDavies would be more accessible and RM and Bayern keep good relations, but nevertheless, if RM pushes for Davies, Bayern would immediately get leverage to ask for a reasonable price. Davies has a lot more to gain, if he just waits to join RM as a free agent, and so does RM.\n\n  \nWhat else is on the table? Certainly, not any players that would be occupying Davies and Arnold's position, if they are a major interest for next season.\n\nNow central defense. I think with Rudiger, Raul Asencio, and Tchameni coming back soon to cover that position, it's unlikely for RM to go for a top player in that position for now. This is the only position I see a possible youngster or veteran from a smaller team but still unlikely.\n\n  \nI think given the circumstances, RM is likely to stay the same this season. I think it's the right call also. At the end, a defense with Valverde/ Lucas Vasquez, Rudiger, Asencio/Tchuameni, Mendi/Frank Garcia/Camavinga... it's got to push thru this season. It's not ideal but RM will do fine. ",

Not only has he been resilient defensively, he's shown that he ia able to move the ball forward which is necessary in today's football. I hope that Alaba/Militao/Tchou coming back won't push him to the bench because he has shown that he deserves a chance. I also hope this motivates the coaching staff to be more open to trying talents from the younger team, the squad has been ravaged by injuries so this is the time to take a chance on these guys.",

Now I am hearing that mbapp\u00e9 and Jude are both out for the game and I just feel so gutted that my first game will be watching a very depleted lineup playing castilla players that I won't even know about... Even paid extra on the tickets to have a good seat closer to the dugout\n\nOf course I am happy to enjoy the atmosphere of the stadium and support my team regardless but just frustrating that I somehow managed to choose the worst match possible of the year.",
