        "content": "Obviously, you don\u2019t remember the time when we had to wait 12 years for a Champions League victory. With players like Zidane, Raul, Ronaldo, Robinho, Beckham, Baptista, Casillas, Ramos, Pepe, Marcelo... absolute club legends. Obviously, you don\u2019t remember how nobody believed in us in 2013/2014, that we could actually win the UCL. Obviously, you don\u2019t remember how everyone criticized Real Madrid for signing Modri\u0107, how that transfer was even labeled one of the worst in the club\u2019s history, and that the club supposedly wasted around 45 million euros on a totally average player.\n\nBut most importantly, you\u2019ve got foggy memories and don\u2019t remember how tough those matches were and how many times we had to come back from behind. Everyone acts as if Real Madrid used to step onto the pitch and completely dominate, being a class above every opponent. Which simply wasn\u2019t the case. Those were hard-fought victories, often after very poor performances, especially in the knockout stages.\n\nYou\u2019re spoiled and expect Real Madrid to crush anyone by several classes. Look at the 2021/2022 season, once again, nobody believed we could win, and in every single match we were the underdogs. Every knockout game was extremely difficult, and often we were outplayed. Same thing in 2023/2024.\n\nEveryone keeps saying we\u2019ve been playing \u201cnothing\u201d for the last few seasons, yet in those few seasons we\u2019ve won the Champions League twice and La Liga twice.\n\nWe lost 1\u20130 to Liverpool in the UCL group stage and everyone loses their minds... You\u2019re exactly the same type of people who criticized Real Madrid back in 2012: \u201cWhy is this guy playing and not that one? Why did we buy this player instead of that one? This one has to go, that one\u2019s a disappointment.\u201d Instead of proudly supporting the best team in the world, you\u2019re throwing crap at it. But history will show you were wrong.\n\nShow me a single team that has as many Champions League titles as Real Madrid. Show me a single team that has won 6 UCLs in the last 12 years. Show me a single team that has managed to defend the UCL title twice in a row under the modern knockout format. Let alone winning it three times in a row, a record that won\u2019t be broken for decades.\n\nReal Madrid has always had weaker seasons during rebuilds, and it\u2019s always proven to be just a matter of time before we ruled Europe again. Your pathetic analyses and dramatic comments like \u201cthey played absolute garbage,\u201d \u201cXabi is useless,\u201d \u201cextremely disappointed with the performance,\u201d etc., are laughable. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just this subreddit that\u2019s so toxic and spoiled and who\u2019ve only supported Real Madrid for a few years and don\u2019t know what a real crisis looks like or if this is now the standard kind of Real Madrid fan, but honestly, you should be ashamed.\n\nAm I happy with the way we play? No. But we\u2019re in a rebuilding phase, and Xabi has been coach for only few months. We\u2019re first in La Liga. We won El Cl\u00e1sico. We\u2019re the best-performing Spanish team in the UCL and quite possibly the only Spanish club that will qualify directly for the Round of 16. Yet all you can say is how terrible we play.\n\nPull your heads out of your asses and stop pretending to be professional football analysts, because you clearly have no idea what\u2019s actually going on.",

        "content": "After the Club World Cup ended, all of us Madridistas were happy about the emergence of a new striker \u2014 someone we thought we could rely on, at least as a backup, like Joselu in 2024 or Morata in 2017. I\u2019m talking here about Gonzalo Garc\u00eda.\n\nBut after 16 matches between La Liga and the Champions League, all I see is a player who doesn\u2019t play \u2014 and when he does, it\u2019s only for the last 3 or 4 minutes, either to waste time or to give Mbapp\u00e9 a brief rest so he doesn\u2019t get injured in the final moments.\n\nI understand that Mbapp\u00e9 is the best player in the world, and that he\u2019s untouchable \u2014 but even when you\u2019re the best, that doesn\u2019t mean you have every solution. When facing teams that defend deep inside their box, why not resort to what I like to call the \u201cJoselu card\u201d? A striker who can score with his head when all other options fail, who can play one-touch football and cause chaos for defenders inside the penalty area.\n\nWhy not move Mbapp\u00e9 to the left when Vin\u00edcius isn\u2019t performing well and bring on Gonzalo as a center forward? Why not even substitute Mbapp\u00e9 himself in the last 15 minutes when he\u2019s trapped and unable to make an impact? What\u2019s the point of having a classic number 9 \u2014 physically strong and good in the air \u2014 if you\u2019re not going to use him in matches like yesterday\u2019s?\n\nWe all thought Xabi Alonso trusted young players, but it turns out Mbapp\u00e9 was only absent during the Club World Cup. His handling of Gonzalo has been deeply disappointing.",

Comes on today, gets the ball, looks up, and sees fuck all movement up top. We acquired one of the most creative fullbacks in world football without a clear target man. \n\nThe only time our attackers do make runs into the box is on the counter. Problem is 99% of the teams in this league play ultra low block, so that\u2019s pretty much useless. Might as well send Trent back to Liverpool. ",

But now few months in the season we see big difference in quality again. Whenever Asencio plays he is playing without a mistake, tackling on time, fast, making a good passes everything that we thought Huijsen will be for this season. My opinion is that Xabi is unfair putting Huijsen ahead of him who since the injury he had he is not the same player and is playing without a confidence, i can\u2019t remember when he did something good without making 10 more mistakes after.  Asencio is our academy boy, he is in great form and i don\u2019t see a reason for him not to start with Militao. Xabi is just trying to prove that we didn\u2019t waste 40+ millions on Huijsen despite being so young.",

        "content": "I think we are almost 75% complete in rebuilding, but our main issue is with low block, and high pressing. Anyways xabi was making team play well with 3-4-3, but after CWC he changed to 433 or 442, we are very good defensively, exclude Liverpool and Athleti match, that may be due to inexperience in defensive line, but I am happy with overall defence, but during low block we need to play a proper striker.\n\nI guess board doesn't make him allow Playing 3-4-3, or maybe because of Mbappe's arrival.\n\nIn my opinion(this is purely my opinion): Vini has been dropping stinger on the left, its like he doesn't have a single braincell for decision making, dude has immense talent but his decision making is some times shit, taking on 3 players at once instead of passing and moving forward. I think instead of making Vini competing with Rodrygo, they should make Vini compete with Mbappe on Lw, and in striker Gonzalo or Endrick, or play Endrick in Right wing until Eminem comes back.\n\nYesterday we were just passing and passing and passing nothing in final 3rd, we were playing like headless chicken.\n\nI saw a post saying Perez supports Vini than Xabi, he didn't like the Vini Substitution, that's why we didn't see Vini get substituted. Xabi should be allowed to do whatever he wants, he is senor, and coach.\n\nOur team is good, but to be greatest only few more tweaks and that's it.",

This has to be the only fan base in the world that thinks having the European Golden Boot is a bad thing.\n\nFirst, they were laughing at supportive fans because they predicted Mbapp\u00e9 wouldn't get along with the rest of the team and he wouldn't score as many goals as in the French league.\n\nNow that he became the European top scorer, they say he is \"padding stats\" and \"not helping the team\", they say we need a 9, not him. But what do they want the new 9 to do? Isn't score goals? Or the idea is to replace Mbapp\u00e9 (which is what people are saying) with a 9 that assists? Isn't obvious that having the top scorer is a good thing.\n\nI get that Xabi should think about using a striker that dominates the aerial game, but that cannot be to replace Kylian, but to complement him.\n\nI honestly don't understand how so many people share this opinion. It's insane thinking being the top European scorer is somehow a bad thing.",

        "content": "I can admit that he provided a good number of G/A this season. He also involves himself in high press under Xabi Alonso. But at the same time, I feel like he is playing way too selfishly. Because in the last few matches, I often notice him dribbling forcefully through the defenders even though there are few spaces to pass. Also almost all of real Madrid's attacks comes only from left wing. I wonder if he's taking too much control over the team and also doesn't want to play under Xabi's system. If that's true, I want him to leave because the club will end up getting harmed with his bad attitude. Xabi's philosophy has promise and potential but if he loses the dressing room, then it'll be for nothing. Let me know if I am wrong. Thanks.",
