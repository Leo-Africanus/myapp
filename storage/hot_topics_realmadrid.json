        "title": "Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s: the exiled genius who conquered Madrid and the world",
        "content": "Some legends are born, some are made, and some survive everything history throws at them. Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s was all three.\n\n\n\nIn the 1950s, he was the star of Hungary\u2019s Mighty Magyars, the team that changed football forever. Short, stocky, and left-footed, Pusk\u00e1s wasn\u2019t built like a classic athlete. But when the ball came to that left foot, it was magic \u2014 thunderous strikes, precise passes, goals from impossible angles. Hungary went unbeaten for four years, humiliated England at Wembley in 1953, and reached the World Cup final in 1954. Pusk\u00e1s was the heartbeat of it all.\n\nBut then came politics and tragedy. The Hungarian Uprising of 1956 forced him into exile. He was branded a traitor, banned from football for two years, and at 31, many thought his career was finished. Overweight, aging, and with no club, it looked like the world had seen the last of Pusk\u00e1s.\n\nAnd then came Madrid. Real Madrid took a gamble, and what followed was one of the greatest second acts in football history. Slimmed down and reborn, Pusk\u00e1s formed a devastating partnership with Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano. Together they turned Madrid into the ultimate powerhouse of European football. Pusk\u00e1s scored goals for fun \u2014 hat-tricks, four in a European Cup final, even a famous five-goal haul in a Cl\u00e1sico against Barcelona.\n\nIn total, he scored 242 goals in 262 games for Real Madrid \u2014 numbers so outrageous they barely seem real. He won 3 European Cups, 5 league titles, and a Pichichi trophy four times. For a man who was supposed to be finished, it was pure redemption.\n\nWhat made Pusk\u00e1s beloved wasn\u2019t just the goals, though. It was his humanity. He was humble, warm, a joker in the dressing room. Fans called him \u201cPancho,\u201d and in Madrid he wasn\u2019t seen as a foreigner but as family.\n\nWhen he finally retired, he left behind not just records but a legacy of resilience. He had been a golden boy in Hungary, an outcast in exile, and then a reborn legend in Spain. Today, FIFA\u2019s award for the best goal of the year carries his name \u2014 the Pusk\u00e1s Award \u2014 a fitting tribute to the man whose left foot was poetry.\n\nFerenc Pusk\u00e1s wasn\u2019t just a footballer. He was proof that genius can\u2019t be broken by politics, age, or exile. For many, he will always be remembered as the exiled genius who conquered Madrid and the world.",

        "content": "Hi guys, just want to share what I have in mind. Mbappe form is excellent right now, he is much more clinical and confident in finishing, even in penalty now it is much harder to read where he aim to shoot. This is what I want from striker. The opposing team has fear where he's at and has to keep an eye on him, with or without ball. some legendary striker like R9, CR7, and so on also has this. But unfortunately, some of our players got this idea of 'Just give him a good ball and he will score' While this is really good we can't have the whole team think like this. Arda Guler does a great job finding him and at the same time find the space and position to score a goal himself. Our player should take advantage that more than 1 defender try to defend Mbappe and find the space to shoot or create chances, but sadly from the several games so far under Xabi, for example Vini does not take advantage of the space to create havoc. I guess I would say this is the same problem with Jude and Fede but Jude just came back from Injury so might be that. I hope Fede realized this and try to shoot more like in the past. I have high hopes for Franco (as well as Brahim) as he seems to understand about this like Arda. If one day Mbappe can't play I'm not sure if we have a backup plan if we didn't find solution to this. Thoughts?",
