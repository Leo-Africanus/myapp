        "content": "Today, as Lucas V\u00e1zquez prepares to leave Real Madrid after more than a decade of service, every Madridista\u2019s heart is a little heavier.\n\nLucas, you were never the flashiest name on the team sheet. You weren\u2019t the superstar signing, the record-breaker, or the headline-maker. But you were *something even rarer*: the beating heart of the team, the glue that held squads together, the tireless worker who never stopped running, never stopped believing, and never stopped *bleeding white*.\n\nFrom your earliest days in Castilla, we saw your determination. You fought your way into the first team, not with hype, but with pure effort, humility, and a relentless spirit. You became the ultimate team player \u2014 whether playing as a winger or filling in at right-back, you gave 100%, every single minute, every single match.\n\nWe will never forget your cold-blooded penalties in shootouts, your decisive crosses, your fearless pressing, and your ability to step up when the big names were missing. You were there in the finals, in the title runs, in the tough moments when the team needed stability and courage.\n\nOff the pitch, you were the joker in the locker room, the humble Galician who always wore a smile, the one who kept spirits high. On the pitch, you were the embodiment of *\u00a1Hala Madrid y nada m\u00e1s!* \u2014 fighting for every badge on your chest, for every fan in the stands, for every child dreaming in white.\n\nLucas, you leave not just as a player, but as a *Madridista eterno*. You showed the world what it means to serve Real Madrid with loyalty, sacrifice, and love.\n\nThank you for every sprint, every tackle, every laugh, and every tear. You may leave the club, but your spirit will always echo in the Bernab\u00e9u. Wherever you go, remember: you will always have a home here, and you will always be part of the Real Madrid family.\n\n\ud83d\udcac *Gracias por todo, Lucas.*  \n\ud83d\udc9c Once a Madridista, always a Madridista.  \n\u26aa *Hala Madrid\u2026 \u00a1por siempre!*",

        "content": "I was 7, grew up in a place  called Badajoz on Spain Portugal border. My cousin from India ( my dad is Indian) had come to visit us for his vacations, he was a huge Madrid fan so my dad took us to Lisbon for his birthday. \nI couldn't understand much, I saw him crying \" we cannot win La Decima, beautiful chance, it will never be ours\"\nAnd then the stadium erupted, 93rd minute, Sergio Ramos scored the goal.\nAnd the moment was pure magic, people screamed, bugged, it was chaotic yet magical, my dad had me on his shoulders so that I could see clearly, and I did, saw the most beautiful goal, since then, today, till forever, Madrid chose me and I am a Madrid fan. Hala Madrid y Nada M\u00e1s. 11 years ago today Ramos scored the goal in 93rd minute and glory returned to our cabinet.",
