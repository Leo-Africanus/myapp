        "content": "I think mastuono, despite his huge signing fees, is not talked enough as a youngster(mentioned signing fees because with huge fees you get more attention). For instance, he has similar or better stats than Yamal had in the first 15 games. Maybe Yamal was younger than him so we can't really compare them. Arda was the talk of football community when he signed with us, his age-18 was the highlight. Mastuono being of similar age, I don't really see him getting similar fame others before him got.\n\nAnd, I personally feel he's the proper right winger we've got since Gareth bale, a left footed right winger. Like we also had rodrygo and he was nice on the right, but him being right footed always had us lacking something during games. Mastantuono helps in so much ways, creates a balance on both sides while attacking. He runs, presses, tracks back, passes perfectly,...RUNS. Maybe he runs too much at times, but he doesn't look under confident on the pitch, and the number of fck ups are quite negligible by him.\n\nI feel like we don't talk about him enough like we did about Arda or huijsen. Or even the football media don't talk about him enough like they did with the likes of Yamal or cubarsi or pedri, etc.",

Only downside is his age (29 this summer). Tbh I think both are great choices.\n\nI'm leaning more towards Neves, just so that we have more money to spend on a top defender as well, preferably someone like Schlotterbeck, who'll cost us around 50-70 million.",

        "content": "One of the biggest thing Zidane did first and foremost in his 2016 takeover that lead to our UCL three-peat was finding his fixed Starting XI and the fundamental formation. Arbeloa's last three matches have gone really well. Starting XI is starting to form an identity and the combinations are clicking as he would have desired. But he was lucky with the suspension of Carreras and the injury of Rodrygo to find his preferred combinations where he slotted Camavinga as LB and Mastantuono as RW against Monaco - a match that proved to be our biggest win and our best performance of the last two seasons.\n\nYesterday, Tchouameni's suspension ensured that the dynamism of Camavinga was there on the pitch. Mastantuono's work ethic and pressing strengths are becoming indispensible to the team. \n\nHow do you think Arbeloa will find a way?",
