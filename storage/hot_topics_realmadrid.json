I know we are his dream club but PSG wanted him badly. So Xabi, rates him very highly.\n\nI've been looking at alot of his videos and saw some of the replays of the games where he performed well. Out of all the players we got from SA in the recent years, he is clearly the most ready to get minutes. The other's were not ready and simply prospects but this guy just needs to adapt to the team and league.\n\nSimilar to Yamal. Franco is an agile dribbler who doesnt reply on his physicality like Vini to dribble past people. He also is amazing at link ups and through balls. I noticed alot of times his playmaking was too good for River plate players, where he would do an amazing pass but his teamamtes would not be able to predict the pass and go into space.\n\nWith players like Mbappe, Vini...etc. he wont have this problem.\n\nOut of Arda and Franco. I can see one of them become a CM. Or even both. They are just too good to not play together",

Or simply because we didn't pass to the right very often and had few runs in that direction.\n\nAs a result, players such as Rodrygo and Guler struggled and were frequently almost 'invisible' at times . FEDE had to play much more defensively.\n\n But recently in CWC (I know we mostly played 532), both sides have received the ball more evenly, and goals are no longer coming solely from the left side. I can't speak for our friendly game.partly because i didn't actually \ud83d\ude05 watch it \ud83e\udd26. \n\nHopefully this eye opener can justify  some players underperformances.you can't go crazy when you don't get the ball check out CDR final and how Guler played in RW almost didn't sniff the ball till he got subbed off.",

        "title": "What position should Camavinga play?",
        "content": "All. Sorry for the bad joke, but now being fr, where he should play? It's hard to define position that would suit him the best. Personally, I think something between 6 and 8. Definitely not classic 6, too many stupid fouls, feels electric on this position. But as a double pivot, someone who just runs, joins attacks, press is just ideal. However, I think that the problems is that he needs some tactical lessons from Xabi, catch some focus, get rid of sloppiness. I also think he has some ADHD (jk), he runs a lot, he is probably amongst one of the most pressing players but I think he should press smarter not harder. I just hope that Xabi will tame this beast, cuz my boy has just so much potential. He also needs to be more present in the attack, everybody remembers his assist to Vini against city right and his goal against city too, right? The only problem I can see is when we will play organised football, when we control, he might struggle, because he is a king of chaos, but he will adjust\ud83d\udcaa I believe in him.\n\nSorry for the chaos and the mistakes if there are any but I'm just like him\ud83d\ude1d",

        "title": "I truly cannot understand this subs opinions on Vini and Rodrygo.",
        "content": "I genuinely cannot understand how Vini has 3 straight seasons of being the best LW in the world, or atleast a top 3, from 21/22 up until the middle of last season, consistently being a big gamer player, consistently hitting 40+g/a, even last season which was a bad season for Vini, he hits 40+g/a, but the moment he has a bad season, this sub is calling for him to be benched or even sold, while Rodrygo is incredibly inconsistent but somehow doesn't meet the same type of criticism as Vini?\n\nRodrygo hasn't scored a league goal since January, and this sub thinks he's gonna magically be better than Vini at LW because he had a good run of games in december? Like, Rodrygo has a pretty consistent history of being a very inconsistent player, he'll play anywhere between bad to okay, but never really amazing, but then, usually in November to January, he'll have a really good run of games, and thats all people really remember, and its enough for people to want him to replace Vini, who has been a consistently top 3 player in the LW spot? Like why would you ever even take this gamble on that Rodrygo will magically lose his inconsistent nature once he's put on the LW position?\n\nI know all the comments are gonna talk about how Rodrygo is being played out of position, but come on, they guy has been playing RW for like 4 or 5 seasons at this point, when are you gonna stop treating him with baby gloves? He either adapts to the position, like Bale did, or he gets benched or sold for someone who is better in that position. I love Rodrygo, i think every madrid fan does, but holy fuck i cannot understand how you guys will relentlessly shit on Vini for half of a bad season, but you will praise Rodrygo endlessly while he disappears for months on end?",
