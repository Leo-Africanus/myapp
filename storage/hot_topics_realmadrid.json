        "title": "What I Learnt Going to Watch Real Madrid",
        "content": "I thought I\u2019d share what I Iearnt when buying tickets to see Real Madrid play if you\u2019re coming from abroad. When I was doing my research, I found some information a bit hard to find, and some of the information on this sub is outdated. \n\n1. Tickets only go on sale a few days before the game.\n\n2. On the website, for the game you\u2019re going to, they\u2019ll release the times that tickets go on sale about 10-12 days before the game under *Mas Informacion/More Information*.\n\n3. I didn\u2019t get a Madridista premium membership and I still got tickets. From what I can gather, it\u2019s not much help, but ymmv. Especially as the chances of getting a ticket seem to be higher the longer you wait.\n\n4. There is no ticket or box office at the stadium, which I found really surprising. I think it is terrible for fans as it favours touts, resellers and bots. I asked at the stadium club shop, the tour ticket office, and at the club shop in the city. Every time, I was directed to one place: online. Which is great when the website is so terrible.\n\n5. When tickets do go on sale, just like the best football teams you\u2019re gonna need three P\u2019s: **Patience, Persistence, and Pressing** the same buttons over and over and over again.\n\n6. This is how the process went for me: Press \u201cbuy tickets\u201d &gt; Enter a queue &gt; Es tu turno &gt; Select how many tickets you want &gt; Select a stand that has availability &gt; Select a section that has availability &gt; Ticket isn\u2019t actually available &gt; Get sent back to select how many tickets you want &gt; Repeat this process as tickets randomly appear and disappear all over the stadium.\n\n7. New tickets are always popping up, so if you see them dwindling and can\u2019t get one, save your sanity and come back later.\n\n8. I didn\u2019t get tickets the day they went on sale or the day after. I got them about 10 pm on the third day after trying constantly. I don\u2019t know this for certain, but I\u2019d say that being in Spain helps because the website you access was different when I got to Madrid than it was when I tried at home. I tried a VPN and that didn\u2019t work.\n\n9. It\u2019s hard to get seats together. One of the things I think helped was switching from trying to get two tickets to one ticket. Then, after getting one, I went back through the process and got another fairly quickly. In the end, my friend and I were sat in different sections, but at least we had tickets.\n\n10. I\u2019m from the UK and didn\u2019t have an issue with my card because we have 3D Secure payments, which seems to be the issue with US cards.\n\n11. The night before the game, I decided to have another look and found it much easier to get a ticket. The process above still occurred, but with a much higher success rate (even some in the same section). This might be because all the tickets that season ticket holders aren\u2019t using had finally been added to the website, but that\u2019s just my guess. Also, strangely, the UI had changed slightly.\n\n12. The morning of the game, around 9am (kick off at 2pm), I looked *again* and found tickets in some pretty desirable locations actually. Then I checked back at around 11/12pm and nada. I couldn't even get in to see what tickets were available because it sent me to a different screen. I kept checking until I entered the stadium around 10 mins before kick off and it stayed the same. \n\n13. If you\u2019ve been stuck in the ticket selection carousel long enough to question your life choices, it pays off in the end. Watching Real Madrid at the new Bernabeu stadium is amazing, and even more impressive than I thought it would be.\n\n\n**A final thing to note**: This is all based on my experience trying to get tickets for the game against Osasuna, so obviously not one of the more in-demand games. If you\u2019re trying to get tickets for, say, El Clasico or AC Milan, I imagine you\u2019ll have a much different experience\u2014likely ending with a visit to StubHub after calling your loan advisor.\n\n\nI hope this helps someone. Overall it is a frustrating experience, but so worth it in the end! ",

Why not just terminate his contract, pay him off and then give that spot to a defender in the academy? Surely giving the opportunity to a young defender is a much better idea than having someone get paid to simply warm the bench. It\u2019s pointless",

        "content": "The reason Mbapp\u00e9 doesn\u2019t fit well so far is that he lacks Real Madrid\u2019s intense work rate. Almost every player in the starting XI had to earn their spot, often starting from the bench. Vini proved himself to be worthy of the No. 7 shirt and a starting role after four years. Rodrygo is playing out of position and still doesn\u2019t have guaranteed minutes. Both Vini and Rodrigo chase the ball back when they lose it. Last season, Kroos and Modri\u0107 rarely played 90 minutes despite being here for 12-14 years. Arda and Endrick are constantly playing 5-15 minutes only or not coming on at all. They still make relentless runs, and press because they know they\u2019ll earn a spot in 1-2 years. Camavinga, Tchouam\u00e9ni, and Modri\u0107\u2014no one gets 90 minutes or plays in their preferred position by default; they\u2019re always working for it. Players like Bellingham and Valverde constantly play 90 minutes because they\u2019ve already proven themselves. It\u2019s clear their work rate is exceptional. Lunin was a fantastic keeper last season, but didn\u2019t play in the finals. Joselu gave his all, but we didn\u2019t keep him. Literally everyone has worked hard to earn the starting XI except mbappe.\n\nAll our players are constantly pressing; even in 2022, Benzema pressed when he lost the ball. In addition to that, all our attackers\u2014along with Bellingham\u2014have expert positioning. (Just look at the goals vs. Osasuna: Bellingham and Vini\u2019s final goal should have been Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s, but he didn\u2019t make the run.) They find space and position themselves; they don\u2019t just wait for the ball. But Mbapp\u00e9, \"King of France,\" was constantly receiving passes at PSG and for France, where he didn\u2019t have to press or find space. That\u2019s why he\u2019s not used to it. He expects players to constantly pass to him. When he loses the ball, he drops his head and doesn\u2019t press. \n\nHe has Ronaldo\u2019s arrogance, but Ronaldo was manageable because he delivered results and still made runs. Mbapp\u00e9, on the other hand, is a roadblock for us. I think Ancelotti should instruct him to start positioning himself better, pressing and making those runs, or reduce his minutes and give Endrick, Arda, and Bellingham a chance to play in the ST/CAM roles. He\u2019s problem is that he\u2019s basically the president\u2019s son.",

It was not an easy game and they were really serious about it. So why is everyone stuck in the pre-match hate? Seriously, try to enjoy the team.\n\nThis sub is just filled with rant after rant, constant posts about \"what's wrong with Mbapp\u00e9\", talking about sacking Ancelotti, and talking about Florentino P\u00e9rez as if he were the worst president in the history of the club.\n\nYes, there have been mistakes. Yes, it would be great to have two world-class RB and 6 elite CB, but that's not how the market works and the locker room has been amazing thanks to consistency. Last season everyone was criticizing the board for not buying this guy or that guy, but we ended up having a great season. Now, we see that Ancelotti has plan A, B, and C for unfortunate events, like this series of injuries. No club, other than those with unlimited resources, can plan for 4 long injuries in defense.\n\nI thought we were all here to support our club, not to trash it as if we were supporting other teams.\n\nYes, criticizing is good, but the number of hate posts is insane.\n\nHala Madrid!",

        "content": "Since the start of the season I think we\u2019ve all been disappointed with the team. None of our players bar a few have even had the right attitude in games. \n\nNow if we don\u2019t win anything this season. I can live with it. With all the injuries and lack of personnel, if we went and won anything it would be overachieving all things considered. \n\nEven with all of that\u2026 we\u2019re still only 6 points behind Barcelona in the league with a game in hand \ud83e\udd14\n\nThey\u2019re not amazing, we saw that when we played them. This Barcelona team is very beatable, not just for us but for everyone. And they lost today \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\n\nI genuinely believe that if we fix the attitude within the dressing room, and Carlo rotates more with youth (He is forced to at this point) we still have a good chance of winning something. I think at this point we\u2019re forced to sign a new defender in January, as well as promoting AT LEAST one Castilla player in addition to Asencio. Otherwise it would be an insult to players like Rudiger who just don\u2019t get a break. \n\nWhen you think back to seasons like 19/20, it\u2019s possible. So we as fans need to believe it\u2019s possible too. ",

        "content": "Let's be realistic for a moment, unless Perez makes some record-breaking crazy offer, every scenario of Saliba, Romero, Bastoni, VVD etc. for the Winter transfer window is completely unrealistic. There's a chance we might pursue some of these player in the summer, but no big team would want to sell their star defender in the middle of the season and some of these players also won't want to leave, out of respect for their teams.\n\nSergio Ramos for 6 months is something we would all love to see as fans, but I doubt Perez is on the same boat, considering their past. And from what I've seen, there's no other decent free agent CB available.\n\nThere's one team in the UCL that has underperformed a lot by their standards (even worse than us, lol), that's RB Leipzig, with 0 points in 4 games. In the remaining 4 they have to face Inter, Aston Villa, Sporting Lisbon and Sturm Graz, so there's very realistic chance they won't even manage to qualify for the play-offs. This means no European football for Leipzig after the league phase.\n\nThis might be a good opportunity for us to try to convince Castello Lukeba, their starting CB, to join in January. We offer him an almost guaranteed starting spot in the best club in the world and (most likely) UCL football in the second half of the season. Lukeba is French and 21 years old, sounds like a pretty realistic signing based on our policy. He is also left footed.The only problem is that he has a MV of 40m and he just renewed his contract, so even a 50-60m offer might get rejected. And I don't think Perez is very happy to spend that money, but he HAS TO do something at this point.\n\nDespite Leipzig's poor form in the UCL, they have the best defense in the Bundesliga, with only 5 goals conceded so far. His Fotmob average is 7.29, Whoscored is 7.02. There are already some rumors about him and for me, he looks like the most realistic option, if we're to actually sign someone in a couple of months.\n\n**EDIT**: Title \"There's only ONE CB\"",
