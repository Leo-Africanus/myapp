        "title": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 at Real Madrid: Stat padder or Contributor? Narrative vs Facts (OC)",
        "content": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 at Real Madrid: Stat padder or Contributor? Narrative vs. Facts (OC) \n\nIn recent weeks, I've heard lots of \"riveting\" commentary about Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and how all he does is pad his stats since he signed for Real Madrid. Not only is that claim false, but it's one that's based in narrative and is wrong. To prove it, I will use facts and statistics. A novel concept, I know. Does Mbapp\u00e9 stat pad or contribute for Real Madrid? Let's take a look. \n\nTo disprove this claim, I'll only use statistics such as goals and assists and then compare it to Madrid's overall success in terms of games won or lost. \n\nFirst, let's look up \"stat padding\" and find out what it means. This is a term used in all sports, but I'm keeping it within a football-related boundary. From a football standpoint, stat padding is when a player focuses on boosting their personal statistics (goals, assists, etc.) in ways that offer little benefit to winning and team success. It's when a player selfishly accumulates numbers instead of providing genuine contribution for the team. \n\nSince Mbapp\u00e9 arrived in June 2024, Real Madrid has played 94 matches. Of those 94 matches, Mbapp\u00e9 has played in 83 of them. He's missed 11 matches because of injury or suspension. Here's what I found: \n\nKylian Mbapp\u00e9 (83 games, 83 G/A - 73 goals, 10 assists) \n\n* 2025-26 (26 team matches; 24 matches played) \n   * 33 G/A in 24 matches (29 goals, 4 assists) \n   * 19 games out of 24 that Mbapp\u00e9 scored/assisted = 79.2% win rate \n   * A record of 16-2-1 in those 19 games = 84.2% win rate \n   * A record of 2-1-2 that Mbapp\u00e9 didn't score/assist = 40% win rate \n* 2024-25 (68 team matches; 59 matches played) \n   * 50 G/A in 59 matches (44 goals, 6 assists) \n   * 35 games out of 59 that Mbapp\u00e9 scored/assisted = 59.3% win rate \n   * A record of 30-2-3 in those 35 games = 85.7% win rate \n   * A record of 9-3-12 that Mbapp\u00e9 didn't score/assist = 37.5% win rate \n* Total number of games in which Mbapp\u00e9 scored/assisted \n   * 54 games \n   * A record of 46-4-4 in those 54 games = 85.2% win rate \n* Total number of games in which Mbapp\u00e9 didn't score/assist \n   * 29 games \n   * A record of 11-4-14 in those 29 games = 37.9% win rate \n* Total number of games Mbapp\u00e9 scored or assisted / games played \n   * 54 games out of 83 = 65.1% win rate \n* Total number of games Mbapp\u00e9 didn't score or assist / games played \n   * 29 games out of 83 = 34.9% win rate \n* Madrid's overall record when Mbapp\u00e9 plays \n   * 83 games \n   * A record of 57-8-18 = 68.7% win rate \n* Madrid's overall record when Mbapp\u00e9 isn't playing \n   * 11 games \n   * A record of 7-3-1 = 63.6% win rate \n\nAs you can see, Mbapp\u00e9 plays a role in Madrid winning. When he plays and contributes, Madrid's winning rate ranges from 65-85% and an overall team rate of 69%. When he plays and doesn't contribute, Madrid's winning rate ranges from 35-38% and an overall team rate of 31%. \n\nOf the 83 games Mbapp\u00e9 has played, the only game where he truly stat padded was against Espanyol at home in La Liga last season. Madrid won that game 4-1. With the score at 3-1, Mbapp\u00e9 scored a late penalty to add to the lead. Before then, with Madrid leading 2-1, he contributed an assist to Vin\u00edcius to make it 3-1. He simultaneously stat padded and sealed the game. \n\nYou're probably thinking: \"Well, how many of Mbapp\u00e9's goals and assists have come in crucial moments for Madrid?\" Of his 83 G/A, 78 of them have played a role in Madrid tying, taking the lead, or putting the game out of reach. 69 goals and 9 assists total. \n\nUnder these \"clutch categories\" (tying, taking the lead, or putting the game out of reach), Real Madrid's record is: \n\n* 53 games \n* A record of 45-4-4 = 84.9% win rate \n\nWith the knee injury Mbapp\u00e9 just picked up, we'll be missing that contribution for some games. At the same time, Madrid has a winning rate of 63.6% when Mbapp\u00e9 is out so it's manageable. \n\nHis \"stat padding\" is contribution and that contribution has been a 1 G/A per game average since his arrival. Calling it stat padding is a narrative which simply discredits what he's done for Madrid so far. He impacts winning, team success, and even clutch moments. Get better soon, Kylian. \n\nSource: [besoccer.com](http://besoccer.com) ",

I see some good seats on Stubhub that are not VIP/Hospitality - I\u2019m not sure if those are legitimate or a scam, since right now you can only buy VIP/hospitality seats directly from the club. \n\nI do have Madridista Premium but have heard that the ticket offerings are pretty picked over by the time they are released to the public. \n\nSociedad aren\u2019t great this year though so can I expect more/better tickets to be available closer to the match? \n\nAny insight or advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks!",

Not every player is gonna be Totti or Ryan Giggs for fvxk sake. \n\nFor example, I am a huge Real Madrid fan since birth and I was scouted by a Barcelona agent, years later I become a star in Barcelona but that is not my dream club, yes I appreciate Barcelona for making me a star but that is not my dream club. \n\nLennart Karl has always been a real Madrid fan, he has a picture where he wore the full Real Madrid kit, but he got scouted by a Bayern agent.\n\nLennart Karl is a great player but with Nico Paz coming back, Arda guler, Bellingham, Brahim,  i don't see him coming to Madrid.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this?",

I hope that if one day one of our players comes out and claims they would like to play somewhere else at some point, we do not do the same as Bayern. It\u2019s funny because I had Bayern as one of the best fan bases. Same with Liverpool, and then the whole Trent thing happened. It seems like when a player is going to Madrid they just hate to see it. I would not crash out over it unless one of our players pulls a figo. ",

But he\u2019s not even completed his 1st full season at a huge club like Bayern so was it really necessary to basically indicate Bayern as sort of a stepping stone in his career? \n\nI\u2019m glad cause it\u2019s my club but what if Madrid don\u2019t go for him? Secondly where does he fit in? We\u2019re already struggling with Bellingham &amp; G\u00fcler in the same position now even if we sign Karl where do we play him? \n\nI think he\u2019s somewhat really sabotaged his Bayern career. The relationship with Bayern fans is 100% gonna be broken now plus I dunno how much game time he\u2019s gonna get especially with Musiala returning. \n\nSecondly I dunno if any other club is going to come for him cause they\u2019ll know in the back of their mind his first priority will always be a move to Madrid so why bother with a player not 100% committed to their cause? \n\nMadrid &amp; Barca are the dream destinations of almost every footballer globally. But to say it publicly this early in your career at a mammoth club like Bayern. I\u2019m somewhat confused really. \n\nIt worked for Huijsen TAA &amp; Mastantuono cause we needed those profiles. Karl Idk if we at all need him. ",
