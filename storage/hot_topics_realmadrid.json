        "title": "Breakdown of the Vini saga - for those refusing to understand",
        "content": "Vini is underperforming, yes. But it's not the main reason the fans are turning on him. Some people don't want to understand that, and play the \"loyalty\" song and dance as if he's just underperforming a bit. And even if they do understand, they point fingers at other players and do the \"what about\" song and dance.\n\nLast year Vini's behavior got so bad that it directly resulted in our defences being caught out and being scored on... Losing the ball constantly due to egotistic 1v3 attempts, falling on his ass and complaining/gesticulating instead of trying to run back and helping his teammates defend a counter that HE caused.\n\nHow many times did we see an overlapping run from our LB, Vini waiting for the LB to run past him, deciding not to pass to the LB and instead running into three defenders to play the \"hero\" and prove to everyone he deserved the ballon d'Or? He of course always proceeded to lose the ball, and then our opponents had all that free space on their right wing to run into. I've seen this movie more times than I care for.\n\nHow many times have we seen him take a shot when a much better passing option was available? How many times we've seen him get into dick measuring contests with the opposing players and fans, showing \"2 CL titles\" to them etc instead of focusing on his football. More times then I care for.\n\nAfter the ballon d'or snub, he said he'll try 10x harder. He definitely tried 10x harder to make it about himself.\n\nHis presence on the pitch was obviously influenced by his need to prove that he's the guy - instead of focusing on the team's needs. Vulnerable ego, responding to all taunts and any percieved attacks. We were all forgiving for a while because he's a club legend. But after a few months of that, and no end in sight, people started looking to Carlo to perhaps bench his star or tell him to get his act together. Carlo did no such thing. Vini was untouchable.\n\nOnce Xabi came in we saw a more team oriented Vini for a while. Less rolling around on the floor, less mouthing off, higher work rate and helping out in defence. Maybe Vini didn't score a lot of goals, but we were winning as a team.\n\nThen the Classico happened and the dam had broken. Vini could no longer hold it in. He was not the star anymore and he couldn't bear the embarrassment of being taken off. Everything that happened since has been a cascade of that moment. Results started suffering at that point, Vini's attitude started stinking often etc.\n\nLoking back, seeing how there seems to be a cult built around Vini in our club, can you really blame Xabi for trying to \"stay alive\" and play it nice? Not that it helped him ultimately. \n\nThe club seems to be talking about Vini as if there's something they know that we don't. They seem to completely ignore the fact fans have a problem with a selfish attitude that hurts the team, and instead focus on \"his ability\" and coddling him to greatness again. This is extremely concerning given his contract negotiation situation, and the fact he's asking for an astronomical salary.\n\nFans were booing Vini and Florentino, and making their voices heard because of that. Fans that mostly happen to be the owners of this institution, mind you.\n\nSo when someone simplifies this whole saga to a single factor of Vini just being slightly out of form, they are being disingenuous. They support the individual over the needs of the squad. Nobody else would get such special treatment, and that's a fact.\n\nThe fact the rest of the footballing world can clearly see where the issue at Real Madrid is, while our board is doubling down is even more frustrating.\n\nThe issue is not an underperforming player. It's a self centered individual, who the club seems keen on indulging and coddling, while a massive contract extension in the works could prove to be a massive mistake from a sporting and financial standpoint.",
