Xabi has done a lot of hardwork. \nBarcelona is not looking as good as last year. Inigo's Departure and Injuries has left them vulnerable. Raphinha and Lewandowski (their best El Clasico players last year) are also not playing. \n\nLast two El Clasico, we were close, very close to winning. But it's okay, it's in the past. Only thing that matters is tomorrow. We will get the 3 points and shut all of them up.

Do you think Barca is the most stable team? We definitely have an upper hand for this match. If we cannot even win this, what will we do in the away match in may next year?",

        "content": "I'm planning a trip to Madrid with my girlfriend (a huge Real Madrid fan) centered around their match on April Wednesday 22nd. We're thinking of staying from the 21st to 27th to give us some flexibility in case the fixture gets moved to a different date - possibly that following weekend.\n\nMy main concern isn't kick-off times changing, but rather the match being rescheduled to an entirely different day. How common is this for Madrid games? Am I overthinking it, or do late-season fixtures regularly get moved around due to Champions League scheduling or domestic cup conflicts?",

        "title": "Barca Pres and then Yamal accuse Real Madrid of ref manipulation..",
        "content": "Barca Pres claimed a few days ago that somehow the blame falls on Real Madrid that Hansi Flick lost his head and made an obsene gesture at the ref, after complaining about the amount of extra time.\n\nSpecifically, the gesture is basically the Spanish (and European) version of the American middle finger at the ref. You tell me, does that not deserve a second yellow? But no, according to Barca Pres, he got the yellow because of Real Madrid.\n\nAnd now this little wet behind his ears punk echoes that ridiculous claim. Lamine Yamal is really showing what a petty and unattractive personality he's got. I understand he's still a teenager but he's over 18, acting like he's 14.\n\nYou got to feel sorry for these people. They even blamed Real Madrid for being discovered to have had a ref on their payroll. Can you imagine?\n\nOne thing that really annoys me is how Barca media constantly sane washes Barcelonas actions. Imagine if Real Madrid had a ref on their payroll, and they claimed it was for some reports. The media attacks would never stop. \n\nRecall when Real Madrid claimed that ref were biased following some insane decisions in 4 games in a row, what the media reaction was. Look at what they're claiming and the media's judged it as just quirky. And you tell me media isn't biased.\n\nApologies if there's a topic on this already.",
