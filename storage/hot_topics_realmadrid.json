Of all defensive mistakes you look in the squad, and honestly majority of it is from positioning. We need a high iq cb with incredible vision, who can position himself, not give any space to the opponent, someone who can intercept, track back, hold the defensive structure like a glue, and fit in xabis tactics.

Since today marks Vinicius' 25th birthday, I've decided to go ahead and collect all the data about his goal contributions throughout his career for **club and country.**\n\nI don't think it's a surprise seeing Barcelona topping the list since he has played so many games against them.\n\nWhat's interesting in my opinion is the fact that Liverpool and Manchester City appear on this list. This shows his great performances in big games in the UCL.\n\nNOTE: All the data has been collected by myself, I used sources such as fotmob, besoccer and flashscore. it may differ a slightly bit from what Transfermarkt shows. For example, Transfermarkt gives the player an assist if he gets fouled inside the box and his teammate scores the penalty (check Brazil-Colombia 2-1), which normally shouldn't be the case for an assist.\n\nI am  open for suggestions and recommendations on what to improve visually.",

Without Valverde in the midfield he couldn't do much.\n\nSeems like Xabi Alonso wanted to make him the playmaker of the team. He got very good vision and passing, along with a lot of distance covered and pressing. But he needs to learn how to cut off the passing lane instead of just hustle the players. The teams also needs to trust him and protect him well.",

But the amount of hate and negativity being thrown around specially towards Mbappe is a little too much. \n\nYes, he hasn\u2019t been pressing. Yes, the system is new. But let\u2019s not forget that he\u2019s only played three games(was out sick, lost 5 kgs) two off the bench. The actual season hasn\u2019t even started yet. Players are still building fitness and chemistry, and Xabi Alonso is still figuring out the system.\n\nCriticism is okay, that\u2019s a part of football. But what I\u2019m seeing isn\u2019t just criticism, it\u2019s pure hate. We wanted Mbapp\u00e9 for years, he did okay this season, and now some fans are turning on him, let's not be too quick and let Xabi have his time with him. He's arguably the best in the world currently and Xabi will get him to play that way. \n\nLet's just step back and let Xabi do his thing. ",

This setup fluidly allowed Tchouam\u00e9ni to support both midfield and defense, showcasing tactical flexibility and control. Those 2 matches makes me very excited for the future. \n\n For those who followed his work at Bayer Leverkusen, what happened after that unbeaten season? Why didn\u2019t Leverkusen maintain that same momentum in the following season? Was it injuries, transfer departures, or just the natural pressure that comes with high expectations?\n\nCurious to hear people\u2019s thoughts on both his recent performance and what went wrong after such a promising start at Leverkusen.",

        "content": "To me the biggest issue is that our midfield never has the ball against big teams. We always struggle to even get the ball in the first place so does getting a creative midfielder really fix that? But I guess that's why we're gonna be using the 3-5-2. But at the same time it's kinda crazy because all these other big teams could get the ball with only 3 midfielders so why can we never do the same?",

Give the man some time to cook before we all start losing our minds. Despite the tragic 4-0 loss, I am super excited and optimistic about next season.\n\nJust my 2 cents.

        "content": "I think we all saw the recent reports coming in that Rodrygo wants to stay at the club, I was surprised at first as he seemed to definitely be leaving due to his lack of minutes at the CWC and all the buzz surrounding his situation in the media. However I think it's starting to make more sense to me and here's why : I think Rodrygo sees the writing on the wall that Vini &amp; Mbapp\u00e9 (in their current form &amp; attitude) can't coexist, and he sees that as an opening to secure a starting spot at LW ahead of one of them. He presses, works hard on defense which is something Xabi appreciates, his numbers are low but maybe he can improve under Xabi. Vini for example also has incredibly low G/As recently compared to what we usually expect of him, and doesn't even bother to do the work off the ball - something that Rodrygo is willing to do.\n\nI'm also quite concerned about Vini's contract situation, his contract ends in 2027 and neither him or the club seem to be budging on their demands. I believe that he has no right to ask for a 30m wage while performing the way he does and the attitude he's been showing, and I think the club might force him to make a decision this summer because if he doesn't renew, next summer he'll only have 1 year left on his contract and the club would lose a lot of leverage if he were to be sold. Maybe Rodrygo is aware of this and is waiting to see how it plays out.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",
