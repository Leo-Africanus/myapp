But these are just symptoms of a deeper, long-standing problem.\n\nThe real blame lies with Florentino P\u00e9rez and the board\u2019s gross mismanagement of the squad for YEARS. For four consecutive seasons, it\u2019s been painfully obvious that we lack depth and quality in both central and lateral defense. Injuries, form drops, and age have exposed us again and again\u2014and what does the board do? They chase strikers.\n\nStrikers. Every. Single. Window.\n\nInstead of reinforcing the spine of the team, we\u2019re flooded with attacking options while our backline crumbles. Lucas V\u00e1zquez shouldn\u2019t be a go-to right back. Vallejo shouldn\u2019t be in a Real Madrid squad. But they are\u2014not because of Ancelotti, but because the club\u2019s sporting project has been mediocre at best.\n\nAncelotti is not blameless\u2014he\u2019s stuck in the past tactically, and his choices have cost us games\u2014but let\u2019s not fool ourselves. He\u2019s the scapegoat for a structurally flawed squad built by a board that refuses to prioritize balance and sustainability over star power and headlines.\n\nFlorentino P\u00e9rez gets the praise when things go right. He must take the fall when things go wrong.\n",

It\u2019s not just about individual quality\u2014they control the tempo, dictate the flow, and we look lost.\n\nI even saw Barella look solid against them in just 2 matches.

        "title": "Why Did Carlo choose to abandon balance and control in the midfield?",
        "content": "Remember the first El Cl\u00e1sico and beginning of the season? He tried to put Valverde in the middle for Kroos job. Even Jude was put to the right and it failed badly. Valverde is not a DLP, he could not control tempo. Even his defense works better on the right instead of middle.\n\nCeballos seems to be the right choice in the middle of the season, but Carlo once again abandoned it in the Super Cup and we lost horribly, the midfield was non existent.\n\nIn the 1st Arsenal game, he chose to let Valverde to go middle again instead of Guler, and put Vasquez on when Modric was subbed off, we lost control once again. Vasquez was destroyed, and the midfield was broken, all you can see is long pass.\n\n2nd leg started with NO playmaker, and the midfield was broken as well, we got nearly no chance before Modric and Ceballos came on. I was very surprised by it. He was asked about would he make any changes with 2nd chance he said no.\n\nThis game AGAIN. He put Valverde in the middle and Guler on the right, it was all wrong, we got no control, the right side was being destroyed. It should have been Guler in the middle to control and Valverde on the right to protect Vasquez.\n\nBarca was playing with 3 passing midfield in recent games but they could overrun ours with their pressure/passing. \n\nAlso why did he put Endrick in the right winger when Mbappe was on the field?",

This was the 3 peat Zidane team that ruled UCl. \n\nSo, me being curious, wanted to see how close we were to winning lost la liga titled. 15/16 was a close margin, makes sense, but 17/18 was 17 points?? How does a team lose the league by 17 points and then comfortably win the ucl final ",
