Yeah, he knows what to do with the ball, but under pressure he crumbles. He has no physical and he gets bullied of the ball easily. Then we have Alaba, Ceballos, and Mendy who just occupy space on the bench or in the hospital. When it comes to actual World Class players we only have two, Courtouis and Mbappe. How did we get to the point where we need to overhaul midfield, defense and the right wing? Our situation will not start to change until we get rid of players who bring nothing, and start bringing PROVEN players. Not some 17 year old South American, but someone who we know for a fact is good. The fact we did not even try to get Guehi still haunts me, and we dropped 60 on mastantuono, crazy. ",

It's a joke, it's always Courtois and he always speaks truthfully, analyticaly and being self-critical. \n\nHe's the only one with the experience and maturity (apart from Carvajal but he never plays) to actually lead this team.\n\nThen again...

Regarding this statement, I couldn\u2019t agree more. Even though Mbappe has his flaws, he is showing up to play every game and is the reason we are where we are. Him and Courtois, no matter how bad of a game they have, will always have my respect. Regarding on what he said, we have been lacking grit and desire. We are also extremely inconsistent. Ever since the 4-0 loss to psg at the cwc, Madrid had found something that clicked at the beginning of the season. Everyone was pressing, we were winning games, playing good football, and until that altercation between Xabi and Vini, all came downhill. Xabi wasn\u2019t the problem and it\u2019s obvious, the players are. A \u201cteam of champions\u201d doesn\u2019t kick out a manger and does what they want. This team badly needs to rebuild not only physically but also mentally and gain a lot more maturity and the hunger to win again. ",
