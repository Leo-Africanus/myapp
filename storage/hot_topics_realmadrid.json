        "title": "La Liga: The Most \u201cElite\u201d Amateur League in the World",
        "content": "Honestly, how does La Liga still market itself as one of the top leagues in the world when every week there's another scandal?\n\n**Referee scandals everywhere** \u2013 First the Negreira case, where Barcelona paid a former referees\u2019 official for \u201cconsulting\u201d over years. And the story of a ref whose company allegedly had business ties with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, or another ref who had a painting of Messi on his garden wall. And of course, there\u2019s supposedly no conflict of interest, and the fact that these refs keep making the most questionable decisions against Madrid is just a coincidence. And those were just two of the bigger scandals from last season that involved Real Madrid. Every single week there are smaller controversies \u2014 and bigger ones affecting other teams too \u2014 with absolutely no sign of things improving anytime soon.\n\n**No goal-line technology in 2025** \u2013 Every other major league solved this problem a decade ago. Meanwhile in Spain, you\u2019re still relying on VAR guesswork and dodgy camera angles to decide if a ball crossed the line in billion-euro competitions.\n\n**Offside tech behind the times** \u2013 The Premier League uses thicker lines to account for the 2\u20135 cm margin of error in frame rates and calibration. La Liga? Paper-thin lines and decisions made down to a single pixel, even though the technology itself admits it isn\u2019t that precise. Just look at Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s goal in the last match \u2014 it was clearly onside. How can anyone in this league seriously rule a player offside by 1 mm when experts agree the system has a 2\u20135 cm error margin?\n\n**And sometimes, VAR just\u2026 \"doesn\u2019t work\"** - Somehow, in 2025, there are still games where VAR goes completely offline for \"technical reasons\", leaving clubs in billion-euro competitions at the mercy of human error like it\u2019s 1995.\n\n**Home advantage? Let\u2019s sell it to the US** \u2013 Instead of fixing officiating or infrastructure, La Liga wants to stage league games in the United States, stripping smaller clubs of one of the only equalizers they have: home turf advantage.\n\nCorruption scandals, outdated technology, decisions made with zero regard for sporting fairness, and bizarre scheduling issues \u2014 this league needs a complete overhaul before it can even be called professional. But Tebas seems to care more about money than about \u201cunnecessary\u201d things like fairness and integrity.\n\n**\"This isn\u2019t football. This is La Liga.\"**",

Just look at how he handled his potential transfer to Liverpool all summer, continuing to put his head down and playing til the last game for crystal palace. If we can get him for free, I know this guy is not the type to come in demanding Alaba-like wages. I regularly watch the prem and I\u2019m a big fan. Would love to see this. \n",

Bellingham should play as a CM, while G\u00fcler plays higher up as the AM to avoid being bullied physically deeper. This setup gives us both ball control and defensive stability.

Ideally, i think the best lineup we would have at our disposal is the current defense, midfield of tchoumeni, valverde and Arda and an attack of Bellingham, Mbappe and Vini. I think that playing Bellingham in the central role would be perfect for our team to utilize those dangerous crosses from Trent(we don't have any attackers in the box when we cross) . Also, bellingham can play as a CM when arda or valverde is pushing high. Mbappe being Mbappe will thrive on either side of the wing and we also know what vinicius is capable of when he is in form . Also when we play a high pressing team , we can switch Arda for Ceballos as the closet player we have that is press resistant and control the tempo is him.  There are so many qualities and depth right now in our team I fear there will be problems in the dressing room due to the lack of playing time once everyone is fit. What do you guys think?",

The little intricate plays in tight spaces, the runs, the passing, movement and swagger this club has been known for feels like it's coming back and that was show in the marcelo like passing from Trent, the Ronaldo like chop from Vini and the ramos esque passing from Dean. \n\nThe results are obviously vital and very important but I urge the fanbase to give Xabi and the players time, let them cook and to support them when they eventually struggle but I believe sooner rather than later we will become a dominant force again.\n\nHala Madrid!",

        "content": "The video criticizes the lack of decision and his lack of offensive effort without the ball.\n\nI think it's because of Mbappe's goalscoring instinct.  During the whole action he only thought about how he could score a goal himself.He was waiting for Vini to pass to the left so he could receive a cross and score.You don't score so many goals without having a great goalscoring instinct (32 goals in 35 matches is incredible).\n\nBut the problem is that he didn't think for a second that he wasn't the other 4 options during the counterattack:\nIf he had made a call to the left it could have created space for the player on the right \nIf he made a call to the right it would have created space for the player on the left \nIf he makes a call at the start of the action (vini seemed to be waiting for that) he could have been served in depth \nOr even Vini could have had plenty of space if the defenders misunderstood each other during Mbappe's deep run. \n\nI guess he thinks like that because he was often the only serious attacking option at PSG (Neymar was very often injured and Messi scored 7 goals during his first season at PSG) It would be good for the team if he made more offensive effort without the ball, I mean vini's goal is almost lucky (his luck = talent)\n\nAnd a question for the moderators: is it forbidden to make posts to talk about tactics outside of live matches? I mean one of my posts was deleted for no reason even though I just talked about tactics and was respectful/didn't insult anyone/no swear words/nothing +18\n\nIf it's forbidden for you, it would be cool to remove the ban, We always get better football analyses when we're not in the emotion of the live match.",
