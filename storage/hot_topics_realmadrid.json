        "content": "Carlo Ancelotti gave his final pre-match press conference while still in charge of the club, speaking at Valdebebas before the La Liga clash with Real Sociedad on Saturday. Speaking about those who will follow him, he said, \n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t want to give advice, everyone has their own methodology. But enjoy Real Madrid. Xabi Alonso will be the first and I wish him all the luck in the world. He has the quality to coach Real Madrid. Let him enjoy it, that\u2019s what I have to say.\u201d\n\nElaborating further on whether his departure marked the end of an era, he added that, \n&gt; \u201cyou may think that a golden generation is coming to an end, with Modri\u0107. Although Carvajal is missing. But this generation, like everything else, must end at some point. And many have left: Casemiro, Cristiano Ronaldo... and Real Madrid continued, as it will continue, to be the best club in the world.\u201d\n\nAncelotti on how special his farewell will be\n\n&gt; \u201cVery, it is inevitable. It is my last game. Always, when an era comes to an end there is a lot of emotion. And this is happening to me. But I am not sad, not at all, but very happy. I have tried to do my best and we leave here happy and content, because sooner or later... this had to happen. Thank you for this time: players, club, president... we have had a great time during this time, I have had a great time. With much affection, help and grateful for the opportunity to coach spectacular players. This period is coming to an end, it has been quite long, but it has ended well. I have never argued with the president and I never will. Not on the last day either. So far, so good. And a new era begins, to which I go with the same enthusiasm with which I arrived here. It has been a successful period, we have won a lot and I consider that holding more than 700 press conferences with you is also a success! We have had a good time. But putting up with 700 press conferences... I don\u2019t think it has been so easy. Some questions have not always been nice.\u201d\n\nAncelotti on his final training session\n\n&gt; \u201cIt will be as it should be. A very nice one. As I said, these are exciting days, you talk with the players... and with so many people. My relationship with everyone has been very good and I appreciate the atmosphere: cooks, those who made me carbonara before the games, I thank everyone. I thank everyone. These are special days, but I have not done anything new.\u201d\n\nAncelotti on his emotions in the final game\n\n&gt; \u201cYes, I get excited very quickly. It\u2019s going to be an exciting day. If I cry, there is no problem. It will be nice and I share it with Modri\u0107... who has been a spectacular support in this era at Real Madrid. Someone fantastic, a legend. It will be nice to say goodbye with him.\u201d\n\nAncelotti on the club paying tribute to him\n\n&gt; \u201cI am proud to have had the opportunity to coach this club. The success of everything I have achieved since 2013 is there. I want to say goodbye with the affection I have for the club.\u201d\n\nAncelotti on his best night at the Bernab\u00e9u\n\n&gt; \u201cBufff, there have been many, many! It is very difficult to choose one. But I\u2019ll go for the comebacks, because they are things that are still unexplained. I\u2019ll remember, above all, those ones. PSG, Manchester City and Chelsea. They will always be unforgettable.\u201d\n\nAncelotti on the transition to lead Brazil\n\n&gt; \u201cThe feeling is very nice, very much so. I\u2019m very excited to have the opportunity to not betray Real Madrid with any other club and go to the national team with the most history, the five-time champions. It\u2019s a great challenge, but I love being able to prepare for a World Cup with Brazil.\u201d\n\nAncelotti on how he\u2019d like to be remembered\n\n&gt; \u201cAs a good coach, obviously. But time will tell. At this moment, even as I say goodbye, I feel the affection of many people and that makes me very happy... and very happy.\u201d\n\nAncelotti on if he\u2019d return to Madrid after Brazil\n\n&gt; \u201cThese are things I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t feel like coaching another club, or I didn\u2019t, after Real Madrid. That\u2019s what I have said and I maintain. In the future... I don\u2019t know. But the most immediate thing is to do well with Real Madrid.\u201d\n\nAncelotti on how the game has changed since he arrived\n\n&gt; \u201cIt has changed, it has changed. And I saw that if I didn\u2019t adapt, I wouldn\u2019t win any more Champions League titles. But in this second chapter I have been helped by a young coaching staff, with enthusiasm and a desire to learn. Preparing a match now is much more analytical than before. There are a lot of aspects that 20 years ago were not taken into account. But I have had a coaching staff, as I said, that has given me the enthusiasm to evolve. I am different now from 1995 and from 2013.\u201d\n\nAncelotti on what Real Madrid needs to change\n\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t want to go into this. As I said: the club has all the tools to be competitive next year, and this will always be Real Madrid\u2019s objective. Tomorrow I say goodbye to Modri\u0107... who has been an example for everyone. And for a coach, to have someone like him... because there are many players with a lot of quality, but he has been able to make quality compatible with soul. And that\u2019s made him a Real Madrid legend. This is very important. When you are able to combine the two, you are a legend. And when you can\u2019t, you are a normal player.\u201d\n\nAncelotti on whether he has any regrets\n\n&gt; \u201cNo, no. I know I\u2019ve made a lot of mistakes, a lot of them; but since I\u2019ve made so many, I can\u2019t tell you which one has affected me the most. But nothing has kept me awake at night.\u201d\n\nAncelotti on how he\u2019d like to be thought of as a coach\n \n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t know... I don\u2019t know... My work can be judged, there is no problem. But I am not a coach, I am a person who does the job of coach. There will be those who think better or worse of my work, that\u2019s fine. But I don\u2019t want to be remembered as a bad person.\u201d",

        "content": "It feels so sad to see Modric leaving. It just hurts on a personal level. \nLuka Modric did everything he could to stay in the club. He offered to lower his salary and waited till the last moment for the management to provide him an extension. Even Xabi wanted Modric next season. No rumour from any other clubs, no proposal. He was always loyal to this club. \nAs a Madrid fan since day one, it really hurts and frustrating  to see how Real Madrid treat their legends. \nModric really deserved one year extension and retire at Madrid after the World Cup 26.",

        "content": "We all remember the early days - how Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior dazzled everyone with his pace, dribbling, and flair, often doing the hardest part by beating defenders with ease, only to falter at the finish or make the wrong decision in the final third. There was raw talent, but also inconsistency.\n\nThat\u2019s where Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s impact has been transformative. Under his guidance, Vini has matured significantly. Ancelotti didn\u2019t just give him confidence - he brought structure to his game. He helped channel Vini's energy more efficiently, improved his decision-making, and gave him the tactical awareness needed at the top level.\n\nNow, Vini still excites with his creativity, but he\u2019s also become clinical, more composed under pressure, and consistently delivers in big moments. Credit to Ancelotti for recognizing the potential and patiently polishing a rough diamond into one of the most feared attackers in world football today.",

        "content": "I just have really big need to write something about our maestro Luka.\n\nI've been Real Madrid and GNK Dinamo Zagreb (Lukita's academy club) fan my whole life and since I am Croatian you can only imagine how saddening this feels. \n\nI was always mad when departures at the club were happening, I know that I was furious when Higuain left, I remember when Ozil left and it potentially opened \"space\" for Lukita. Year after year someone was leaving and after everything I said to myself - if Perez is making bold move it is always because of someone else and something bigger. I wasn't sad when CR7, Ramos, Casemiro, Kroos left because I was telling myself that same thing. But this... this really hurts.\n\nI remember when he came to Real, I was just in middle school... Me and my older brothet were watching every game. I vividly remember game vs ManU where Lukita scored screamer. \n\nHow he played at Real, time passed, new players came, we witnessed the best era of the club. Continuosly I was growing older with Real, with all the players that came and went (do you even remember Illaramendi or infamous Copa del Rey Cheryshev saga anymore?). 13 years later, I am no longer in middle school, I finished college and it feels like it happened in a blink of an eye.\n\nI am forever grateful for having the opportunity to watch him in national jersey at the big EURO stage and last month visiting Madrid 1st time in my life and attending the game at Santiago Bernabeu while Maestro was wearing captain armband.\n\nFor me this is not just farewell, this is understanding that time passes extremely fast and we are all getting older each and every second.\n\nThank you Luka, thank you el capitan, thank you for everything!\n\n(If this post breaks community rules delete it but I had need to write something.)",
