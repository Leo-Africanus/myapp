The only player who actually kept trying to do something while everyone else looked like they were young highschool boys ready for bed. Very unfortunate considering that he is finally NEARLY back to his old self and could have potentially scored more goals, yet no one was there to back him up! This was supposed to be a huge game. How in the hell did we not have a proper plan?? \n\nMidfield and especially our NON-EXISTENT defense line in shambles! Embarrassing.\n\nAncelotti is very stubborn keeping his favourite boys in Starting XI and refusing to sub when we have a very talented stacked bench players waiting the whole game. He should be shown the door and take Lucas, Tchou and Mendy out with him. Useless coach.\n\n\n\n",

Today he was the best! He has had 20 ucl knockout goals in 30 games (6th highest overall and the most at his age) and 8 wc knockout goals in 8 games (Highest wc knockout goals tied with the legendary r9) with 4 coming in the finals. \n\nIt was around this age, when ronaldo started to explode in champions league scoring goals for fun and lots of them in the knockout stages. Can mbappe do the same for us? I mean he has scored 3 goals in 3 finals for us already. He has had his lows for us but to be fair it was a new league and team for his and he clearly needed time adjusting.",

This totals to almost entire half time to score 3 goals against the team that has 1 player less. \n\nWe used to do come back against the prime City and PSG in much less minutes with equal number of players. \n\nTonight, players were lost and desperately needed some tactical plan. Funnily enough, Ancelotti is almost proudly stating that he is making no any plans. \n\nIn addition, players were showing passion no matter what. Tonight, nobody cared apart from few. And that is happening when players have guaranteed spot no matter what. Regardless how they play, they will play the next game, too. \n\nI would understand forcing some yougsters to unlock their potential and make the future for them and club. But Ancelotti is trying hard with Vasquez and Mendy like they are 17. For different reasons, he plays Tchouameni cause they payed him 80millions. He must play even as a goalkeeper, he must play. \n\nLastly, Carlo is not 40, he know he has no future as a coach at Real Madrid anymore. He should just leave and make fans happy. This is ridiculous what he is doing. He should have left last season. He knew we were not playing well since he came, and that we won what we won on individual brilliance and luck\n",

        "content": "Everyone of us is fucking mad. Losing a Clasico happens, but what, now we are back to conceding 4 and 5 goals in a single game against Barcelona in just 4 months ? What's next until we know we need re-structuring in defense ? Maybe conceding 8 goals in the away game in La Liga will help ? \n\nThe tough tests this season were BVB, Barcelona, Liverpool and Milan.. we won only against BVB, and credits goes to the team but Nuri Sahin poor management and parking the bus early helped a lot. The rest of the teams had good wingers, and they all cooked our fullbacks, Mendy, a once every 2 seasons, top defensive player, and... Lucas Vazquez..\n\nAgain he starts. I get that the goals weren't FULLY on him, as Tchou is no Maldini and today, even Rudiger was out of place, and neither Cama or Valverde covered that CDM spot... but he keeps proving every game against good wingers that he can't defend for his life unless Rodrygo or Valverde helps him... that space in between him and Tchouameni became a popular tourist destination for opposite team forwards... \n\nHe is a fucking backup and him doing good against Pachuca and Getafe and Las Palmas doesn't mean he will do good against wingers like Raphinha... are the Castilla players that bad ? I don't know who is the starting RB there, but if Asencio got promoted, maybe I am missing something and the Castilla RB is not a good fit either ? If not.. are we fucking broke or something ? Can't we loan a RB at least ? a physical RB ? \n\nI defended Tchouameni and Ancelotti's decision.. but he is no Maldini that justifies benching Asencio, who in every minute he plays, he proves he is very elegant and can handle his own, in areal duals and tackling and he is even pretty fast... even his passing and build up is good.. I don't know what Tchouameni did this season to deserve to get ahead. I remember the 'best' game he had against Girona, that's it. \n\nAlso why the fuck Ceballos was benched today ? We have been shit in the midfield despite having all those big names stacked next to each other and HE was the one who fixed the build up, linking our defense and midfield and forwards. He does the easy and chill job of passes forward, with the least dribbling and ball holding. He is no Kroos but he is the closest to filling his place... we improved a lot since he started, but today, for some reason, Ancelotti decided long balls is the answer and he shouldn't start... very questionable.\n\nNow to our starters... something is off even with the player with the monstrous mentality today, Bellingham. He looked like he didn't care at all. He is usually a leader on the pitch, but today, he wasn't good. He was consistent and carried us countless times together with Rudiger. It still hurts that the one bad game they have is in a title final and against Bar\u00e7a... \n\nVinicius needs to fucking focus. Did it get to his head that he is the 'best' player and everything is a conspiracy against him after CR7 told him you're the best ? He let his team down to 10 men after being provoked by Valencia players, almost costing us 3 important points, then the Mallorca game, he gets involved in the fight even though he is in the bench, and today, he was nowhere to be seen.\n\nModric pulled us through in the Valencia game, but today he was very clumsy. worst sub.\n\nWorst game for Bellingham and Rudiger since they were signed too.\n\nPerez, please. Like I said in another post a couple of months ago, he decided that Ancelotti will always find the answer with the 'available' players just because he made it work when Benzema left and use Jude as false 9. Buy us a fucking RB. the La Liga teams that succeeded in beating and drawing against Barcelona also had to deal with Raphinha.. We are making Barcelona look like prime Brazil ! Every fucking time ! We conceded 9 goals in two games ! FUCK OFF Perez and buy some fucking right back ! I won't even be mad if he under performs, at least he is a right back ! ",

        "content": "This is arguably one of the worst performances that I\u2019ve ever seen from our boys. Tactically, defensively, offensively, we got humbled everywhere. How about we stop thinking about this too much when the issue is right in front of our eyes? \n\nI firmly believe that Ancelotti\u2019s time is up. Now listen, I don\u2019t want to be another Ancelotti hater and be ungrateful for what the Don has given us ever since his first term in 2014, but enough is enough. Ancelotti doesn\u2019t want to listen, he doesn\u2019t want to use simplicity when the answer is right in front of his eyes. His first mistake was starting Tchouameni over Asencio. Raul has been phenomenal for Real Madrid, he has shown that he wants to fight for the badge, his place as a starter and that he absolutely loves being a Madridista. His performances when starting for the club have been phenomenal and everyone in this subreddit has witnessed that. So tell me, how can Carlo Ancelotti see such a gem and bench him for a midfielder that isn\u2019t a center back in the first place? Tchouameni helped us at the back when Nacho was injured last season, but this season, it\u2019s not working. He clearly lacks the fundamentals of being a center back, something that Asencio doesn\u2019t. Ancelotti has a real center back but he doesn\u2019t want to play him? Second mistake is the game plan. What is our game plan? What are the tactics? It\u2019s like Ancelotti doesn\u2019t want to learn from his mistakes after the humiliation we suffered in the last classico, 4-0. Hansi Flick taught our coach a lesson twice and still, nothing has changed. \n\nI\u2019ve talked about our board in one of my previous posts here and that same board will be the topic of today\u2019s post as well. I am tired of seeing Lucas Vazquez play as our RB when Carvajal is injured. What did the board think when they saw that we only had one RB and one RW turned RB? That the Madrid DNA would help? That because we won the UCL last season, everything would be okay? Since when Real Madrid, the biggest club in the world, relied on some mundane thoughts or even on feelings? It\u2019s clear and obvious that Vazquez is defensively suspect. In the Intercontinental Cup, he was getting cooked by players that most people didn\u2019t know until they played Real Madrid. Any good winger gets the better off him and it\u2019s the second time against Barcelona that he gets outplayed because of his poor marking, his poor positioning and his poor defensive actions. Saying that \u201coh we don\u2019t need to buy any player, we\u2019re satisfied with our squad\u201d when our fullbacks are defensively suspect is insanity.\n\nReally, really disappointed in today\u2019s loss. We couldn\u2019t show a good image, some players played like they never kicked a ball in their lives and again, we let the opponent play their football without playing ours. I know that I\u2019m not the one to talk since I\u2019m only a fan watching the team play, but I love this club with all my heart so I cannot stay quiet when I look at such a disastrous performance. This club needs to be rebuilt, it needs a new project and Ancelotti will not be apart of our new project. At the end of the season, if the Don understands and respects the club, he needs to leave.",

        "title": "A post-debacle, level-headed analysis",
        "content": "Right off the bat, that game was one of the worst showings this team has had, maybe since the 0-5 with Mourinho. Yes, Ancelotti made a bunch of mistakes that are hard to understand, but he is the best coach Madrid has had since Del Bosque, helped cement the history-making squad, and then helped the team transition out of that generation. He has a whole season-long pass from me (and all those calling him names and for his head here\u2026 your age is showing.)\n\nOk, that said \u2014 there are some real, glaring, fixable problems in this team:\n\nValverde needs to be RB, simple as that. I love and appreciate all Lucas has done for us, but he\u2019s just not up to snuff anymore, this game showed it in every single way, and the season\u2019s about to get hot. We can mitigate losing him in the middle, but we absolutely cannot afford the hole in the RB.\n\nTchouameni isn\u2019t actually a CB option. The guy has been on thin ice with me for some time, but at this point I don\u2019t even think I can take stock of his value because he is in a position that\u2019s extra vulnerable this season, and is just not his. Asencio has done enough to offset for his youth and at this point in the season, is just giving more confidence than Tchouameni in every facet of the game.\n\nIt\u2019s painfully obvious this team is lacking a talented LB, and while someone gets signed we need to play the better defender, pin him to start, and make him just focus on defending.\n\nVinicius can\u2019t be an untouchable until late in the game (especially in big games!!!) He was a ghost the majority of the game, and one of the few right decisions Carlo made today was to sub him off for Brahim. Our Bench has ideas and actually offers alternatives that we can\u2019t ignore just so we can keep our chips on Plan A. \n\n\nThe best cure for this team\u2019s defense is two CDMs, we have the squad for it, we just need to accept it and play that game. We need to play Xmas tree and not 4-3-3 so that our defense gets more help and we can still afford some liberties to our attackers. Ceballos is having one of his best seasons and this would harness that, too. \n\nLastly, this team (and most importantly, these fans and this sub) need to accept that we might not win anything this season, and that is not the end of the world. We lost Kroos, we lost a starting CB, a starting RB (who\u2019s also the team captain), and we\u2019ve spent 3 months adapting a mega talent - and might I say, he\u2019s starting to gel with the team!!! It\u2019s ok if we have a blank, restart season. Some of our best periods have followed blank seasons before. (la D\u00e9cima followed Mou\u2019s last year, the treble followed the 2015 season where everything fell apart): these things happen, especially at Real, we\u2019ll survive.",

        "content": "This isn't the solution. Playing Valverde as a right back might seem like a quick fix since he's miles ahead of Lucas V\u00e1zquez in that role, but we need to stop forcing players to play out of position instead of addressing the need through proper signings.  \n\nWhy settle for being a decent right back when you can be a world class midfielder? Players may be willing to sacrifice for the team, but they're not happy playing out of position, and it affects their mental state.\nMore importantly, it stunts their growth and momentum when they're stuck in an unfamiliar role for too long.  \n\nI'm not here to defend Tchouam\u00e9ni, he has been underperforming game after game, but I believe he was on the right track before Carlo started using him as a center back. Now that he's played more games as a CB than in his natural position, not only is he ineffective defensively, but he also seems to have lost his edge in midfield.  \n\nFor young players, especially those who have only been at Madrid for a few seasons, it's crucial to develop in their natural positions. These players need time to find their rhythm, build confidence, and fully evolve into their roles. Playing them out of position disrupts that process and risks wasting their potential.  \n\nAnother big issue is that by constantly forcing players to play out of position, we enable P\u00e9rez to continue avoiding the squad's actual needs. This approach only gives him confidence to stick with patchwork solutions instead of making the signings we desperately need. It reminds me of how our two recent UCL wins gave him the excuse to overlook the cracks in the squad, leaving alot of issues unaddressed.  \n\nIf we want long-term success, we need proper squad planning and players who are allowed to thrive in their natural roles before desperately playing them out of position without much choice on their part.
