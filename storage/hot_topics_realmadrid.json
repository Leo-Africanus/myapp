Corner cleared awkwardly by Cristian David, and Resende fires the rebound under the bar... Castilla's free fall without Arbeloa continues... \n\n\u274c\u26bd 90'+6 - after a very very long revision, the goal is disallowed for passive offside by the player who is right behind Cristian before he clears the ball so badly. If it was offside, it's a correct decision, but they only showed the main camera perspective so it is impossible to tell from that angle\n\nFT - a fight of a football match with 10 yellow cards on a muddy football field comes to an end - Castilla showed good attitude today, but struggle to find the way back to the controlling nature they had under Arbeloa. In the end Fran needed to save the team twice and a lucky and close VAR revision made sure it stays at 0:0. 3 draws and 1 loss under Julian L\u00f3pez so far, with this form, Castilla will not be able to finish the season in the playoff spots\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 12:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Municipal de Pasar\u00f3n, Pontevedra \n\n**Referee**: \n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 1, Matchday 23\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[LaLiga+](https://www.laligaplus.laliga.com/) (subscription - 14.99\u20ac/month) (only available in Spain)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-3-3): Fran Gonz\u00e1lez - V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as \u2018Valde\u2019 (82' Liberto Navascu\u00e9s), Mario Rivas, Joan Mart\u00ednez, Jes\u00fas Fortea - Cristian David, Manuel \u00c1ngel, Thiago Pitarch (54' Diego Aguado) - C\u00e9sar Palacios (82' \u00c1lvaro Leiva), Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga (62' Adri\u00e1n Arnuncio 'Arnu'), Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (62' Pol Fortuny)\n\nBench: Guille S\u00fanico (GK), Lamini Fati, Dani Mesonero, Bruno Iglesias. \n\nUnavailable: David Jim\u00e9nez (first team call-up), Manu Serrano (injury), Jorge Cestero (first team call-up), Roberto Mart\u00edn (injury), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Rachad Fettal (injury). \n\nCoach: Juli\u00e1n L\u00f3pez de Lerma\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** WLDLD\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 9th | 33pt | 10-3-9 | 29:31\n",

Because of the fact he is in this position, I feel he has a lot more area to cover or \"walk around in.\" \n\nBecause of this, I feel like he makes less runs back. When I watched him as a LW at the start and early years of his career, he did actually contribute a little defensively. \n\nThis makes me want to see Vini left, Garcia CF and Mbappe right more than ever. When Mbappe has to work harder for his goals, a lot of his 'bad' qualities may automatically disappear. ",

        "content": "I couldn\u2019t be more grateful for his contributions. It\u2019s not a mystery that our current guys relied on Kroos and Modric. With that being said, our legends equally relied on the younger guys as they aged. Kroos impact was big enough that there\u2019s no need to diminish what the other guys did just to prop him up.\n\nTalking about the great 2024 season specifically. We wouldn\u2019t have been as successful without Jude sense of goal, Valverde being the engine he was, and Tchouameni\u2019s defensive stability. Camavinga, Modric, and Brahim also played their role perfectly off the bench. Obviously Kroos being the controller that he was played a significant role. The board clearly failed to replace his profile, and things fell apart shortly after. If the others suddenly left without being replaced, we wouldn\u2019t be as good either. Again, there\u2019s no need to discredit their contributions.\n\nA part of me will always be happy that Kroos retired on top, and Modric gets to dominate in Italy. There\u2019s no doubt that people in this sub would be hating on them too if things stopped going well. You could start to see it in 2023. Fans would beg Carlo to play the younger guys over them. Calling Kross &amp; Modric too old and slow to compete against the top teams. It\u2019s funny how the tables turn. Now the younger guys are \u201cunworthy\u201d / not \u201cReal Madrid caliber\u201d players.",

        "content": "Based off the discourse in this subreddit, I\u2019m not sure if people are aware, but we did win the Champions League in 2024. To give this some context: this is the 70th rendition of the UCL. Assuming we don\u2019t win this year, we will have won the UCL about once every 5 years. The second winningest club, AC Milan, will have won once every 10. Barca has not made it to the UCL final in over a decade. There are currently 17 players on our roster who have won the UCL with Real Madrid. They did not win due to coincidence.\n\nWe had a bad year last year due to the departure of some major players, and the addition of a new major component who has been more challenging to adapt to. This year we had a coach who, for whatever reason, did not work out. I think that the pessimism and dooming that has become so common is unfair to the current players, many of who have been instrumental in winning us 2 UCLs, a feat any other club would go crazy for. Unfair to the leadership of the club who for a decade and a half have been overseeing the most successful era in the history not of this club, but of this sport. And unfair to Arbeloa, a coach who was very successful during his stint in the youth teams, a man who sided with CR7 and Mourinho during a tumultuous time that ended up defining the next decade, and a new figure for the club who should be met with excitement and optimism but is instead greeted with bitterness due to feelings about the exit of his predecesor.\n\nI still believe that the leadership of this club which has been so successful knows what they are doing. I believe that the players who have won us more in the last 5 years than most do in their whole careers will win for us again. While I am saddened by how Xabi\u2019s stint turned out, I believe in Arbeloa as a man and as a manager. Above all, I believe in Real Madrid\u2019s ability to come back when everything is stacked against us and all but Madridistas have lost hope. ",

        "title": "Why Toni Kroos was the greatest midfielder",
        "content": "Hello everyone, I know this title will have many in doubts, but let me explain. In this story I want to show you some of the numbers of Toni Kroos, which no one see's. I would say, Kroos forces the game being played like he wants it. I will go through different statistics and give you also some comparable other players stats as well. The values inside the tables are all rounded just for readability, but this doesn't change anything for the facts!\n\n1. Pass volume &amp; accuracy (2017 - 2023)\n\n* **Pass volume** = total attempted passes\n* **Pass accuracy** = percentage of successful passes\n\n|Name|Passing Volume|Passing Accuracy|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Sergio Busqusts|18.300|90|\n|Toni Kroos|18.700|90|\n|Joshua Kimmich|19.800|85|\n|Rodri|20.000|92|\n\nThey are the top 4, the best of the best and what can see? Toni Kroos is not number 1, but don't stop reading yet!\n\n2. Ball contacts before losing the ball\n\n* **Touches per ball loss** = how many touches a player makes before losing the ball\n* **Minutes played** = total minutes played (2017\u20132023)\n\n|Name|Minutes Played|Touches per ball loss|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Joshua Kimmich|23.300|57|\n|Rodri|23.500|67|\n|Sergio Busquets|23.000|78|\n|Toni Kroos|20.800|95|\n\nThis metrics doesn't look to relevant, but it gives us one important information. No matter what game situation you're in - you could pass to Kroos and he could calm the situation for you. In average Toni Kroos losses the ball after touching it 95 times before. However this could bring up the idea, he is just playing safe and doesn't take risks. Wrong!\n\n3. Progressions per ball loss\n\n* **Progressions per ball loss** = how many forward/progressive actions a player makes before losing the ball\n* **Minutes played** = total minutes played (2017\u20132023)\n\n|Name|Minutes Played|Progressions per ball lose|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Joshua Kimmich|23.300|12|\n|Rodri|23.500|12|\n|Sergio Busquets|23.000|15|\n|Toni Kroos|20.800|23|\n\nThis table shows us, that Toni Kroos is not just a player that hides, has a lot of touches and doesn't do anything with it. He is still creating more progression than any of his competitors with having also a comfortable lead. However progression doesn't always mean dangerous, that's what we will look at next.\n\n4. Passes into final third\n\n* **Passes into final third** = number of passes played into the attacking third\n* **Minutes played** = total Champions League minutes (2017\u20132023)\n\n|Name|Minutes Played|Passes into final third|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Luka Modric|5.700|500|\n|Rodri|5.000|510|\n|Joshua Kimmich|7.500|660|\n|Toni Kroos|5.800|740|\n\nDespite him being the safest midfielder of all time, he is also the most dangerous creator of all time - since UCL 2003. While we were waiting for Cristiano, Vini Jr. and everyone else scoring goals, Kroos was the one directing the game into the dangerous zones. He didn't wait for the moment, he created it - for more than a decade.\n\nTaken together, the data shows why Toni Kroos was indispensable to Real Madrid\u2019s success: with unmatched passing accuracy, ball security, progression efficiency, and elite volume of passes into the final third, he consistently controlled games while advancing play with minimal risk\u2014turning dominance in possession into sustained attacking pressure.\n\nIn case you've read everything, please tell me your opinion and have a great day!",

        "content": "This Real Madrid doesn\u2019t work. That I think we can all agree on. Then I hear some blaming Vini, some Mbappe, others remembering Kroos and Luka and many looking at Florentino. How divided we are as fans is a reflection of how complex are Madrid\u2019s problems.\n\nSo here\u2019s my hot take:\n\nMadrid and Florentino haven\u2019t outgrown the phase where they can just buy players and simply trust top world talent with a people manager. It worked with the generation of CR7, Modric, Kroos, Ramos, etc. It didn\u2019t with the galacticos, and now it\u2019s not working again.\n\nIn today\u2019s world, with state owned clubs and both money and talent pouring into the Premier League, this approach is much harder - we just can\u2019t compete financially or as the attractive top league we were 10 years ago, and it\u2019s starting to show. \n\nWe can\u2019t easily buy top talent like we did before. Zidane was signed in months, CR7 didn\u2019t take much longer. Now we are relying on our legacy more than ever before and waiting years for contracts to expire to sign top talent. Instead of signing what is needed, when it\u2019s needed. You can\u2019t build a team like that.\n\nReal Madrid needs to pivot into becoming a team that wins by playing football collectively, a team that has a long term manager with a long term strategy - from the youth squad to the senior squad. The pay to win strategy just doesn\u2019t work for us anymore.\n\nMadrid needs a deep restructuring or we risk becoming the next Manchester United. \n\nWhat do you guys think? \n\nCan Madrid continue to win long-term with the same model (and president) that both gave us the galacticos disaster but later brought us 6 Champions Leagues?

Needs bit more polish \u2022 Camavinga: Top 6/8 hybrid, needs to start more, very useful and skilled player but risky as sole DM \u2022 Mastantuono: Good upside, better as a right drifting CAM, not RW, good rotation player now \u2022 Ceballos: Good backup, but needs to go to make space for a playmaker/orchestrator so leave\n\n  \nIssues: Needs to sign a world class Playmaker CM; Maybe Nico Paz is such a player but he's not ready yet if we need results from year 1\n\n\n\nDefenders:\n\n\u2022 Carreras: Good LB, good upside and continues to be a starter now (Remember how Carvajal and Marcelo was at 21?; he'll improve) \u2022 Fran: Good backup LB \u2022 Trent: Proven world class attacking RB/Quarterback, defending is a weakness though \u2022 Valverde: A bonus RB, a good defensive and solid RB (if he agrees to rotate with Trent) \u2022 Dean Huijsen: Very good ball playing tall LCB for his age and higher upside, still needs improvement against top sides \u2022 Militao: Top RCB, but Post ACL, struggling to maintain fitness and peak form. If this continues, better buy another RCB (Saliba?!) \u2022 Raul Asencio: Good backup RCB (Bit reckless and hot headed, costing points so that needs to be sorted) \u2022 Carvajal, Alaba, Rudiger, Mendy: Legends but needs to be phased out like Marcelo/Ramos etc to free space\n\nIssues: Needs to sign a ball playing LCB like Schlotterbeck who is plug and play from day 1 at highest level (BVB/GermanNT already); Huijsen alone risky. Also might need to sign another RCB if Militao situation continues. Maybe a backup RB will be needed after Carva leaves. If Carreras fails to perform even after 2 or more years, will need to sign another world class LB and Fran will have to leave.\n\n\n\nGoalkeepers: \u2022 Courtois: Best since last 5 years. Has few more years to go as world's best. No debate \u2022 Lunin: Very good backup or even can start long term after Courtois leaves (Proven in 23/24)\n\n Issues: None\n\nWhat do you think Folks? Any suggestions?",

        "content": "Football is a very short lived sport. Managers nowadays barely last more than two seasons, after two losses in a row it\u00b4s crisis, what happened the season before doesn\u00b4t really count, what could potentially happen in two years after also doesn\\`t.  Real Madrid is probably the pinnacle of that.\n\nOn the other side more and more big clubs are signing project players. Players who obviously have talent, but who are still raw and who still need a bit of time. So Real Madrid signed the likes of Vinicius, Rodrygo, Reinier, Endrick, Mastantuono, Camavinga, Hujisen. Man City signed the likes of Khusanov, Victor Reis, Doku, Savinho. Chelsea signed so many like talented 20 year olds, they are basically hoarding talent.\n\nNow this works as long as there is an experienced core of players around kind of leading them. So Real Madrid were fine when the likes of Kroos, Modric, a fit version of Carvajal, Benzema...were still around. It actually looked like they got the transition spot on. Man City were fine when they still had De Bruyne, Walker, the peak versions of Ruben Dias and Rodri leading the team. \n\nProblems start when the experienced core of players is starting to fail. In Real Madrid\u00b4s case the current experienced core of players age wise (apart from Courtois) is Carvajal, Alaba, R\u00fcdiger, Mendy, maybe Ceballos. 4 players who have had massive injury issues and one player who has never really been more than a squad player. After that you have the likes of Militao and Trent, who have also had big injury problems this season. The oldest outfield player who is actually playing is Valverde at 27. \n\n3 of Real Madrid\u00b4s back four currently are Carreras, Hujisen and Asencio. I\u00b4m happy all three of them are at the club, I think they could all have good careers at the club but they probably shouldn\u00b4t be starting together at this point in their career. \n\nCompare that to the Champions League winning sides of Real Madrid in the last 15 years. The youngest starting 11 in a final was the la decima starting eleven and the average age was 26.7 years and it would have been older if Xabi Alonso hadn\u00b4t been suspended and Pepe had been fit to start. \n\n",

I personally think endrick will do a better job than him on rw or even arda is more dangerous on rw.. he may has the pressing thing better than others and that\u2019s why arbeloa and even xabi likes to start him. But i think this transfer window we should have bought someone a bit better and a natural rw .. i maybe wrong in the future i hope im wrong and he will succeed and be our next Di maria.",

I saw no mention that it was even happening to I thought I would share the news with you all about the loss today.\n\nReal Madrid Femenino have not won a trophy yet. The 2020\u201321 season was their first season. This was the 22nd meeting of the women's Cl\u00e1sico and Real Madrid has only won once. The matches are very rarely close. Real Madrid has scored 10 goals and given up 77. So as a fan who watches the matches, they are pretty painful to watch to be honest.",
