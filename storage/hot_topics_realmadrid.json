He has only started to get his groove a couple weeks ago and the Mbappe that we have seen lately is not the WorldCup Mbappe just yet.\n\nAnd to think the season is only half way through.\n\nInsane. \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab",

Regular watchers of Castilla say he has been way better than Raul Asencio for Castilla.. Will he get some game time in the coming weeks so that we can give a much needed rest to poor Rudiger? I\u2019m worried about how much Rudiger has played. David Alaba will probably take some time before he\u2019s fully ready to play.. Jacobo Ramon and Lorenzo Agaudo along with Raul Asencio could cover right back and CB spots every now and then hopefully\u2026",

        "content": "\nIt\u2019s crazy how much this guy has improved. Mbappe was never bad, but the high expectations everyone had for him got to him. The start was rough, from missing penalties to not scoring easy goals, this man was made fun of countless times. People expected him to be perfect from day one. Questioned why he is being given so many chances when he doesn\u2019t play good. But he needed that to build his confidence. Mbappe deserves an apology. He has been the most consistent recently. He tries his best every single match and you can tell from his performance. Goal or no goal, he gives his 100% when on the field and the way he silenced everyone is satisfying. Mbappe has scored in all the last 5 matches. I hope he keeps doing what he is doing. \n",

        "content": "Hey everyone,  \n\nI\u2019m planning to attend the upcoming Real Madrid vs. Athletic Bilbao match, and I\u2019m trying to figure out the best way to secure my spot. I guess this game is popular?\n\nI\u2019m considering waiting to buy through the official Real Madrid website when tickets go on sale, since I am a Madridistas Premium member for early access. Has anyone done this before? Is it worth the wait?  \n\nAlternatively, I\u2019ve seen options on StubHub already. Should I just go for those now, or wait and try my luck with the official sale?  \n\nAny advice from experienced matchgoers or Madridistas would be greatly appreciated!  \n\nThanks in advance!",

        "content": "Hi Madristas,\n\nMe and my friends are planning a Europe trip in late May this year, and we really want to watch Real Madrid's UCL knockout match, preferably  semi's or even the final if possible. We have been fans since our childhood and it would mean a lot for us.\n\nWe know these are the most sough after match and getting the tickets would not be easy, but we still wanna give it a try. If any of you have any tips or suggestions on what we could do it increase our chances to get tickets to either of the matches, please share it with us here. Do we need to sign up for the club membership? Is there any chance to get tickets if not part of membership? Are the 3rd party website like viagogo reliable? Our itinerary will be depending on which match we get tickets for (i.e either in Madrid or Munich).\n\nWe know this trip will be costly and depends on our Schengen visa application too, we want to check all boxes to make this trip memorable.",
