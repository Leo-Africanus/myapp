This is the first time I see the club doing something like this. The board must be furious after these decisions, it's not the first time the VAR is pretending to be asleep.. not only they turn blind eyes on these fouls, but the 2 times Mbapp\u00e9 was on side, yet the VAR checked only the frame AFTER the ball was passed and Mbapp\u00e9 is offside.. and this right here could have easily ended Mbapp\u00e9's career. the tackle was horrible ! \n\nWhat are your thoughts on the club posting this ?

        "content": "In the past 5 seasons Real Madrid hasn't purchased or signed new players as much as they used to in the last 2 decades, recently it was mostly loan returns or buy-back options or signing free players.\n\nfor example during 2010-2011 Winter market we brought Adebayor on loan despite having both Benzema and Higuain who were physically fine. and on 2008-2009 season Van nistelrooy, de la red, and Diarra missed out the remainder of the season due to injuries and the management brought replacements (Huntelaar, Lassana, Parejo, and Faubert) even though they weren't useful.\n\nbut now we don't have Carvajal and Militao for the remainder of this season and our management don't want to sign any new players even temporarily as loans.\n\nReal Madrid is entitled to have 25 players registered in the first team, but we have 22 now with shirt numbers 12,24,and 25 available. or maybe i should say 21 as Vallejo is a bench warmer and never used not even in easier copa games.\n\nso what are the reasons? is it money? is it greed of players and their agents? is it Ancelotti? is it Perez?",

        "title": "What are the signings you want next season??",
        "content": "This season so far has been mixed bags and while we have individually top players, we also lack balance in the team. \n\nFor example there's no cohesion in midfield and we lack a playmaker who can connect the team, play in pocket spaces and break lines with through balls.\n\nWe have average at best fullbacks and have an ageing defence as well as Militao who might not get back to previous level with back to back ACLs.\n\nThese are the signings I would go for if it was up to me.\n\n1. Wirtz - Xabi might become our next coach and who's the better option to be playmaker than his best player. Wirtz is arguably the best playmaker in the game right now and can bring much needed creativity to our midfield.\n\n2. TAA - Wish Hakimi was playing anywhere but PSG or James wasn't made of glasses. Trent is extraordinary with ball and although he isn't good defensively, he can give different dimension to our attack and spark some thing in often dead right sided attack.\n\n3. Huijsen - Everytime I watch him, he keeps impressing. Tall, young and ball playing defender who's Spanish on top of it. He can be the future of our defence.\n\n4. Miguel - With Davies most likely renewal at Bayern, our options are slim and need to spend more money elsewhere. Miguel can be cost effective yet a very good option.\n\nOnes to keep an eye on.\n1. Murillo - Has been a beast for Nottingham and with recent renewal, move is unlikely. He has potential to play for Madrid in coming years.\n\n2. Nico Paz - One of our own and has been very good for Como. Another season in serie A can do him well at this time though.\n\n3. Angelo Stiller - There's lack of quality deep lying playmakers among the youngsters right now. Stiller is one to look for among the few options out there and I won't be surprised if any big team moves for him soon.",

        "content": "We are talking about one of the weakest teams in La Liga. Surely Asensio who IMO has not had a single bad performance and has been constantly praised game after the other could have started. He even played well AFTER Rudi got injured...\n\nGiven the chaotic schedule ahead of us, Carlo should have rotated even more players and players like Arda and Endrick should have started.\n\nwe have seen Barca field literally teenagers and has managed to turned 4-5 of them to world class players. We even have Ramon to play as CB\n\nForcing to field his \"best\" XI against a relegation team is a MANAGER issue imo.",

Superb technique but still needs to improve his physicality. He\u2019s a big lad though now compared to when he took that pic with Marcelo- 6\u20190. Very elegant and graceful on the ball though, just like Jude.",

But the I see the \u201dnon season ticket holder member\u201d - what is that? Is it possible to become that? \nI know that \u201dsocio\u201d is nearly impossible, is that the same thing? \n\nAlso another thing - how come I was available to search for tickets 2 days ago (Saturday) for the Atletico game? It says Madridsta premium member should have gotten access today?\nChecked like an hour ago and everything var sold out :(",

        "content": "I saw a lot of comments, some rightly deserved  about Vini not playing, well, how the team plays better without Vini and how Vini should have came off and I just want to say how wrong all those comments are.\n\nIt seems everyone forgot that Vini was the only player that actually had the ball in the back of the net yesterday but no one talks about Mbappe taking the bait and swinging at the defender (even though he was getting pulled), which made Vinis goal to be ruled out.\n\nAlso Mbappe lost the ball just as much as Vini and had so many bad touches. Was in a good position to pass and decided to shoot from a tight angle.\n\nHow come Vini gets all the hate when they were other players including Rodrygo who didn't really perform.\n\nMbappe should have came off at around 70 minutes and so should Bellingham for Arda and Endrick and Brahim came on for Rodrygo.\n\nAncelotti waited till it was too late and lost our momentum when we had them on the back foot but some people here will still be abusing and attacking other fans for having opinions when we can all see the same shit week in week out.\n\nAnd no Rudiger might have a hamstring because the manager barely fucking rotates and makes subs way too late every effing match. He will get praise for making Asencio \"better\" when in reality he's only force to play him because of injury. ",
