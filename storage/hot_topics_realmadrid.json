It\u2019s not like he demands to play every minute, I honestly believe he is even willing to play for free for this club.

We need Luka in this dressing room, he is irreplaceable. The guy literally just played 90 minutes away to Sevilla and was one of our best players.

        "title": "Having Three Left Wingers Isn\u2019t What\u2019s Holding Us Back.",
        "content": "\nPeople keep saying Real Madrid can\u2019t play with three left-wingers up front. That having Vin\u00edcius, Rodrygo and Mbapp\u00e9 together won\u2019t work because they\u2019re all left-sided players or because they\u2019re not tall. But that argument doesn\u2019t hold up.\n\nTake PSG for example. They\u2019re in the Champions League final, playing with Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Kvaratskhelia and either Barcola or Dou\u00e9. All three are naturally left-sided wingers. None of them are traditional number nines. None are tall target men. But tactically, Luis Enrique has built a system that makes it work.\n\nWhat makes PSG work is not individual height or footedness, but structure. Off the ball, they press in a 4-4-2 or 4-3-3 shape with clear roles. On the ball, they rely on fluid rotation, positional discipline and overloads on the flanks. The wingers stretch wide, the midfield supports, and the full-backs alternate their depth depending on who\u2019s holding width. It\u2019s all synchronized.\n\nMbapp\u00e9 has over 40 goals this season playing mostly through the center. Kvaratskhelia cuts in with freedom. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 switches flanks or drifts inside depending on game flow. It\u2019s not about profiles, it\u2019s about usage.\n\nSo when people say Real Madrid can\u2019t make it work with three similar profiles, it\u2019s lazy analysis. Vin\u00edcius has won two Champions Leagues on the left. Rodrygo has delivered big performances from the right. Mbapp\u00e9 has proven he can lead the line. The issue isn\u2019t the trio. It\u2019s the lack of tactical identity.\n\nStop blaming individual players for a collective problem. Structure creates balance. The tools are there. What\u2019s missing is the system.",

        "content": "I had a hunch about this a while back but the Nico and Rodri talk in the past week, frivolous as it might be, I think confirms it. Flo seems to be going after Spanish players who stand a good chance to star in the NT in 2026.  \n  \nThink about it, the Spanish NT is entering another renaissance and with the youth on the squad they are likely to be very competitive for the next decade. Nacho and LV are gone, Carvajal's replacement was transferred in this year and that's going to affect his playing time at the World Cup. Fran and Ceballos rarely even make the roster and they're not trending up, Asencio will likely make the squad but isn't at the level to star yet.\n\nHujisen and Carreras would definitely make the squad and could star if their profile keeps rising, but those are obvious choices just from a youth, need, and not taking up an EU spot perspective. But just having Real Madrid defenders isn't enough to stop the press from only covering Yamal as the next coming of Messi. Nico isn't a fit at all but he's by far the best Spanish NT attacking talent that Barca isn't employing and he's cheap and the right age.\n\nGrimaldo and Rodri are too old for our usual transfer strategy but they fit a huge need and are very likely to start the 2026 WC. I don't really think those transfers are likely but the only reason they make long term sense is if you think Yamal tearing up the 2026 WC with little Real Madrid representation is bad for the long term popularity of the club globally.\n\nDenying Kyle Walker this winter when we had three long term starters with ACL injuries also kind of only makes sense through this lens. Same with having no interest in Theo or Nico Paz so far.   \n  \nI think it's possible the board has been hoarding money to do something like this for a minute.\n\n  \nConfirmed new transfers:\n\n\\- Dean Hujisen\\*  \n\\- TAA\n\nRumored transfers or stated interest:\n\n\\- Nico Williams\\*  \n\\- Alvaro Carreras\\*  \n\\- Alejandro Grimaldo\\*  \n\\- Rodri\\*\n\nPlayers we've been offered or could get for cheap that we have denied in the past 6 months:\n\n\\- Theo Hernandez  \n\\- Nico Paz  \n\\- Kyle Walker\n\n\\*Spanish national or existing Spanish NT player",

        "content": "As genuinely life-changing that Xabi's arrival (alongside the new signings) will be, don't expect any magnificent change out the gate. Just look at how poor we've been all season. A lot of that can definitely be attributed to Ancelotti tactics (or lack thereof) and some gaps in the squad, but it's not like as soon as a new manager and players come, everything's fixed. These sort of things don't just change overnight.\n\nThe Club World Cup starts in mid-June. Xabi simply won't have the time to implement his tactics and philosophy. The new signings won't have enough time to synchronize with the current squad (all during CWC tournament nonetheless). I fear the fanbase will turn on our new members if they don't immediately deliver results or show promise. We all saw how they treated Mbapp\u00e9. Just imagine how Trent will be getting ripped on social media for a mistake. From Liverpool and Madrid fans alike. It's in times like those where it's most crucial that we back the players, especially during a period of transition.\n\nIn all, don\u2019t expect too much. Don\u2019t expect instant chemistry, instant structure, or trophies right out the gate. Just back the team. Back the project. Xabi and the players will need time. If you're ready to write people off in July, please take your 'support' somewhere else.",

        "content": "I think it's between Wirtz or Enzo.\n\nI don't know about the credibility of the sources, but I do find it as something Perez could do. Personally,  I am not thrilled with this, as I do not feel the need to have another superstar among the likes of Kylian, Jude, Vini, Rodrygo, and Trent. I would rather prefer a low profile signing (cost and fame wise) like Stiller, and then build using the talent we already have. \n\nI also feel that the arrival of another superstar would reduce the opportunities Arda would get, as I seriously believe in his talent as a player and to his commitment for Real Madrid.\n\nBetween Wirtz and Enzo, I think it would be Wirtz due to Xabi's preference. Plus I do not want Enzo Fernandez because of him being a racist mf. What do you guys think of Wirtz in the Real Madrid setup. Keeping aside the money, will he do wonders in the midfield with Jude and Valverde?",

But I couldn\u2019t find much content from our side \u2014 how we as Real Madrid fans reacted when he joined.\n\nI know Figo later proved himself and became a key part of the Gal\u00e1cticos, earning the love and respect of our fanbase. But I\u2019m curious \u2014 was he warmly welcomed from day one, or were there doubts and hate like what we saw with Mbapp\u00e9 recently (even though Mbapp\u00e9 didn\u2019t do anything close to what Figo did to Bar\u00e7a)?\n\nTo be honest, if someone like Rodri ever joined Madrid, I\u2019d struggle to accept it considering how he treated Vini. So I really wonder how Figo managed to win people over, and what the initial reaction was like when he first arrived.\n\nWould love to hear from older fans who remember that time or anyone who has insights!\n",
