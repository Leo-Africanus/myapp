        "content": "#FT: BETIS DEP. 1:3 CASTILLA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#1\u00aa FEDERACI\u00d3N\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:** \n\n[0:1 V\u00edctor Mu\u00f1oz 6'](https://www.reddit.com/r/realmadrid/s/yqPjBo72yV) \n\n[0:2 Gonzalo Garc\u00eda 21'](https://www.reddit.com/r/realmadrid/s/sTudWSuniT) \n\n[0:3 V\u00edctor Mu\u00f1oz 53'](https://www.reddit.com/r/realmadrid/s/sd6ixPLL57) \n\nRed card: Nobel Mendy (Betis Dep.) 56' \n\n1:3 Marcos Fern\u00e1ndez (p) 76'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - kickoff, vamos! \n\n\u26bd 6' - GOLLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - Jacobo Ram\u00f3n plays the ball forward from deep, where Pol Fortuny drags the center backs' attention towards himself and flicks the ball on, which allows V\u00edctor to run into the space created, pick up the ball and finish past the keeper! \n\n13' - big chance for Gonzalo just inside the box to increase the lead, but he loses balance while shooting and it goes wide\n\n14' - what a miss by Gonzalo! He is put through with a great long ball by Jacobo which the defender lets slip past, Gonzalo picks up the ball, rounds the keeper, but then puts the ball into the side netting - good performance from the team so far, but the 2:0 should've fallen here already.\n\n15' - the play was ruled offside late on, which would've been a grave mistake by the referee \n\n19' - next big chance, this time V\u00edctor gets his shot saved 1v1 against the keeper! \n\n\u26bd 21' - GOLLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - after a corner, the ball gets played out wide to Yusi, who whips in the cross - it gets intercepted by the Betis defender, but falls right in front of Gonzalo's feet, and he has no trouble putting it past the keeper for the well deserved 2:0-lead! He extends his lead as the best goalscorer of the league, now with 15 goals\n\nHT - after the best 30 minutes of the season so far and attaining a deserved 2-0 lead, the team slowed down a bit at the end of the first half, still being at least as dangerous as Betis through counter attacks though. The face of the team looks changed with Manuel \u00c1ngel and Jacobo Ram\u00f3n back from injury, especially the latter is having a great match\n\n46' - 2nd half underway \n\n\u26bd 53' - GOLLLL DEL CASTILLA - counter attack for Castilla, Pol Fortuny puts through Victor Mu\u00f1oz again, he dribbles past the last defender with amazing acceleration, then slots it past the keepers legs for what is hopefully the decider in this match - Victor with his 5th goal in 4 matches, he is in amazing form \n\n\ud83d\udfe5 56' - straight red card for Betis' Mendy - absolutely disgraceful what he's doing - V\u00edctor is on the ground after a rough tackle, and with the game stopped and the referee busy with handing out a yellow card to another player, Mendy stamps on his ankle fully on purpose, putting his entire body's weight on top of it - then he has the nerve to complain and act surprised when the referee shows him the red card. Nice job by the linesman, who noticed the stamp \n\n63' - Victor is completely free in front of the keeper after a low cross by David Jim\u00e9nez, but this time he can't put it past the keeper \n\n\ud83d\udd04 65' - Valde for Yusi and Antonio David for Manuel \u00c1ngel \n\n\ud83d\udd04 72' - more subs, Edgar for Rivas, and Borja Alonso is back after a long injury, he comes on for Pol Fortuny \n\n76' - penalty for Betis Deportivo, absolutely shocking decision by the referee, Jacobo clearly got the ball with his tackling, then two Betis players basically take each other out \n\n\u26bd 76' - Marcos Fern\u00e1ndez converts \n\nFT - a well deserved win for Castilla against 3rd placed Betis Deportivo - the team was much superior and had chances for more than 3 goals, while the only goal Betis managed to score was a penalty invented by the referee. The team slowed down after the red card for Betis and the substitutions, with the result not being in any real danger from that point on. The team is now 10th for the moment, 3 points above the relegation zone but also just 2 below the playoff spots \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 20:30 CET\n\n**Venue:** Ciudad Deportiva Luis del Sol, Sevilla \n\n**Referee**: Guillermo Conejero S\u00e1nchez \n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 2, Matchday 20\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[FEF TV](https://feftv.com) (subscription - 12.99\u20ac/month)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (5-2-3): Diego Pi\u00f1eiro - Youssef Enr\u00edquez \u2018Yusi\u2019 (65' Victor Valdepe\u00f1as 'Valde'), Mario Rivas (72' Edgar Pujol), Jacobo Ram\u00f3n, Quique Ribes, David Jim\u00e9nez - Jos\u00e9 Maria Andr\u00e9s \u2018Chema\u2019, Manuel \u00c1ngel (65' Antonio David) - V\u00edctor Mu\u00f1oz, Gonzalo Garc\u00eda, Pol Fortuny (72' Borja Alonso) \n\nBench: Mario de Luis (GK), Hugo de Llanos, Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez, Baba Diocou. \n\nUnavailable: Fran Gonz\u00e1lez (first team call-up), Ra\u00fal Asencio (first team call-up), David Cuenca (pubalgia), David Ruiz (?), Loren Aguado (first team call-up), Andr\u00e9s Campos (?), C\u00e9sar Palacios (ACL tear), Jeremy de Le\u00f3n (ankle injury), Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga (muscle injury). \n\nCoach: Ra\u00fal\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** WLWLW\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 15th | 22pt | 5-7-7 | 29:22\n",

He has been key for us, as far back as the 2019/20 LL run-in where he was excellent. He has been a vital defender in 2 UCL wins. He has locked down world class wingers in big UCL nights, he saved us with inches to spare vs Man City.\n\nPeople who have a flashy toy/\u201cmodern fullback\u201d obsession always wanted Mendy out, even when he was solid for us. Other teams have more modern fullbacks, but we (and Mendy, by extension) have the titles. I\u2019ve seen someone ask for Marc Cucurella for God\u2019s sake!\n\nI hope this is Mendy\u2019s last season and I think it will be but it should\u2019t be used to rewrite his entire 6 years at the club.

But for some reason, I keep seeing people shit on Vini online, and everyone in the comments is agreeing with them for some reason. \n\nIt gets to a point where I think it's just out of racism and not disliking a player because you just don't like them. I don't like I don't like Phil Foden because I find him kind of annoying, but you don't see me going on hate tangents for it or quoting him just to mock him for what he said. \n\nI also guarantee most people saying this are under 18 because adults who talk like this are the same to watch a cunt like Asmondgold. It's similar to hate players like Rashford or Saka get just for being black. But there are things you could give Vini criticism for it's just that they don't. It's like they get off making fun of or mocking ",

He\u2019s Spanish, solid in defence, a good prospect, good with the feet AND young. \n\nImagine that. Asensio. Martinez. Huijsen. \n\nBut I think we all know we only go for players that are free. Also the fact that it seems like that Perez does not care anymore for the sporting side and only dreams about his super league. ",

        "content": "So I'm reading in posts and comments : \"One bad game and those \\*\\*\\*\\* turned on Tchouameni\" and \"F Bernabeu for whistling Tchouameni, he shut them up and you can't blame him for playing a position that isn't his\"\n\nDid any of these watch the actual games ? This season, I remember Bellingham and Rudiger having 2 or 3 bad games.. Tchouameni ? The opposite. And a funny fact, yesterday was his best and maybe only good performance as a CDM !\n\nThe few couple of games he had and was good he was actually a CB ! This is the same shit as Mbapp\u00e9 in his bad games, getting a pass with his horrible performance, horrible touch, weak shooting, zero spatial awareness, just because he is not a number 9.\n\nIt's a fact that Tchouameni has been below average overall this season and on top of my mind, yesterday's game and Girona were his only 'Great' performances. Feel free to share ratings, as maybe I'm the one missing something and he has actually been consistent as a CDM but only sucked as CB..\n\nI remember seeing his stiffness in Bilbao and questioning why the hell has he started this game. In many other games, he is just kind of there... Bernabeu clearly had enough.. it's the most demanding fans and even CR7 got whistled, Benzema got whistled. I don't trash or shit on a player for playing 3 or 4 bad games... but Tchouameni's form and performance has been very questionable and what makes it worse is that he is starting ahead of a player who is showing promise and loved by the fans, Asencio.\n\nTchouameni was MOTM yesterday together with Endrick, good for him and for the team. What we want is consistency.\n\nBut Tchouameni was no prime Casemiro or Xabi Alonso until the Clasico.. he was, together with Vazquez, our main holes in defense and except for yesterday, he has been our worst player in the midfield that even Ceballos who many fans ( including me last season ) wanted him sold/replaced, is playing well and better than him.\n\nEDIT: this kind of thinking is the same one that got Vazquez to start against Bar\u00e7a.. it's because he did well against Pachuca and some other La Liga average teams.. so yes coaches decided he is CAFU and he is now a good RB.",
