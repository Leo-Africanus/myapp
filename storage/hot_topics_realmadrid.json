Very unfortunate considering that he is finally NEARLY back to his old self and could have potentially scored more goals, yet no one was there to back him up! This was supposed to be a huge game. How in the hell did we not have a proper plan?? \n\nMidfield and especially our NON-EXISTENT defense line in shambles! Embarrassing.\n\nAncelotti is very stubborn keeping his favourite boys in Starting XI and refusing to sub when we have a very talented stacked bench players waiting the whole game. He should be shown the door and take Lucas, Tchou and Mendy out with him. Useless coach.\n\n\n\n",

He has had 20 ucl knockout goals in 30 games (6th highest overall and the most at his age) and 8 wc knockout goals in 8 games (Highest wc knockout goals tied with the legendary r9) with 4 coming in the finals. \n\nIt was around this age, when ronaldo started to explode in champions league scoring goals for fun and lots of them in the knockout stages. Can mbappe do the same for us? I mean he has scored 3 goals in 3 finals for us already. He has had his lows for us but to be fair it was a new league and team for his and he clearly needed time adjusting.",

This totals to almost entire half time to score 3 goals against the team that has 1 player less. \n\nWe used to do come back against the prime City and PSG in much less minutes with equal number of players. \n\nTonight, players were lost and desperately needed some tactical plan. Funnily enough, Ancelotti is almost proudly stating that he is making no any plans. \n\nIn addition, players were showing passion no matter what. Tonight, nobody cared apart from few. And that is happening when players have guaranteed spot no matter what. Regardless how they play, they will play the next game, too. \n\nI would understand forcing some yougsters to unlock their potential and make the future for them and club. But Ancelotti is trying hard with Vasquez and Mendy like they are 17. For different reasons, he plays Tchouameni cause they payed him 80millions. He must play even as a goalkeeper, he must play. \n\nLastly, Carlo is not 40, he know he has no future as a coach at Real Madrid anymore. He should just leave and make fans happy. This is ridiculous what he is doing. He should have left last season. He knew we were not playing well since he came, and that we won what we won on individual brilliance and luck\n",

        "content": "This isn't the solution. Playing Valverde as a right back might seem like a quick fix since he's miles ahead of Lucas V\u00e1zquez in that role, but we need to stop forcing players to play out of position instead of addressing the need through proper signings.  \n\nWhy settle for being a decent right back when you can be a world class midfielder? Players may be willing to sacrifice for the team, but they're not happy playing out of position, and it affects their mental state.\nMore importantly, it stunts their growth and momentum when they're stuck in an unfamiliar role for too long.  \n\nI'm not here to defend Tchouam\u00e9ni, he has been underperforming game after game, but I believe he was on the right track before Carlo started using him as a center back. Now that he's played more games as a CB than in his natural position, not only is he ineffective defensively, but he also seems to have lost his edge in midfield.  \n\nFor young players, especially those who have only been at Madrid for a few seasons, it's crucial to develop in their natural positions. These players need time to find their rhythm, build confidence, and fully evolve into their roles. Playing them out of position disrupts that process and risks wasting their potential.  \n\nAnother big issue is that by constantly forcing players to play out of position, we enable P\u00e9rez to continue avoiding the squad's actual needs. This approach only gives him confidence to stick with patchwork solutions instead of making the signings we desperately need. It reminds me of how our two recent UCL wins gave him the excuse to overlook the cracks in the squad, leaving alot of issues unaddressed.  \n\nIf we want long-term success, we need proper squad planning and players who are allowed to thrive in their natural roles before desperately playing them out of position without much choice on their part.

        "content": "I cant tell if this is tactics, or if this is just how real madrid play, but the way real madrid simply cannot exert any pressure on the game because the cbs arent used to put pressure high up the pitch is insane, im not asking to play barcelonas high line which causes problems for them against every single team apart from us apparently, but we're at the complete opposite end of the stick, the line completely collapses towards goal under any pressure at all. \n\nNot just against barcelona, but against every team real madrid play against. It's the reason real madrid look so easy to play against, they cannot put pressure on with their defenders. Our attackers also dont put pressure on. Vini and mbappe will lightly jog which im not knocking at all because they have their own job to do which isn't to press so fair, but the back line needs to be involved in the game, footballs evolved way past just attacking and defending which is if you look at it ancelottis philosophy to playing the game. The team attacks and then they drop back into defensive formation. That's simply not gonna work anymore ",

        "content": "We're over halfway through the season, and it's the same old story. Carlo Ancelotti, with all his experience and accolades, still hasn't managed to get this team to click. It's beyond frustrating to watch.\n\nFirst and foremost, our defense is in a state of absolute shit. Yet Carlo continues to start Vazquez and Tchouameni while benching one of our best defenders in Asencio.\n\nFor the 2nd time in a row, we hardly threatened Flick\u2019s high line. Carlo refuses to build out from the back, resorting to aimless passes that get us nowhere. There\u2019s no creativity, no effective strategy, just a lot of wasted potential.\n\nWe've seen flashes of what this team can do, but just when we think things are starting to click, we get a reality check like this. How can we have such a talented squad and still be struggling like this?",

        "content": "Everyone of us is fucking mad. Losing a Clasico happens, but what, now we are back to conceding 4 and 5 goals in a single game against Barcelona in just 4 months ? What's next until we know we need re-structuring in defense ? Maybe conceding 8 goals in the away game in La Liga will help ? \n\nThe tough tests this season were BVB, Barcelona, Liverpool and Milan.. we won only against BVB, and credits goes to the team but Nuri Sahin poor management and parking the bus early helped a lot. The rest of the teams had good wingers, and they all cooked our fullbacks, Mendy, a once every 2 seasons, top defensive player, and... Lucas Vazquez..\n\nAgain he starts. I get that the goals weren't FULLY on him, as Tchou is no Maldini and today, even Rudiger was out of place, and neither Cama or Valverde covered that CDM spot... but he keeps proving every game against good wingers that he can't defend for his life unless Rodrygo or Valverde helps him... that space in between him and Tchouameni became a popular tourist destination for opposite team forwards... \n\nHe is a fucking backup and him doing good against Pachuca and Getafe and Las Palmas doesn't mean he will do good against wingers like Raphinha... are the Castilla players that bad ? I don't know who is the starting RB there, but if Asencio got promoted, maybe I am missing something and the Castilla RB is not a good fit either ? If not.. are we fucking broke or something ? Can't we loan a RB at least ? a physical RB ? \n\nI defended Tchouameni and Ancelotti's decision.. but he is no Maldini that justifies benching Asencio, who in every minute he plays, he proves he is very elegant and can handle his own, in areal duals and tackling and he is even pretty fast... even his passing and build up is good.. I don't know what Tchouameni did this season to deserve to get ahead. I remember the 'best' game he had against Girona, that's it. \n\nAlso why the fuck Ceballos was benched today ? We have been shit in the midfield despite having all those big names stacked next to each other and HE was the one who fixed the build up, linking our defense and midfield and forwards. He does the easy and chill job of passes forward, with the least dribbling and ball holding. He is no Kroos but he is the closest to filling his place... we improved a lot since he started, but today, for some reason, Ancelotti decided long balls is the answer and he shouldn't start... very questionable.\n\nNow to our starters... something is off even with the player with the monstrous mentality today, Bellingham. He looked like he didn't care at all. He is usually a leader on the pitch, but today, he wasn't good. He was consistent and carried us countless times together with Rudiger. It still hurts that the one bad game they have is in a title final and against Bar\u00e7a... \n\nVinicius needs to fucking focus. Did it get to his head that he is the 'best' player and everything is a conspiracy against him after CR7 told him you're the best ? He let his team down to 10 men after being provoked by Valencia players, almost costing us 3 important points, then the Mallorca game, he gets involved in the fight even though he is in the bench, and today, he was nowhere to be seen.\n\nModric pulled us through in the Valencia game, but today he was very clumsy. worst sub.\n\nWorst game for Bellingham and Rudiger since they were signed too.\n\nPerez, please. Like I said in another post a couple of months ago, he decided that Ancelotti will always find the answer with the 'available' players just because he made it work when Benzema left and use Jude as false 9. Buy us a fucking RB. the La Liga teams that succeeded in beating and drawing against Barcelona also had to deal with Raphinha.. We are making Barcelona look like prime Brazil ! Every fucking time ! We conceded 9 goals in two games ! FUCK OFF Perez and buy some fucking right back ! I won't even be mad if he under performs, at least he is a right back ! ",
