        "title": "Yet Another Club Legend Disrespected... What Else is New? It Must Not Be Ignored That Xabi Has Been Disrespected From His First Day As Manager",
        "content": "Xabi performed a miracle at Bayer Leverkusen. Even if Bundesliga is a 'easy' league, just look at where Leverkusen were before him, where they are now, and how much they dominated Bayern Munich while he was here.\n\nReal Madrid asked him to manage the club because of that miracle... But then they fucking disallowed him to do anything which he did at Leverkusen. He had to abandon his 343 high-press possession style. He had to abandon any hopes of getting anything but token effort from his forwards. Wirtz pressed like a madman. He lost the luxury of subbing off these lazy forwards even when he intended to close off the match. \n\nHe never said anything wrong in public. He handled the Vini tantrum with maximum grace. Lesser managers have completely relegated better players to the u21 team for lesser offense. He stood 100% behind his players and hell, his employer, when Flo made extremely aggressive comments on Negreia and Barca.\n\nHe had Xhaka to orchestrate everything at Leverkusen. Real didn't have anyone to make play from the deep. How many years it has been since Kroos has been unreplaced? Is there any serious club which has ever won anything without a creative central midfielder with a great passing range? Xabi had to ask Arda or Jude to play that role, and Arda didn't have the required defensive game and Jude the required passing game. If Trent was the Kroos replacement than Alonso barely got to field him in the eleven.\n\nHis team's performance on the pitch was acceptable as a new manager, despite everything.\n\nFinally, the only thing he demanded yesterday from the club after losing to a better football side on the day was a bit of class. Ignoring everything else, they were the better team on the pitch yesterday and there was no harm in performing the guard of honour for them, especially as the manager clearly asked the set of players to. Publicly opposing your manager on such a small issue is no good. Maybe Mbappe lead the team on that, but no one went against Mbappe. Just goes to show what is happening in that dressing room. \n\nWhat was Xabi to do after that? He is a club legend, and a very young manager. His stock hasn't plummeted at Real Madrid and he still has heavy demand elsewhere.\n\nWhat makes you think Arbeloa will be treated any better? He is the same age profile and probably worse when it comes to top level experience. He is no Zidane in terms of gravitas as far as his playing career goes. If Xabi's playing career earned him no respect as the manager, Arbeloa might earn even less respect. \n\nAre the only managers who survive in this club yes men and extremely lenient motivators? Had Real Madrid not managed to attract Courtois despite the 2 years he spent at Atleti (which was only possible because Courtois himself isn't a good person, just ask KDB) and had a different keeper, will they actually have been nearly as successful in all competitions? The amount of insane saves he makes is elite, and more importantly, the amount of mistakes he makes is in a different realm even when compared to someone like Donnarumma or Alisson. How much has the sheer quality of players like Courtois, prime Rudiger, Modric, Kroos, Ronaldo and Benzema carried the club over the years? That team would have won a lot despite the manager.\n\nXabi didn't have any player with the attitude of Modric but he had at least 8 players with an unsolicited ego. Most of them had no respect for him. Maybe because he was a disciplinarian when he came here and these players don't believe that they need discipline? Because he has always been classy and these players are allergic to class? \n\nJust how does Arbeloa deal with all this now?",

        "content": "Can't wait till Rudiger and Alaba finally leave, so we get 36 million euros salary freed up. And we can bring in some quality depth to the defense and never see Tchouameni playing down there ever again. Xabi deserved to get to that second season and fulfill his vision, but the injury situation has been horrible and the players haven't helped either.\n\nThe dream now would be to see a short term deal with Zidane coming in and just doing his magic. It would be good for him to familiarize hands on with the french players and also get back to coaching after half a decade away. And if he wants to coach the french team once Deschamps leaves, he should have a gentleman agreement to allow that. And Zidane is only 53 with the opportunity to sign some top defenders next season, so maybe he decides to stay. He's been in the scene quite a bit recently attending the NFL game at the Bernab\u00e9u and greeting Florentino P\u00e9rez, so idk. The only manager better than Alonso is Zizou, so why sack if you have none better, unless Zizou is a possibility.\n\nAnd Arbeloa should keep coaching the Castilla side and is wasted being the Madrid coach because he doesn't have the reputation which has a big influence in terms of managing players. And Castilla is looking good with him there which is what we want with our youth products and promotion isn't a far reach compared to previous seasons. Hopefully the situation is resolved quick.",

        "title": "What the last 16 Years of Real Madrid Managers has taught me",
        "content": "Not sure how anyone here who has been a fan of Real Madrid are surprised by what is going on. Lets go on a brief review of Real's recent managerial history.\n\n1. Jose Mourinho played his 4-2-3-1 for years, falling short of the goal post. After 3 years, 1 La Liga, 1 Copa, and 3 UCL Semi exits. He was replaced.\n2. Carlo replaced Mourinho and shifted to a 4-3-3 and found success immediately winning a UCL. His second season was trophyless and he left the club.\n3. Rafa Benitez followed Carlo and tried to implement the 4-2-3-1 again. His stint was 7 Months.\n4. Zidane followed Benitez. Put the team back in a 4-3-3 and we all know how that went(3 UCLs).\n5. Lopetegui arrived after the depature of CR7. He actually kept playing the 4-3-3, but ultimately clashed because he had his own ideas that didn't match the clubs. He lasted 4 Months.\n6. Santiago Solari was a caretaker manager after Lopetegui's dismissal. Won't criticize much here but he played a handful of different formations and tactics in a season that ended in an embarrassing UCL exit to Ajax.\n7. Zidane returns, business as usual in the 4-3-3. Although this stint ended after 2 years and 2 titles due to a trophyless 2nd season.\n8. Carlo returns again for a 2nd trophy filled stint. He played the 4-3-3 as always.\n9. Enter Xabi Alonso. Whose plan is to bring his style from Leverkusen and implement it at Real\n\nWhat did I learn from these managers over these years?\n\n1. No matter who you are, Real Madrid will part ways with a manager who is not doing well. Carlo Ancelotti came to Real, won immediately in his first season. Had a poor 2nd season and was OUT. Zidane in his second stint was allowed to finish the season (he won 3 UCLs in a row in his first tenure). Before he and the club \"mutually\" parted ways. But parted ways nonetheless. Mourinho was given 3 years, in which he won 3 trophies, with 3 UCL semifinal exits.\n2. Real Madrid are not looking for a coach. When you look at the history I listed above. The managers who did the least tactically, had the most success. This is important to me because it seems like Xabi came to Madrid to teach the players how to play his style of football. This created clashes. This squad is highly decorated, and Xabi is trying to teach them how to play a new brand of football when they already have/had a winning formula. At least in their minds.\n\nTl;DR Xabi Alonso's tactics will work at a smaller club where he has full control. Or it can work at a big club if he is given years to implement his style like Jurgen Klopp had at Liverpool. Xabi Alonso's style is not the right fit for Madrid's win immediately mentality. And this should be no surprise to anyone.",
