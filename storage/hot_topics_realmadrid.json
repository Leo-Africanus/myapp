Why is Barca 10x better this season than last? It's not because they made 10 new signings, it's not because Pedri and Cubarsi improved 10x over the summer. It's because Hansi Flick is 10x the tactical manager that Xavi is. There were so many times last season when the likes of Pedri, Raphinha, etc. got the ball and had no idea what to do with it. This season, the entire Barca team is clicking like a well-oiled machine, with everyone knowing exactly what their role is. \n\nThrowing these young players out there, especially against a top team like Arsenal, without clear tactical instruction is akin to the WW1 British generals telling their young soldiers to charge straight into machine gun fire ",

        "content": "We would have never discovered Asencio ? But we need Sergio\u2019s never give up mentality.. If we didn\u2019t re-sign CR7 why would we re-sign Ramos ? Losing Caravajal to injury .. losing Nacho and Kroos was to much to overcome. Were we blinded by the Mbappe signing? One attacker and we ignored every other hole in our squad. This team lacks accountability and unfortunately Carlo doesn\u2019t deliver what a Ramos/Caravajal would. Yes we have Modric but we all know Luka has never been that type of a leader. The speech before this second against Arsenal that Ramos would give would be incredible\u2026 or would we even be in this situation in the first place had we have signed him?",

        "content": "It seems that every time we play both Vini and Mbappe we do horribly. They both attack through the same areas and have little chemistry with each other. I recall one of the best games we had was with the narrow diamond formation. No wingers and 4 midfields and Mbappe and Rodrygo up top. Ceballos was amazing that match (which I can\u2019t recall which one) and controlled the midfield great. While Bellingham was playing as a shadow striker and trying to get strikers off rebounds or open passes. To me it seems that a lack of a good midfield is what messes up our team. We should give up some attack to focus on control and defense. We could even try to play long ball and try to get the ball over the defense since we have really fast players. What do you think the best tactics/ formations would be for the team? ",

        "content": "When he is playing you can't think of him as AM or RW but he is more playing as RWB. Sometimes you can see him in DM. He should play more in forward position and should create more chances which Madrid needs the most in current time. Because at the current time we have players that all playing individually except Bellingham in forward. Or he is thinking that I will be a good replacement of Toni. ",
