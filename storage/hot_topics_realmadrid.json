And for the third time, it's a stupid loss of possession, this time by Pitarch while dribbling... Quick counter attack again, de Miguel's deflected shot is saved, but Enric Gallego just slides in, anticipating the rebound, and the ball rolls over the line... Careless and reckless performance against the strongest team in the league, but like this we would've lost against any team... \n\n40' - another goal on the counter for Tenerife, but it was offside\n\n\u26bd 42' - GOLLLL DEL CASTILLA - beautiful combination by Thiago Pitarch and Manuel \u00c1ngel, and Thiago keeps calm and squares it again in the box to Loren, who only needs to pass it into the net\n\n45'+4 - penalty for Castilla after a foul on Loren, given after a lengthy review! \n\n45'+5 - Palacios takes it low, and the keeper saves... \n\nHT - spectacular first half, in which it was mostly boys vs. men for Castilla, getting obliterated on the counter - at the end of the first half, they started fighting back out of nowhere, but Palacios sadly didn't take the chance to completely get them back into this match just before half time\n\n46' - second half underway\n\n\u26bd 46' - GOLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - beautiful all-team buildup after kickoff, Cestero plays it out to David - Palacios makes a brilliant dummy run, coming towards the pass instead, takes a touch past the defender and then finishes perfectly low into the far corner - the game is back on for the second half! \n\n\ud83d\udd04 58' - Rivas on for Diego Aguado\n\n\ud83d\udd04 70' - Leiva on for Manuel \u00c1ngel \n\n\ud83d\udfe5 82' - Red card for Joan, who commits a last man foul, even though the contact was very soft... \n\n\ud83d\udd04 86' - Cestero and Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga come off for Cristian David and Lamini Fati\n\n90'+4 - penalty for Tenerife - very soft call again, Castilla have ran out of challenges though as the ref keeps on brushing them aside - just before, Palacios received a yellow for a clean challenge... \n\n\u26bd 90'+5 - Gast\u00f3n converts... \n\nFT - after a horrendous start to this match, Castilla fought their way back into the match away against dominant league leaders Tenerife - sadly, some small details including some match deciding decisions by the referee decided the match in Tenerife's favour. A draw and a loss is not the ideal start to Juli\u00e1n L\u00f3pez' Castilla era, but the match today against the dominant champions-to-be can be set aside \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 16:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Heliodoro Rodr\u00edguez L\u00f3pez, Santa Cruz de Tenerife \n\n**Referee**: Jorge T\u00e1rraga Lajara\n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 1, Matchday 21\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[LaLiga+](https://www.laligaplus.laliga.com/) (subscription - 14.99\u20ac/month) (only available in Spain)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-3-3): Fran Gonz\u00e1lez - Diego Aguado (58' Mario Rivas), V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as \u2018Valde\u2019, Joan Mart\u00ednez, David Jim\u00e9nez - Jorge Cestero (86' Cristian David), Manuel \u00c1ngel (70' \u00c1lvaro Leiva), Thiago Pitarch - C\u00e9sar Palacios, Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga (86' Lamini Fati), Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez\n\nBench: Guille S\u00fanico (GK), Jes\u00fas Fortea, Dani Mesonero, Bruno Iglesias, Pol Fortuny, \u00c1lvaro Gin\u00e9s. \n\nUnavailable: Manu Serrano (injury), Roberto Mart\u00edn (injury), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Rachad Fettal (injury). \n\nCoach: Juli\u00e1n L\u00f3pez de Lerma\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** DLWLD\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 5th | 32pt | 10-2-8 | 26:26\n",

        "content": "Many saying Xabi is to blame. No, he is not. Endrick was supposed to leave on loan at the start of season. And not giving Endrick minutes was a message to him to go on loan ASAP.\n\nThe team is fucking stacked up front. Even Gonzalo Garcia who was star of Club world cup, barely got any minutes. And Endrick was behind him in pecking order rightfully so.\n\nAlso, you guys pretending endrick is a real deal, and not mentioning to anyone that he scored that hatrick against Metz who is last in Ligue 1, and pretending that he has done something spectacular is naive and reactionary. He is showing promise, and the goals that he has scored will do him good and hopefully he continues this till the end of season. But nothing extraordinary has been done yet.\n\nAlso are you forgetting that Gonzalo Garcia scored a much better hattrick against Real Betis (much better team than Metz), for Real Fucking Madrid, and not some Lyon ?? And are you guys also ignoring the fact that Mastantuono is playing very intelligent and promising football and also working extremely hard defensively, something u can never expect Endrick to do as well ?\n\nBased on what I have seen so far, I still rate Mastantuono and Gonzalo Garcia above Endrick, and Xabi did absolutely nothing wrong.\n\nAnd in all this discussion, I have not even mentioned Brahim and Rodrygo, who deserve to start ahead of Endrick as well, especially at right wing position.",

        "content": "I think mastuono, despite his huge signing fees, is not talked enough as a youngster(mentioned signing fees because with huge fees you get more attention). For instance, he has similar or better stats than Yamal had in the first 15 games. Maybe Yamal was younger than him so we can't really compare them. Arda was the talk of football community when he signed with us, his age-18 was the highlight. Mastuono being of similar age, I don't really see him getting similar fame others before him got.\n\nAnd, I personally feel he's the proper right winger we've got since Gareth bale, a left footed right winger. Like we also had rodrygo and he was nice on the right, but him being right footed always had us lacking something during games. Mastantuono helps in so much ways, creates a balance on both sides while attacking. He runs, presses, tracks back, passes perfectly,...RUNS. Maybe he runs too much at times, but he doesn't look under confident on the pitch, and the number of fck ups are quite negligible by him.\n\nI feel like we don't talk about him enough like we did about Arda or huijsen. Or even the football media don't talk about him enough like they did with the likes of Yamal or cubarsi or pedri, etc.",

        "content": "One of the biggest thing Zidane did first and foremost in his 2016 takeover that lead to our UCL three-peat was finding his fixed Starting XI and the fundamental formation. Arbeloa's last three matches have gone really well. Starting XI is starting to form an identity and the combinations are clicking as he would have desired. But he was lucky with the suspension of Carreras and the injury of Rodrygo to find his preferred combinations where he slotted Camavinga as LB and Mastantuono as RW against Monaco - a match that proved to be our biggest win and our best performance of the last two seasons.\n\nYesterday, Tchouameni's suspension ensured that the dynamism of Camavinga was there on the pitch. Mastantuono's work ethic and pressing strengths are becoming indispensible to the team. \n\nHow do you think Arbeloa will find a way?",
