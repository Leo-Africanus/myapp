Cause how come a player with no talent outperforms players like pedri/vitinha in almost 90% of criteria stats.\n\nAnd I feel so frustrated when players say Bellingham has no technicality I mean are they even watch Some things he done on the field are so magical I can't even explain.\n\nFirst of all he is so press resistant, stays unbothered and can place a perfect pass breaking the press even if he is pressed by 5 people.\n\nBall carrying ability of him is so top notch. As soon as he starts to drive with the ball centrally opportunity starts opening up.\n\nAnd Tbh he is a solid dribbler other midfielders like vitinha, pedri, mac allister can't dribble past players like he does, even stats confirm this.\n\nHis first touch is so underrated I mean, he touched a ball in the air makesit bounce two times once on his knees second time on his foot (while doing a 360 and blistering pass players)\n\nHis tackles and defending is soo good I mean almost on par with likes of tchoumani who are proper dm's.\n\nRuns around the pitch. His tackles in the final third already made us there chance in prvs two matches.\n\nHe scores and assists more than a CAM He is as much press resistant and technical as much a ball playing CM. Defends more than a pivot.\n\nHow do people even come up with Bellingham just runs and does nothing it's pure bullshit.",

        "content": "**We ended the European matchday with three wins and two defeats, thank goodness for the Premier League.** Athletic won their match against Qarabag, who are proving to be a tough opponent, despite Nico not finding his form and his brother I\u00f1aki suffering a muscle injury. It was a comfortable and much-needed victory, which should stabilise Athletic in the competition.\n\n**But all eyes were on the Bernab\u00e9u,** where the first thing to say is that G\u00fcler has definitely won over the team. In addition to the quality of his left foot and his splendid vision, he has shown impeccable dedication, becoming the ideal Real Madrid player since the days of Di St\u00e9fano: half artist, half warrior. In addition, he is an impeccable corner kick taker, a skill he had numerous opportunities to show off in the first half. Practically all of his corners, from either side, were headed, except when he allowed himself to take an open, precise shot to Valverde to strike outside the area.\n\n**Juve made it a very difficult game for Madrid.** Very tight and sprinkling counterattacks (three very early on created panic), they were very tough to beat. Let's say, before it's too late, that Courtois was enormous. He played his 300th game and kept his 119th clean sheet. Di Gregorio was also very good, with Madrid managing to get to him only a few times, but with danger.\n\n**It took extraordinary efforts from Madrid's extraordinary players** to achieve this. In the first half, Mbapp\u00e9 made a sensational move that ended in a high shot from Militao. In the second half, a devastating move by Vinicius ended with his own shot hitting the post, which was finished off by Bellingham, who will welcome this goal. He is still not back to his best, but I have the impression that he has been improving with every game.\n\n**Mbapp\u00e9 left this time without scoring because of Di Gregorio,** who saved three superb shots, but he is still in good form. For him, trapped in the cage set up by Juve, it was a difficult night. All in all, Madrid has three wins and is among the group of co-leaders, although with a worse goal difference than others.",

        "content": "He is probably the best ball striker in our team and shoots once every leap year. Even our center backs shoot from 40 yards. Fede just turns off shooting boots off and just turns it on here and there. I personally feel he is still stuck with the Carlo gameplay. Earlier if we loose the ball it would take us a while to turn over and hence less risks on shooting and risky passes. But now we are winning balls more in the final third. When Fede starts rocketing, the defense has to come out of the line to block, that would open space. Now its more like, he is not going to shoot, so they stay back. Time for Xabi to bet his coaching career on Fede 20 goals a season!!!\n\nPS: this is not a reaction to the last min counter against JUV, but a trend i observed this season.",
