Is that a fair comparison? Does he play as a deep-lying playmaker or more of a modern box-to-box midfielder? How good is he really, and does he seem like someone who could take over that Kroos-type role we\u2019ve been missing?\n\nI haven\u2019t seen enough of him myself, so I\u2019d love to hear what you guys think, especially those who\u2019ve been following his performances more closely. \n\nHala Madrid!",

        "content": "The academy players will end up getting more chances, especially players like diego aguado(LB/CB), Manuel Angel(CM) and Thiago Pitarch(CM). Of course I think we needed another CB but maybe aguado can fill that role seeing as dortmund wanted him yet the club insisted on keeping him, and also having academy players succeed is a very positive thing for the club and fans overall. Now, successful academy players means nothing if we don't win anything though lmao so we'll see. Also I didn't include Joan Martinez because he's still recovering from the ACL so I doubt he'll be with the first team that much this season",
