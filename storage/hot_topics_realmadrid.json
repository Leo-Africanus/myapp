The team was effective with their possession, efficient in front of goal and never really got threatened in defense either, looking comfortable and a level above their opponent today. Julian L\u00f3pez de Lerma's side continue their absolutely flawless run, both in UYL with 4 wins our of 4, and in all competitions, winning their 11th of 11 matches. They are first in the league table for now, with various teams being able to go equal on points in their matches tomorrow however\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 16:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Liverpool FC Academy Training Ground, Liverpool \n\n**Referee:** Bastien Dechepy (FRA)\n\n**Competition:** UEFA Youth League, League Phase, Matchday 4\n\n**Viewing options:** [RMTV/RM PLAY](https://play.realmadrid.com/home)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Juvenil A XI (4-4-3):** Javi Navarro - Diego Aguado, Ariel Nkoghe (75' \u00c1lvaro Lezcano), Mario Rivas, Javi Bail\u00f3n - Diego Mart\u00ednez \u2018Beto\u2019, Carlos D\u00edez, Pol Dur\u00e1n (64' Izan Regueira) - Liberto Navascu\u00e9s (64' Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez), Jacobo Ortega (54' Jaime Barroso), Adri P\u00e9rez (75' Bruno Galassi) \n\nBench: Illia Voloshyn (GK), Ferran Seco, Ignacio Gasc\u00f3n, Gabri Valero. \n\nCoach: Juli\u00e1n L\u00f3pez de Lerma\n\nUYL League Phase Stats: 5th | 9pt | 3-0-0 | 8:3\n\n",
