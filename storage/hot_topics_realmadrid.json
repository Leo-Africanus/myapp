It takes one or two moments of madness or a single injury to flip their season upside down.\n\nWe still have all our knockout games ahead of us, and we have already beaten Barca this season, so that monkey is also off our back.\n\nIs there even any sense in sacking Xabi when the board has already committed to transitioning into the tactical-meta era of football?",

        "title": "There is Something Fundamentally Wrong With This Institution And It's Been Exposed",
        "content": "It's seriously concerning just how low we've fallen over the past 2 years. It's like after the double in 23/24, we've just completely and utterly forgotten the values and principles.\n\nWe won the double in 21/22 as well, thing's weren't great the years before but this time feels really off, and the main reason is the performance EVEN when we have a strong squad on paper. Why on paper? Because for some odd reason, the strongest squad is NEVER fully fit.\n\nI want to jog your memory back to the 2016/2017 season. The fact we didn't win the treble that year really ticks me off but I digress. In the 16/17 season, we effectively had 2 squads. Zidane rotated between them, and the injuries weren't as common of course counting out Bale (I feel for him icl). But more importantly, they didn't impact the squad NEARLY as much as the injuries do now.\n\nAnd that's plainly because of depth. Our starting 11 consisted of Cris, Benz, Gareth, Luka, Kroos, Case, Sergio, Pepe, Marcelo And Carva, along with Keylor in goal. Unbelievable line up. But here's the really INSANE thing. \n\nOur B team consisted of: Morata, Asensio, James, Danilo, Varane (though he was pretty much a starter too) Nacho, Kovacic, Mariano, Casilla and a few academy players.\n\nToday it could be argued we have a \"B\" team as well. The issue is that it's no longer set and stone. The injury crisis has decimated the defense and the board thinks another young defender is the way to go.\n\n  \nWe've let go of all veterans that could steer the ship, and that too in quick succession. I still cannot fathom we let Luka of all people leave so soon. We've lost experience AND hunger because I'm sorry, for players that have won 2 champions leagues, they sure as hell aren't showing it. It's baffling. \n\nPerhaps they're tired, perhaps there's something else, who knows\n\nNow our board has decided Xabi has to go because he's not getting the results. Just months ago they had decided Ancelotti was no longer getting the results and should go, coming off the back of a double AND riddled with injuries. The next coach will be someone else who they also deem inadequate. \n\nAnd a final note, Vinicius should be sold end of. He's my favorite player on the team, but his behavior has gotten to the point where nobody benefits any longer. It allows for the media to leech to the team and you best believe it affects the players even if they say it doesn't. It's impossible to avoid the noise, and speaking in the most blunt and unbiased way I possibly can. He's no longer the player that won us those 2 champions leagues, and there has been no change in attitude that would give a person faith that he can regain that form. Saudi want him its obvious, we take the money now and be done with it, or have a saga that will destabilize the team further WHILE we lose money.  \n  \nAlonso IS the man for the job. Ancelotti WAS the man for the job. We cannot make the same mistake a third time, punishing the coach for a collective issue with the institution and protecting the players who play a massive role in said issue.\n\nChange is needed now, otherwise in this modern era, we aren't gonna achieve the success we're used to.",

Yes the results suck recently and yes we must have high standards but the project just started and needs time, get your heads out of your ass and stand behind our players. At the end of the season we can pass judgment and demand changes as needed, meanwhile we must support our club and stop those who want to divide us from achieving their objective..\n\nHala Madrid !",

So now let's not act like losing Kroos and Modric wasn't as impactful either. Trust the process. New manager, some new players, new formations to try out. We'll come back stronger. Hala Madrid.",
