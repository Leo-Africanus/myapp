We renew him for 5/6 years. He'll play 2 more good seasons and then when he's past that 27 y/o his burst speed is gone and he'lls Slowly get worse. Now we stuck with him and huge salary instead of refreshing the squad. \n\nThis is why vini leaving is better, despite me thinking he'll overcome his bad form. ",

        "content": "We lost with a horrible performance yesterday, and it hurts a lot, especially when it\u2019s against a team that is fighting relegation. But football is unpredictable. Even big clubs like PSG, who once won the sextuple and were considered unstoppable, are now struggling and sitting around 11th place. This shows that no team stays at its peak forever and that some matches are simply tough \u2014 not just physically, but mentally as well. Players are human. They feel pressure, fatigue, criticism, and expectations. They don\u2019t step onto the pitch wanting to lose. They want to win because victories bring pride, recognition, and satisfaction, not just money. When things go wrong, it\u2019s often more about confidence and mentality than a lack of effort.\n\nIt\u2019s easy for fans to say that players are only here for money, but the reality is more complex. Many of these players receive massive offers from Saudi clubs and elsewhere, yet they still choose to play for Real Madrid because of what this club represents. Yes, the loss hurts deeply \u2014 I couldn\u2019t sleep properly either \u2014 but we have to remember that they lost too, and it hurts them as well. Booing our own players only makes things worse. Just like we expect support from friends and family when we are at our lowest, our team also deserves backing during difficult times. This is their club as much as it is ours, and standing by them now is what true support really means.",

Yeah, he knows what to do with the ball, but under pressure he crumbles. He has no physical and he gets bullied of the ball easily. Then we have Alaba, Ceballos, and Mendy who just occupy space on the bench or in the hospital. When it comes to actual World Class players we only have two, Courtouis and Mbappe. How did we get to the point where we need to overhaul midfield, defense and the right wing? Our situation will not start to change until we get rid of players who bring nothing, and start bringing PROVEN players. Not some 17 year old South American, but someone who we know for a fact is good. The fact we did not even try to get Guehi still haunts me, and we dropped 60 on mastantuono, crazy. ",

And it's clear he's gonna say that for all future disappointment. \nBut respectfully, if it's your fault, then why are you on the job? If you're admitting that you are the reason we're out of copa and out of top 8 after being 3rd.Then leave and let soemone better. \n\nTldr: if it's your fault then gtfo",

        "content": "If Jude isn't playing as an 8 then Guler and Mastantuono needs to be replaced by proper midfielders. But you can't have Guler and Jude together without another midfielder besides Tchouameni to help cover. We need balance, these are football fundamentals. Those are the things Xabi always looked out for causing frustration from players who didn't care about the structure of the team. In 23/24 champions final we had 4 midfielders playing Kroos, Cama, Valverde, and Jude with Modric Tchouameni Ceballos on the bench too. In 21/22 we had 4 again with Valverde, Kroos, Modric and Casemiro with Cama and Ceballos on the bench. In 17/18 and 16/17 again 4 with Isco, Kroos, Modric, and Casemiro.  And now we have only Jude and Tchouameni as starting midfielders with Cama on the bench and Fede at right back. We need a strong middle class, if not the system fails with defenders becoming exposed and attackers don't get any service. ",

        "content": "This is by no means our biggest problem right now but game after game I feel that Valverde and Vinicius are not fit to captain this club, especially after shit last night where they want to run back to the changing room and hide from the fans and Courtois is screaming at them to face the fans. \n\nHow many times have Vinicius and Valverde faced the media after a loss? It's a joke, it's always Courtois and he always speaks truthfully, analyticaly and being self-critical. \n\nHe's the only one with the experience and maturity (apart from Carvajal but he never plays) to actually lead this team.\n\nThen again... The armband probably doesn't mean anything to these brats. ",
