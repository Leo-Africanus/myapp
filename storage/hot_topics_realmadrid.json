        "content": "I can\u2019t imagine a more perfect image of Real Madrid and Zidane than this one. This is perfection.\n\nFirst, let's start with the kit. Plain white, not stained by any sponsor (sorry I am a purist), retro look with collars for our centenary year, full sleeve- absolutely timeless. Love it. Then, the stage itself. it is the champions league final- the competition that best defines us as a club like no other. We'll never be satisfied even if we win 20 more than everyone else.\n\nNext, the man who scored this- Zizou. The marquee signing, the highest transfer in the world at this moment. The fact that he would later return as manager and lead us to glory makes it all the more poetic that he was the one to score this goal. The love and gratitude he has shown fopr the club over the years is immense.\n\nAnd finally, the goal itself. Roberto Carlos sends a hopeful cross at the edge of the box. The ball rises into the night so high up, hangs impossibly long, and begins to fall behind Zidane. Zizou waits- still, patient and calm just like the person he is. No defender rushes, no challenge comes. It is as though time itself has paused for him and he knows it. Then\u2014one perfect swing of his weaker foot no less and the contact is so well timed. Bam. Golazooo.\n\nDimitar Berbatov later said he got the perfect view of the goal and he just wanted to clap even though he was playing for the opposition team. And really, can you blame him? Who wouldn't?\n\nThank you Zizou, you are a gem. So thankful that Florentino passed that napkin to Zizou in the UCL awards function with the message of Real Madrid interest and Zizou said yes without a second thought.",

        "content": "  Real Madrid Castilla (the reserve team) sent Jeremy de Leon (lucky charm guy) to Hercules de Alicante (a third division team) for the 2025-26 season (basically a year)\n\n\n  Hopefully he'll get better there I guess. He was probably sent there due to his injuries and his absence to football. This'll probably be good for him to get better after being out for so long. I also read he just wasn't in the teams plans for Real Madrid Castilla. I don't know, he kind of represents Puerto Rico in football so he better tighten tf up \ud83d\ude24\n\n\n  His first match for them will probably be around mid September when he's ready to play. He's already done some training for the team, so yeah hopefully he'll be good.\n ",

If they can do it consistenly through the whole season especially in big games, the team will be a lot better for it.",

        "title": "Mbappe's positioning as number 9",
        "content": "I have seen a lot of people asking Mbappe to essentially stay as a box striker, staying central and upfront in between the two posts. He does this at times, but also drifts around to try and link play or connect with teammates, or take the ball and drive.\n\nIn my opinion, forcing Mbappe to play as a box striker negates the reason for getting a player like him, Mbappe is one of the most dynamic forwards not only in world football now but of the last 20-25 years. He is dangerous everywhere in the final third. His 3 goals so far this season show that, winning a penalty with a dribble from the right side, spinning a defender in the middle and scoring vs Oviedo, and finishing off a transition on the left. He literally scored over 7 goals from outside of the box last season, similar to Valverde, the highest number in Europe. Limiting him to a box striker negates a lot of that, and he isn't a hold up play striker who plays with his back to goal like Benzema or Morata, Mbappe is at his best in space, or with the ball at his feet. You have arguably the best player in the world, when has a team ever had the best player in the world and not play to his strengths.\n\nThe two main problems this gives Madrid is:\n\n1. Whos in the box if hes drifting around, against teams who just sit, a box presence or target in the box is needed to occupy defenders and give the wingers someone to aim crosses at\n2. Vinicius Jr and Mbappe both excel from the same positions on the pitch, the left half space. Also Vinicius impact decreases when he doesn't have someone to aim for and play off centrally. Both Vini and Mbappe play better with someone to play off of (Link player, e.g Jude 23/24, Benzema)\n\nOne solution to both of these problems that not a lot of people brings up is Jude Bellingham. When Mbappe drifts out, Jude Bellingham is a perfect box presence and can rotate with Mbappe to play inbetween the defenders. He is a brilliant link up player, physical, great in the air and in the box, and can hold the ball well. The main problem last year when Jude did this was there wasn't enough technical players in midfield in my opinion, so when he went up, sometimes Madrid struggled to create in midfield, but with the addition of Arda (and hopefully Alex Arnold gets back to his level), then that creation is there, so in the times where Jude goes in the box (with or without Kylian), there is still creativity in midfield.\n\nFor me, Jude Bellingham is the key to bring balance back into the side, creation from the left can come from Vini/Mbappe/Carreras, creation from middle from Arda/Jude and Dean, and from the right hopefully Trent/Arda/Fede. This is against the teams who defend deep, Madrid struggle against these teams. Rodrygo is fantastic at link up and is a different profile than Vini, he links well with Kylian and Jude. Question now is can Vini get back to his level, improve the link up play with Kylian, his cameo vs Oviedo hopefully is a step in the right direction.",
