No major upsets and controversial predictions in the group stages.   \n  \nIn the R16, I predict River Plate to knock out Dortmund, unfortunately one of the biggest chokers in Europe. I expect Adeyami to miss 5+ shots including sitters and then maybe a 1-0 for River Plate on the counter. \n\nIn QF, the highest paid coach of world football will use his haramball tactics to kick out Bayern, assuming Musiala doesn't play in proper form. With Muller leaving and them failing to get Wirtz and Nico Williams, with them losing Kim while Kompany is still their manager, I expect ATM to win this. Not to mention that Sorloth and Alvarez are amazing right now and we can never sleep on Griezmann. No other upset.\n\nIn the SF, I again would say that since Pep's tactics are now no longer that good, with Crystal Palace and multiple PL clubs being able to tackle it with tier 2 players, I would say ATM would again play a low block and defend for their lives. Sorloth/Alvarez will go on to score in one of their counter plays and then park an aeroplane in front of the bus. The match will also get violent for sure but Simeone wins. As for Madrid and PSG, I do not have conviction that Madrid would win but you wouldnt expect me to be a fan and say PSG would win right xd? This is a new madrid and PSG haven't started training for the CWC, Enrique is not taking this very seriously, although their squad is young and hungry. Let's just assume for our sake Madrid wins.\n\nFinals - No upset here, we don't lose finals and we don't lose to Atleti in international competitions. \n\nThoughts?",

Alaba scored 2.\n\nActually it already dropped since Ronaldo's late seasons.\n\nNow we got Arnold. Mbappe is also showing promise, he could continue to improve on it. Maybe Guler could also try to work on his direct free kick? His indirect freekick is very good.\n\nThe new wonderkid is good at it as well?",

        "content": "As a long time supporter of Real Madrid only situation that made me as excited about new season was that summer 2009 when Kaka, Xabi, C. Ronaldo and Benzema were signed. \n\nFlorentino Perez returned and you could feel that was a beginning, a foundation of something great after years of terrible results in CL.\n\nGranted, they didn't succeed instantly, but that was the beginning of a project that would bring us La Decima and then three peat CL.\n\nI kinda have the same feeling again with Xabi. And it's not because of the players that were brought, although they are great.\n\nIt's more the feeling that our play style will change, have more structure, more team play, cohesion, pressing and less individuality.\n\nYou can see the club is really learning on mistakes, especially with the ridiculous number of injuries. New people are brought, with new, modern training techniques to solve that issue.\n\nThey also seem to listen Xabi and don't make problems for him regarding strengthening the positions in team that were disregarded for so long.\n\nIt looks like this could be the start of a new successful era, but again so many things can go wrong (hopefully not). What do you think?",
