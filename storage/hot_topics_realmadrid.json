        "content": "Full transcript: \n\nCristiano Ronaldo: \n\u201cAt Real Madrid, for example, I remember when I missed a chance or a penalty I would be so angry with myself. I didn't allow myself to make mistakes. I would go to bed without dinner, and talk to myself, wondering why I shot to the right or to the left. I don't regret being like that.\n\nEverything that happens on the field, stays on the field. I can't get home with my football problems with my family. But at first it was very difficult. I missed an opportunity or penalty and I locked myself in my room and talked to myself. I was sick.\n\nMbapp\u00e9 is fast, powerful, he has speed\u2026 He can\u2019t wait in the box. He has to stay out and appear. If I did it, can\u2019t Mbapp\u00e9 do it? Real Madrid have to protect him.\n\nVin\u00edcius should have won the Ballon d'Or, but I'm not surprised, there is no credibility, I was very disappointed, he deserved it.\n\nJude Bellingham reminds me a lot of Zidane, he has some Zidane elements. He will give a lot to Madrid, because he will be a star.\n\nI like the fact that Real Madrid fans miss me. My home is Spain, I played for Madrid for many years, it was where I was happiest. Real Madrid was always in my heart.\n\nMy son Mateo really likes Bellingham, Camavinga, Mbapp\u00e9.\n\nI achieved beautiful things at Madrid and people don\u2019t forget that, that makes me happy.\n\nI respect Perez, he is a trustworthy president and a serious person, and he treated me well. We won many titles with him, and I respect him a lot.\n\nI loved playing in the Camp Nou. They booed me, they insulted me, and I LOVED that.\n\nYou may prefer Pele, Messi, Maradona, I understand and respect that.\n\nI have a very good relationship with Messi, I was his translator at some awards ceremonies.\n\nAt one point I was at Sporting and I managed to go to Barcelona, \u200b\u200bthey wanted to sign me.\u201d\n\nIt didn't happen, because they wanted to sign me the following year and United came and signed me.\n\nI enjoyed scoring goals more at the Camp Nou than at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u. When you are warming up and they are already whistling at you, that\u2019s what I love. That\u2019s the best part of football for me.\u201d\n\nMadrid - Barcelona atmosphere and the relationship with Messi?\n\nCristiano Ronaldo:\n\n\u201cIt was a historic rivalry, Madrid-Barcelona, \u200b\u200bCristiano-Messi, Ramos-Pique.\n\nIt was very nice I had a very good relationship with Messi and I once translated it into some awards and all that before the ceremony started He has always treated me well and I hope we see our numbers again, but I find it very difficult\u201d\n\n\u201cI appreciate and respect Florentino, I speak to him sometimes and I don't rule out coming back one day when I finish my career and do something great.\u201d\n\n\u201cI left Real Madrid because I wanted a new chapter.\n\nIn the negotiations phase when I was leaving Real Madrid, Florentino did not behave well with me. I understood that, because that is always his style.\n\nI told Perez about it, he accepted, but later he tried to come back, and there was no going back for me, because I had given my word to Juventus.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm happy people still remember that I did important and beautiful things and that's why people don't forget when you leave a mark.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpain is my homeland, my children were born there, and I will always have Real Madrid in my heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really like Carlo Ancelotti, he is an amazing person, we have won a lot of things together.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Hear me out,\n\nAlot of the other top teams in Europe have been able to integrate their Youth players into their their starting team, except us.\n\nAncelloti's demands for the club to sign players to increase our squad depth is UNREALISTIC. Players like Asensio, Nico Paz, Ramon and many others have been in our Youth team for years. The integration should have started years ago, players like Ramon and Asensio should have been given solid minutes last year so that they have been ready to start this year.\n\nWe honestly wasted years of youth squad integration because Carlo only likes to play his fav. 14-15 players.\n\nThe players are there, our Youth System is as strong as ANY other team.\n\nI hate to say it but look at Barcelona, They have created gems out of their youth. couple of years ago even their most loyal fan did not know half of these starting players are. Look at them now, almsot their entire team is from their Youth Squad. Yamal, Cubarasi, Balde, Pedri, Gavi...etc.\n\n\\------------------------------------------\n\nSolution to long term injuries should ALWAYS be from the Youth System, It is Ancelloti's failure to not integrate our youth team.\n\nTop players like Militao, Alaba, Rudiger are still on the club's payroll. Expecting to sign a worldclass CB on a long contract is not realistic. \n\nAsensio has shown he can be a Main team material, we probably have couple of more players like that.\n\nOur youth players have been scouted by the very best, they deserve a chance. It is crazy that a player like Fortea forces himself to leave the club cuz he knows he wont get a chance here.",

Madrid has to help him, protect him, and I have no doubt that he will give a lot of joy to the Real Madrid fans.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love him a lot because not only because of the history he had as a youngster where he loved Cristiano a lot and was his idol, but it is because I truly see him, I see him as a star and I think that he will give a lot of joy to Real Madrid.\u201d",

This is the first time I see the club doing something like this. The board must be furious after these decisions, it's not the first time the VAR is pretending to be asleep.. not only they turn blind eyes on these fouls, but the 2 times Mbapp\u00e9 was on side, yet the VAR checked only the frame AFTER the ball was passed and Mbapp\u00e9 is offside.. and this right here could have easily ended Mbapp\u00e9's career. the tackle was horrible ! \n\nWhat are your thoughts on the club posting this ?

        "content": "In the past 5 seasons Real Madrid hasn't purchased or signed new players as much as they used to in the last 2 decades, recently it was mostly loan returns or buy-back options or signing free players.\n\nfor example during 2010-2011 Winter market we brought Adebayor on loan despite having both Benzema and Higuain who were physically fine. and on 2008-2009 season Van nistelrooy, de la red, and Diarra missed out the remainder of the season due to injuries and the management brought replacements (Huntelaar, Lassana, Parejo, and Faubert) even though they weren't useful.\n\nbut now we don't have Carvajal and Militao for the remainder of this season and our management don't want to sign any new players even temporarily as loans.\n\nReal Madrid is entitled to have 25 players registered in the first team, but we have 22 now with shirt numbers 12,24,and 25 available. or maybe i should say 21 as Vallejo is a bench warmer and never used not even in easier copa games.\n\nso what are the reasons? is it money? is it greed of players and their agents? is it Ancelotti? is it Perez?",
