        "title": "Individual Brilliance vs Individual Disaster in the UCL",
        "content": "Raul has been crap recently, don\u2019t get me wrong here. He needs to be better and I wish him a speedy recovery from his injury and hope he can get back into form.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what I want to talk about today. I\u2019m not trying to spin the bullshit narrative of \u201coh he\u2019s only 23 years old, give him time.\u201d I think his ceiling is a solid squad player for us, not a future pillar of our backline, and that\u2019s okay.\n\nBut despite his woes, he did not cost us the game. One thing that became apparent after watching some of these other CL playoff ties is individual brilliance and individual disasters.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Atalanta and Dortmund. Bensebaini completely lost the tie for Dortmund. He was at fault for the very first goal, basically pulling the same shitty sliding interception that Raul did against Benfica. But he continued to get cooked all game. Despite that, Adeyami and his individual brilliance still tied the game\u2026 until Bensebaini conceded the game-losing PK. Shout our Beier for having a good game too but Carnedeschi for an even better one.\n\nNext up, we got PSG vs Monaco. I\u2019ll straight up say it Desire Doue is a fucking baller who single-handedly won Paris this tie across two legs. If I could have any PSG player on Madrid, it would be Vitinha ofc but the most realistic I honestly could see us getting Doue as our future winger and in like 3-4 years and I would love that. But despite that, Doue could not do it all by himself. Nope, he had Mamadou Coulibaly to thank for that. First,t missing a wide open sitter in the opening minutes before losing his head. I honestly thought his first yellow was deserving of a red. It was high and reckless. And then minutes later, he makes another late challenge like a bozo. I haven\u2019t seen a team since prime Barca or Bayern to take advantage of 10 men like PSG does. Shout out to Akliouche for even giving Monaco a chance against the reigning champs.\n\nThen we have Juve vs Galatasaray. I feel bad for Juve I really do. What a performance by the team. I wish I watched it live instead of Real Madrid ngl. But I do not feel bad for Lloyd Kelly, and honestly, I\u2019ll go ahead and lump Cabral in there too. Kelly, whether you think that last foul is a straight red, a yellow, or no foul at all it doesn\u2019t really matter to me. Because his first yellow was a foul, it was sloppy and a deserved yellow. When that happens, you have to be careful and Kelly was not. Same with Cabral, two yellows in a span of 30 minutes is inexcusable. It\u2019s simple football IQ that honestly I think our team has, when you get a yellow chill the fuck out a bit. Shout out to Osimhen tho. This was no world-class performance. I think Gatti held him in check well for the majority of the game. But when every other Gala player was a 5/10 or worse, Osimhen did his job. Continued to occupy the CBs, pose danger on the counter, battle for headers, and eventually got the game-winning goal in ET. He simply looked a class above everyone else on his team.\n\nSo yeah we have Madrid players who you might think aren\u2019t up to our standard or are out of form or on decline. But we will usually have more individual brilliance than our opponents. And less individual disasters too. And call is \u201cblack magic\u201d or \u201cmentalidad\u201d; that final statement only seems more true when we reach the knockout stages.\n\nHALA MADRID!",
