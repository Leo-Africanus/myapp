        "content": "#FT: JUVENIL A 0:2 AZ \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#UEFA YOUTH LEAGUE \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:**\n\n0:1 Wassim Bouziane 30'\n\n0:2 Anthony Smits 87'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - kickoff, vamos! \n\n3' - the earlier matches just finished, and if they pass,  the team will face Man City's U19s in the quarter final\n\n8' - DISGRACEFUL by the AZ player, who tries putting pressure on our keeper \u00c1lvaro and elbows him in the face fully on purpose - no card given, it should've easily been a red \n\n11' - now van de Ban, the same player who should've seen red sees a yellow for a late tackle - so even if the refs had spotted it but not deemed it on purpose, it would've been a second yellow now\n\n20' - first chances for Juvenil A - Jacobo connects with a cross from the left by Aguado, but his shot is wide - Y\u00e1\u00f1ez' shot from outside the box is easily saved by the keeper\n\n\u26bd 30' - pretty much the first arrival at our box by AZ and the goal arrives, always the same story - our defenders let an AZ player enter the box easily, \u00c1lvaro saves his shot but parries it away badly to Bouziane in the box, Rivas leaves him all the time in the world to take the ball down and shoot, leaving \u00c1lvaro without a chance on the rebound\n\n36' - yellow for Diego Aguado who trips the AZ player, he was technically the last man, but the ball was going towards the corner flag. We are not defending well on the counter \n\n41' - Penalty for Juvenil A after the AZ player slips and basically buries the ball under his arms\n\n42' - de Llanos with awful fan, easy save for the keeper, then Y\u00e1\u00f1ez misses the rebound... What is wrong with this team...\n\n44' - HOW?? Triple chance from a very short distance after a corner... De Llanos' shot is blocked, then Jacobo Ortega's shot is saved by the keeper with a great reaction, and a third shot from an even shorter distance is cleared off the line, unbelievable \n\n45'+1 - Roberto is semingly tripped in the box, referee doesn't point to the spot, but it looks like Roberto is injured \n\nHT - Just unbelievable that the team is not only not leading comfortably, but trailing after this first half... An awful penalty by de Llanos, multiple wasted chances including an incredible triple chance, and AZ score with their first attack after bad goalkeeping... It feels like every year we see these same type of matches in UYL, this utter dominance is not enough if the players don't stay composed in the key moments\n\n46' - 2nd half underway \n\n47' - \u00c1lvaro parries a shot away for a corner, but it would've went wide anyway \n\n62' - next incredible miss... Corner that Jacobo Ram\u00f3n perfectly redirects onto de Llanos, who only has to head it into the net, but puts it far wide from a short distance... \n\n\ud83d\udd04 62' - Jacobo Ortega off for Thiago Pitarch\n\n66' - next big chance, great play through the middle where de Llanos lays it off to Roberto Mart\u00edn, he has space to aim for the corner inside the box, but he puts it straight at the keeper... \n\n71' - Free kick in a central position, but Roberto Mart\u00edn puts it wide\n\n\ud83d\udd04 76' - Pol Rivera for Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez... Time is starting to run out\n\n81' - headers by Rivas and Valde go wide after corners, but the team is not creating enough danger right now... \n\n\ud83d\udd04 83' - last sub and it's an attacking one, Barroso for Cestero\n\n85' - I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHIG LIKE IT - multiple blocked shots, Roberto gets some space and shoots, the keeper saves it, but it drops for Valdepe\u00f1as, who only needs to tap it into the empty net, but he puts it wide! \n\n\u26bd 87' - Goal for AZ with their first chance in this half too... I've never, ever, ever seen anything like it \n\nFT - incredible, just incredible - I thought I've seen it all with our U19 sides, every year is the same story, dominate your opponent for 90 minutes and still somehow manage to lose, but today was the most incredible and unlikely match I've (maybe ever) seen, with the penalty and it's rebound, the triple chance, the open goal miss by Valde, and countless other blocked and saved shots, we must've had 5+ xG and didn't manage to score a single goal, all while conceding 2 from 3 attacks by AZ who were lucky to not have their attacker sent off after the first 10 minutes\n\nThe team is eliminated from UEFA Youth League against a vastly inferior opposition after the Round of 16... The truth is, after his first season, Arbeloa's teams have been nothing but disappointment after disappointment, early eliminations from UYL and Copa two years in a row, potentially bottling the league to Atleti two years in a row, but today no one can blame him, the team was prepared perfectly and on a normal fay this match would end something like 4-0 or 5-1\n\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 16:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee:** Milo\u0161 Milanovi\u0107 (SRB) \n\n**Competition:** UEFA Youth League, Round of 16, Single-leg \n\n**Viewing options:** [RMTV/RM Play (potentially VPN needed)](https://www.realmadrid.com/real-madrid-tv)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Juvenil A XI (5-2-3):** \n\u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez - V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as \u2018Valde\u2019, Diego Aguado, Jacobo Ram\u00f3n, Mario Rivas, Jes\u00fas Fortea - Jorge Cestero (83' Jaime Barroso), Roberto Mart\u00edn - Hugo de Llanos, Jacobo Ortega (62' Thiago Pitarch), Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (76' Pol Rivera) \n\nBench: Diego Arroyo (GK), Melvin Ukpeigbe, Lamini Fati, \u00c1lvaro Lezcano, Izan Regueira, Aimar Santiago. \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n\n**UYL League Phase stats:** 6th | 12pt | 4-0-2 | 10:5\n",

Back story: this was in Costa rica, i remember walking around a market with my grandpa when suddenly i saw a guys store across the street  selling soccer jerseys. I immediately begged my grandpa to go see them  &amp; when we got there i asked if he had #9. Fenomeno was my favorite at the time. He said unfortunately he didnt but had #5 along with others i dont remember but of course as soon as i heard #5 (Zidane) i was ecstatic &amp; had to get that one. Looking back i think it was some sort of knock off but i don\u2019t care i loved that jersey and will always love mi Madrid\ud83e\udd0d\n\n1st pic- April 1, 04- Coronado, San Jose, Costa Rica\n2nd pic- April 28, 04 Temecula, California, USA\n",

Now I don\u2019t have the exact stats for this season but I feel it is extremely low. \n\nMy point is we have rudiger, tchouameni, bellingham even asencio who are tall mfs and it seems like still we are not able to convert even once direct from a corner, regardless of the opposition capability to defend corners.\n\nI think we get scored against via corners much more than scoring ourselves.\n\nIs it the delivery, heading ability, or just bad luck.\n\nAlso, I know corners are not beautiful to watch, but its great to have a goal from them when the game is not going in your favour (which is happening more often this season)",

Same with Vini, he went from Ballon D'or being amazing for so long, don't let a few bad games change this. People really think they should be benched for Endrick and Arda for a few games?! Arda Guler has been trash all season and we saw how Endrick is not yet a starter-level player. Vinicius and Mbapp\u00e9 are two of the best players in the world, we need to relax and stop changing our opinions every single week. Y'all only remember the good moments and forget that Ronaldo, Bale, Benzema etc all had bad games at times. So stop getting mad at our two best players, and wait until Vini and Mbappe start to cook.",

It's a shame he is not able to play a lot more because of Rodrygo and Bellingham. I was thinking with Ceballos out, we could do someone with as good composure as Brahim. I know he is more of an attacker, but Camavinga isn't cutting it atm and Modric is old. Ancelotti is known for making players work in different position so he could do it with Brahim too? ",
