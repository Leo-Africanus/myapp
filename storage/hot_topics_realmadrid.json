One of my best friends (also a big madrid fan) and I are both getting married this summer and I was thinking about planning a trip with the rest of our friends group. Then I saw that VIP tickets were selling for 450\u20ac. It's a huge amount of money for both of us especially with the upcoming wedding costs but you only live once right? I called him and he said \"f*ck it let's do it\". 30 minutes later everything was booked (tickets, plane, airbnb). I feel like I'm drowning with happiness.\n Anyway, I never went to madrid and I want to make the most out of it. we'll be traveling from 3. March to 6. March. Can anyone please advise me on what to do especially on game day and the day after? where and when should we go to enjoy the vip experience? Is there a chance to meet former players and/or coaches? I want to enjoy this experience as much as possible as it's a once in a lifetime experience for me. I would be very grateful for any tips. I hope to be a lucky charm for the team and I promise I will sing my lungs out with every chant. Hala Madrid!",
