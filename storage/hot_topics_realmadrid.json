If we play with 3 midfielders, we shouldn\u2019t start both Valverde and Tchouam\u00e9ni together since neither is very comfortable on the ball. Instead, we should pair Bellingham and Arda G\u00fcler for control and creativity, with either Valverde or Tchouam\u00e9ni alongside them for ball-winning. Bellingham should play as a CM, while G\u00fcler plays higher up as the AM to avoid being bullied physically deeper. This setup gives us both ball control and defensive stability. However, if we go with a 4-man diamond, then both Valverde and Tchouam\u00e9ni can fit in",

        "content": "After our back to back wins, i have been thinking about our lineup after bellingham comes back from the injuries. Ideally, i think the best lineup we would have at our disposal is the current defense, midfield of tchoumeni, valverde and Arda and an attack of Bellingham, Mbappe and Vini. I think that playing Bellingham in the central role would be perfect for our team to utilize those dangerous crosses from Trent(we don't have any attackers in the box when we cross) . Also, bellingham can play as a CM when arda or valverde is pushing high. Mbappe being Mbappe will thrive on either side of the wing and we also know what vinicius is capable of when he is in form . Also when we play a high pressing team , we can switch Arda for Ceballos as the closet player we have that is press resistant and control the tempo is him.  There are so many qualities and depth right now in our team I fear there will be problems in the dressing room due to the lack of playing time once everyone is fit. What do you guys think?",

The little intricate plays in tight spaces, the runs, the passing, movement and swagger this club has been known for feels like it's coming back and that was show in the marcelo like passing from Trent, the Ronaldo like chop from Vini and the ramos esque passing from Dean. \n\nThe results are obviously vital and very important but I urge the fanbase to give Xabi and the players time, let them cook and to support them when they eventually struggle but I believe sooner rather than later we will become a dominant force again.\n\nHala Madrid!",

        "content": "The video criticizes the lack of decision and his lack of offensive effort without the ball.\n\nI think it's because of Mbappe's goalscoring instinct.  During the whole action he only thought about how he could score a goal himself.He was waiting for Vini to pass to the left so he could receive a cross and score.You don't score so many goals without having a great goalscoring instinct (32 goals in 35 matches is incredible).\n\nBut the problem is that he didn't think for a second that he wasn't the other 4 options during the counterattack:\nIf he had made a call to the left it could have created space for the player on the right \nIf he made a call to the right it would have created space for the player on the left \nIf he makes a call at the start of the action (vini seemed to be waiting for that) he could have been served in depth \nOr even Vini could have had plenty of space if the defenders misunderstood each other during Mbappe's deep run. \n\nI guess he thinks like that because he was often the only serious attacking option at PSG (Neymar was very often injured and Messi scored 7 goals during his first season at PSG) It would be good for the team if he made more offensive effort without the ball, I mean vini's goal is almost lucky (his luck = talent)\n\nAnd a question for the moderators: is it forbidden to make posts to talk about tactics outside of live matches? I mean one of my posts was deleted for no reason even though I just talked about tactics and was respectful/didn't insult anyone/no swear words/nothing +18\n\nIf it's forbidden for you, it would be cool to remove the ban, We always get better football analyses when we're not in the emotion of the live match.",

I don\u2019t really want to risk a design I\u2019ll regret later, and since this club has been a huge part of my life, it feels like the safest choice.\n\nI don\u2019t want a big detailed crest or anything too flashy \u2014 more like minimal black ink, something simple but meaningful. I\u2019ve been playing around with a few ideas:\n\t\u2022\tJust a crown outline, inspired by the one on the badge \ud83d\udc51\n\t\u2022\tThe founding year in Roman numerals (MCMII)\n\t\u2022\tA small football with a crown above it\n\t\u2022\t\u201cRM\u201d in a clean font, maybe with a crown on top\n\nThe thing I like about these is they don\u2019t scream \u201cfootball tattoo\u201d to everyone. Like, if someone doesn\u2019t know, it just looks like a crown or some numbers. But for me, it will always be about Madrid \u2014 history, greatness, loyalty, and the club\u2019s mentality of never giving up.\n\nPlacement-wise, I\u2019m leaning toward inside forearm, wrist, or back of the arm near the elbow. Basically somewhere that\u2019s not too loud but still visible when I want it to be.\n\nI\u2019m curious what you guys think. If you had to pick one of these designs, which would you say has the most long-term value? Has anyone here already gotten a Real Madrid tattoo? If yes, do you still love it or does it feel different with time?\n\nWould love to see pics if anyone wants to share too. Just trying to make sure I lock in something I\u2019ll be proud of forever",

Carreras kept the lead alive with a jaw-dropping goal-line clearance, and Tchouam\u00e9ni quietly dictated midfield rhythm. Xabi\u2019s plan worked early, though a shaky set-piece showed there\u2019s still work to do. Cooling breaks turned sparks into goals, and the bench added energy when needed.\n\nA win earned, lessons noted, and sparks of brilliance all around.\n\nWe\u2019ve broken down every performance, player by player.\n\nVini reached 100G/A for Madrid, who's next?\n\n\\- MadridNoir \ud83e\udd0d\ud83d\udc51",
