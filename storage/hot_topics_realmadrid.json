Winning the Champions League with Inter is not the same as winning it with Real Madrid. And you might say that I was at Real Madrid and I didn't win the Champions League. No, I didn't, but I won the league title and the cup title against the best team in the world, which was Barcelona, and I broke a huge cycle of Barcelona dominating Real Madrid. Also my last European title with Roma, which is Roma's only ever European title. Having not only the number of titles I have but also the way I have done it in, if you don't think I'm one of the greatest, I have to disagree.\"",

        "title": "I think the diamond midfield could be the way to go whenever facing a low block like Osasuna. Or worst case, Arsenal/Atleti",
        "content": "\nLet me explain, One glaring problem I noticed against Osasuna is how useless trent x Brahim was. Brahim isn't good enough and  against a low block, Trents best method of delivering crosses, was utterly useless as the box had just one of our players in at the maximum.\n\nAlso, in this formation Ideally I would have Bellingham at at the top of the diamond with CVT as the supporting cast. In the current situation, My pick would be Gonzalo for that AM position and of course Arda as that LCM. Vini and K10 would be the front two.  \n\nWhy think this would be particularly useful against low blocks is because as there are no actual wingers, the full backs primarily occupy the flanks and are in pole crossing position. Now, the reason I chose Gonzalo at head of the diamond as a replacement to Jude is because of their competence in the air.  Whenever the full backs are in crossing position, Gonzalo is in prime position to make a run in for a high cross. Now, a cross doesn't necessarily have to be a high cross. This is where Arda and Valverde come in. One trait of Fede that I've seen become rarely utilised is his runs into the box, a well executed to through ball to Fede near the edge of the box or even inside it makes it the perfect opportunity for him to deliver a powerful low cross with 3 forwards to connect. Arda is excellent at picking out players from the vicinity of the box and with Gonzalo being a genuine goal threat along side Vini, that is also a good opportunity for him to initiate the movement of the ball through the middle if the fullbacks are being closed down tighter. Valverde is the wildcard in this setup here, as he can get often overlooked even though he is a good shooter. Vini and Mbappe are not good arially but that doesn't mean they're threats when it comes to crosses, which is why cross and inshallah would not be a bad option. Also this drags defenders away from Valverde and Arda who are good shooters themselves.\n\n\nAlso another part of this I want to mention is that when defending Valverde stays wide and possibly high considering how strong the opponent left side attack is. He's a strong and Fast player who will assist better in counter attacks. But then again Fede is often someone that can handle a more defensive role while still being quick enough to be part of the counter\n\n\nWhat do you guys think about it?",

        "content": "Vini in the first half of 24/25 was literally the best he's probably been in his career so far,  he was amazing in every game ( except for the clasico but everyone was horrendous that game) and don't just watch the stats because even though his stats were also very good, they don't tell the full story. He was creating multiple chances for mbappe each game and all that. Then after the balon dor he had a good game against Milan, hattrick against osasuna, assist against leganes, goal + assist against atalanta, goal and assist against pachuca. Something changed during the middle of december and he hasn't been the same since, but saying the balon dor caused this decline is just not true. He really was on track to do 10x more if things didn't change",

I have been looking into tickets but I'm a bit confused by their website and the process of purchasing. I am wondering if anyone here has purchased tickets through their official website or through a second part vendor and how that process went.\n\nWhen I look at the website, the game is red (as are all of them except for the one coming up on the 30th). Some of those games, when you click into the game to purchase hospitality/VIP tickets have some available but many have none available. I emailed their help and was told tickets would come available but no indication of what kind and when.\n\nBasically just looking for guidance from someone that has purchased tickets for a match on the best way to make sure I get some and don't miss out!\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n",
