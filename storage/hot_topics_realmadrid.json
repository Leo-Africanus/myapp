But I always keep seeing comments like \"Cama should take Arda's place, him and Bellingham are creative players too! We don't need Arda for *just* creativity.\" but that's simply not true.\n\nIf you look at the key passes and chances created stats, it is not even close and I wanted to share that.  \nArda already has the same amount of key passes as Camavinga or Tchouameni last season or for big chances, he even matched Bellingham's last season LaLiga performance which is crazy to do this early.  \n  \nThis boy has been a fresh breath of air and made a big shift in our team. And thanks to Dean Huijsen's addition + Xabi's new system and coaching, we can better direct plays, create LOTS OF MORE chances and overall we just play better. Unless someone more creative comes, I don't see Arda being dropped for anyone in the current squad. He is the key glue of our team in terms of connecting the midfield to attack right now.\n\nI also feel like Bellingham and Arda will compliment each other really well and play together. Even though it wasn't good the last match we did that, I think that was just Bellingham coming out of injury a bit early and not being in form.",

        "title": "Comparing the reaction from this Atletico loss to the one from 2 years ago shows how reactionary you guys are when we lose.",
        "content": "Our current season has been incredibly similar to the 23/24 one, we had won every single game, until matchday 6, where we played Atletico, and we lost 3-1 mostly due to headers and Alaba dropping a stinker, and our only goal being a Kroos banger, which sounds very similar to this game, where Huijsen (A lot of people seem to forget that he absolutely should've won the ball on the 2-2 goal) and Carreras dropped a stinker. And as you guys remember, that ended up being our only loss for that entire fucking league campaign, and we went on to win the CL aswell.\n\n\n\nAs you can read in the post match threads, both in [our sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/realmadrid/comments/16r8p8n/post_match_thread_atl_madrid_vs_real_madrid/?sort=top) and on the [soccer](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/16r8o1k/post_match_thread_atletico_madrid_31_real_madrid) sub reddit, the reactions in that season are incredibly similar to what it is right now. And the ''complaints'' that a lot of people had in the 23/24 season are very similar to what we complain about now aswell. Back then, it was about how we didn't sign a Benzema replacement, and now it's how we didn't sign a Kroos replacement.\n\n Let me tell you a few reactions in the post match threads from both the game from 2 years ago and the game from last week:\n\n1: **''If a vulgar team like Atletico can make us look like clowns, I can\u2019t imagine what it will be like once we face the giants of Europe. We are a significantly worst team than the last two years.''**\n\n2: **''it's gonna be a long painful season, buckle up boys''**\n\n\n3: **''This Real team is pretty damn average. Another la liga to Barca.''**\n\n4: **''Three headers scored. Hard to imagine future opponents not pinging crosses in after that defensive performance.''**\n\n5: **''What a fucking embarrassment. Did we win a single aerial ball??? What a joke.''**\n\n6: **''We lost every aerial duel when they crossed, we had no ideas against their bus parking, every of their through balls got through and defense was way to slow to stop them and our mentality was literally not existent. Our defense lost this game.''**\n\n7: **''We need to trade Vini and rodrygo for Haaland.''**\n\n8: **''First big game of the season and Real Madrid already exposed.''**\n\n9: **''Well, guess thats another La Liga we're handing to Barca, again, see you next season''**\n\n10: **''We're so shit and I'm glad we're getting exposed for it. This team needs some serious re-thinking and re-grouping. I bet my left kidney we won't make it out the RO16.''**\n\nI challenge anyone to pinpoint which of these comments are about the 23/24 game, and which is about the game from last week. You wont be able to, which is the entire point. I could include all of the insane comments about ''XabiOut'' and how we need to sell Valverde and 6 other players, but you already know them and you get the idea, now. Thats not to say the honest criticisms toward Xabi or the players are invalid, they are valid, 100%. Its just how you guys will turn up the temperature from ''This player needs to to better here'' into ''The league is lost, sell this player and sack the manager'' at the first chance you get. Seriously, now that we've gotten a big win in the CL and we've been able to cool down since the Atletico game, go back into the match thread and see read some of the comments that are being posted and upvoted as the game is going, its fucking lunacy.\n\nYou guys had the exact same bombastic reactions to the loss in 23/24, which ended up being the best league campaign since the 11/12 season.\n\nThe same fans that post stuff like the ''1% chance, 99% faith'' things, about how we never give up as Madridistas, are now the same people that go ''League is lost, lets sell 5 players in the winter window and #XabiOut''.\n\nLike, yes, it sucks hard that we lost, especially with 5 goals conceded against a disgusting nazi club, but you guys are reacting as if half of our players fucking died or something.\n\nXabi got the starting XI wrong, and definitely got the subs wrong too, Jude shouldn't have started, he needs more gametime to get back into it after this long injury, starting against Atleti wasn't a good idea, and i feel like Huijsen should do better on the 2-2 goal, and Arda's high kick was stupid. I think if Arda stays, we score 1 more goal and the momentum could've shifted in our favour. Way too many dumbass fouls this game, 1 of which resulted in the free kick goal.\n\nBut holy fuck, will you guys calm down? No, we dont need to sell Fede/Cama/Vini or whoever the fuck you dipshits are calling for to be sold. And no, Xabi doesn't deserve to be sacked.\n\nAlso, stop calling for Rodrygo to start over Vini, this player will continue to do nothing, like he has in the 9 months in the league without a goal or assist.\n\nMy general point is:\n\n#Please calm the fuck down, you guys had the exact same reaction 2 years ago and that season ended up being one of the most succesful league campaigns in Madrid history, and the 15th CL to go along with it.",

        "content": "Some legends are born, some are made, and some survive everything history throws at them. Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s was all three.\n\n\n\nIn the 1950s, he was the star of Hungary\u2019s Mighty Magyars, the team that changed football forever. Short, stocky, and left-footed, Pusk\u00e1s wasn\u2019t built like a classic athlete. But when the ball came to that left foot, it was magic \u2014 thunderous strikes, precise passes, goals from impossible angles. Hungary went unbeaten for four years, humiliated England at Wembley in 1953, and reached the World Cup final in 1954. Pusk\u00e1s was the heartbeat of it all.\n\nBut then came politics and tragedy. The Hungarian Uprising of 1956 forced him into exile. He was branded a traitor, banned from football for two years, and at 31, many thought his career was finished. Overweight, aging, and with no club, it looked like the world had seen the last of Pusk\u00e1s.\n\nAnd then came Madrid. Real Madrid took a gamble, and what followed was one of the greatest second acts in football history. Slimmed down and reborn, Pusk\u00e1s formed a devastating partnership with Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano. Together they turned Madrid into the ultimate powerhouse of European football. Pusk\u00e1s scored goals for fun \u2014 hat-tricks, four in a European Cup final, even a famous five-goal haul in a Cl\u00e1sico against Barcelona.\n\nIn total, he scored 242 goals in 262 games for Real Madrid \u2014 numbers so outrageous they barely seem real. He won 3 European Cups, 5 league titles, and a Pichichi trophy four times. For a man who was supposed to be finished, it was pure redemption.\n\nWhat made Pusk\u00e1s beloved wasn\u2019t just the goals, though. It was his humanity. He was humble, warm, a joker in the dressing room. Fans called him \u201cPancho,\u201d and in Madrid he wasn\u2019t seen as a foreigner but as family.\n\nWhen he finally retired, he left behind not just records but a legacy of resilience. He had been a golden boy in Hungary, an outcast in exile, and then a reborn legend in Spain. Today, FIFA\u2019s award for the best goal of the year carries his name \u2014 the Pusk\u00e1s Award \u2014 a fitting tribute to the man whose left foot was poetry.\n\nFerenc Pusk\u00e1s wasn\u2019t just a footballer. He was proof that genius can\u2019t be broken by politics, age, or exile. For many, he will always be remembered as the exiled genius who conquered Madrid and the world.",

        "title": "Mbappe has become too good and some of our players are lost or unable to keep up",
        "content": "Hi guys, just want to share what I have in mind. Mbappe form is excellent right now, he is much more clinical and confident in finishing, even in penalty now it is much harder to read where he aim to shoot. This is what I want from striker. The opposing team has fear where he's at and has to keep an eye on him, with or without ball. some legendary striker like R9, CR7, and so on also has this. But unfortunately, some of our players got this idea of 'Just give him a good ball and he will score' While this is really good we can't have the whole team think like this. Arda Guler does a great job finding him and at the same time find the space and position to score a goal himself. Our player should take advantage that more than 1 defender try to defend Mbappe and find the space to shoot or create chances, but sadly from the several games so far under Xabi, for example Vini does not take advantage of the space to create havoc. I guess I would say this is the same problem with Jude and Fede but Jude just came back from Injury so might be that. I hope Fede realized this and try to shoot more like in the past. I have high hopes for Franco (as well as Brahim) as he seems to understand about this like Arda. If one day Mbappe can't play I'm not sure if we have a backup plan if we didn't find solution to this. Thoughts?",

        "content": "The obvious answer for me and many was always Franco, but now that i think about it I'm not so sure.   \nMaybe things change when Trent is back, but right now our right side without Franco is dead.  \nWe could see it in game vs atletico, most attacks went throught the left and we became very predictable, our only goals came from brilliant pass from Arda and then multiple Atleti defenders fucking up before that 2nd goal. Maybe Jude provides something that we've been missing but we cant rely on Arda to Kylian through balls and Vini/Rodrygo dribbling 3 players as our only ways of scoring.  \nI was thinking maybe 4-3-3 with Jude-Arda-Tchouameni in midfield but then again i love Fede so it would suck dropping him and i dont even know if that midfield would work against better teams like PSG or Barca.  \nOnce trent comes back we could try to play 3-5-2, assuming he can play as a wingback.  \nWhat do you guys think? Do we drop Franco and try to power through the left or do we drop one of our midfielders.",

Now imagine both of them operating together \u2014 their technical skill, intensity, and mentality would complement each other perfectly.\n\nNot only do they balance out stylistically (Arda\u2019s a lefty, Jude\u2019s a righty), but Jude also adds that little bit of aerial threat that Arda doesn\u2019t. The chemistry potential is massive.\n\nI don\u2019t know what Xabi has in mind tactically, but honestly, I\u2019d love to see us run with two CAMs behind a front line of Vini/Rodrygo and Mbapp\u00e9 up top. The creativity and movement would be insane, and it plays to our current squad\u2019s biggest strengths instead of forcing square pegs into round holes.\n\nIf we\u2019re serious about the future, it starts with giving these two the keys to the midfield.\n\nWhat is your opinion on this?",
