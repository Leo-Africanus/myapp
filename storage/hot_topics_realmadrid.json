        "content": "&gt; Lunin can leave Real Madrid this summer. The 26-year-old Ukrainian goal has a contract with the white team until 2030, but he has a secondary role and everything indicates that he will remain the same with the renewal of Courtois for two more seasons.\n\n&gt; Faced with this situation, Lunin is rethinking his future at Real Madrid. He has offers to leave the Bernab\u00e9u and has made them known to the white leaders. Some offers that will surely increase as the opening of the summer transfer market approaches.\n &gt; Lunin has lived some somewhat special seasons at Real Madrid. The previous one, took the white team to the final in London, but he did not play it, but the goalkeeper of the final was Courtois. The same has happened in the current one with the Copa del Rey. Lunin has played the entire tournament, but the Sevilla final was played by Courtois. Some situations that have caused Lunin to be thinking about leaving the white club.\n\n&gt; Coincidence or not, names of goalkeepers have already begun to emerge to reach Real Madrid next summer. Kepa can return to the Bernab\u00e9u if Lunin leaves, while Joan Garc\u00eda's name begins to sound very strong in Valdebebas.",

        "title": "Top 10 Real Madrid Players of All Time",
        "content": "So I was having a discussion with my friend and we both were wondering who we wuld consider in the list of top 10 real madrid players of all time. So many legends have played for our club and given their all so it wuld be hard to come up with just 10 players but I still tried my best trying to include all the factors like trophies and performance.\n\n**1) Cristiano Ronaldo:** Madafaqa scored 450 goals and 120 assists in just 438 games for us so Ig that's enough to put him at the first place. He also gave us 4 ballon d'or worthy season in just the 9 seasons he spent at our club and is also our top scorer and third highester assist provider.\n\n**2) Alfredo Di Stefano:** He was the main man (alongside puskas) in our 5-peat in the european cup and defined our 1950s era and global identity. Without him the club would no be close to what it is right now.\n\n**3) Raul Gonzalez:** He is our third all time top scorer and has won 3x champions league and 6x la liga. He spent 16 years of his career playing for Real Madrid, becoming the holder for most appearances with the club (741). He has always been a madridsta in his heart and a lifelong leader\n\n**4) Sergio Ramos:** He is without doubt a top 10 player but I am not sure how much the rest of you wuld agree with his position being this high. For me tho he definitely deserves this spot. One of the much clutch players in our history (Scoring that 92:48 equalizer vs atletico or the only goal in 1-1 win after a penalty shootout in the ucl final 2016). Even without his defensive skills, he scored 101 goals for us while being a freaking defender. More that enough to be at the 4th spot for me.\n\n**5) Kareem Benzema:** 2nd Highest Scorer and 2nd Highest Assist provider, benzema was one of the most selfless player who despite being a striker wuld try to provide chances for ronaldo. However, our longtime unsung hero finally turned into a leader and Ballon d\u2019Or winner (2022).\n\n**6) Zinedine Zidane:** As a player you could argue zidane doesn't deserve to be this high but when you couple his managerial career he is undoubtedly one of the greatest football maestros to have worked under this club. 3 UCLs and 2 La Ligas in just 4 seasons including a historic three-peat xD plus that iconic ucl final goal.\n\n**7)** **Luka Modric**: A faithful servant of the club who won 6 champions league with us and is till going strong at 39\n\n**8) Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s:** He was a goalscoring machine who scored 242 goals in 262 games winning 3x european cup and 5x la liga titles. He had immense influence alongside di stefano\n\n**9) Roberto Carlos:** He scored 69 Goals and 116 Assists in 527 Apperances for us as a left back. He revolutionized the full back role\n\n**10) Marcelo:** He came to fill the role of roberto carlos and oh boy he did it perfectly. Over 100 Assists for us including so many legendary crosses like bale's goal in the ucl final. In the ucl 2017-18 campaign he also scored 3 goals in the knockout stages plus 2 assists in the final. 5x La Liga and 6x Champions League, he definitely deserves this spot for me\n\nSome Honourable Mentions: Paco Gento, Iker Casillas, Toni Kroos, Casemiro, Keylor Navas etc\n\nI would love to see some of our new players like bellingham, valverde, mbappe and vini to crack this list too by the end of their career but they would have to achieve a lot",

        "content": "Since there's talks about the club making moves to sell Rodrygo this summer, I felt it was apt to share their stats this year with the madridistas. It is to be noted that Rodrygo has a total of **1937 mins** in appearance for the club and Vini Jr has **2046 mins**. Both have the same number of games started, 22 games.\n\nI'll link the source here for [Vini Jr](https://footystats.org/players/brazil/vinicius-junior) and [Rodrygo](https://footystats.org/players/brazil/rodrygo).   \n  \nWould it make sense to give Rodrygo one more season under a new manager, even if a strong offer comes in this summer? Considering he'll be competing for the wide or forward roles with both Vini Jr. and Mbapp\u00e9, isn\u2019t there a risk that his potential could go to waste if he\u2019s not a guaranteed starter? Especially if the team continues with a narrow 4-4-2 formation? Let's be real the 4-3-3 system with all three forwards starting wasn't a success in any sense as we'd thought it'd be before the season started.",

Yes, he\u2019s incredibly talented and mature for his age, but Mbappe at 17 was already breaking through with Monaco, not a varca. He scored 28 goals and made 16 assists in just 46 games. That\u2019s nearly double Yamal\u2019s goals in less than half the matches. And this wasn\u2019t in a team built around youth development and possession,this was Ligue 1 football. So while Yamal is special, acting like he\u2019s the first of his kind ignores just how elite Mbappe already was back then.",

        "title": "Rodrygo Goes or does he not?",
        "content": "It infuriates me as to how we are just fine with letting Rodrygo leave Real Madrid. We're talking about the man who kisses the badge every fucking time he scores. Do you guys remember when Vini and Rodrygo joined the club? Do you also remember how Vini used to misplace passes, fail dribbles, use flashy skills with 100% fail rate, finish 0/n chances when he was new? At the same time Rodrygo was scoring freekicks against Bayern, a PERFECT hattrick in the UCL at the age of what 18? and was way more promising. He was definitely a better player than Vini and the consequence of being a better footballer than Vini was that his weak foot was much better than Vini's weak foot. After Mariano D\u00edaz and Hazard, when both Vini and Rodrygo had to be accommodated with Benzema, Rodrygo shifted to the right just because he had a better weak foot than Vini. This MAJOR SACRIFICE has led to every single thing now, be it Vini's Ballon D'or shouts, or even being considered Madrid's best. Just think about it, had Vini been playing RW and Rodrygo at LW, y'all would've whistled so hard that Vini would've been the next Vallejo or would've been sold whereas Rodrygo would've been our main man and would've got the ballon d'or shouts (he also has a way better PR). The development that Vini got in these 5 years has been exponentially more than Rodrygo because Rodrygo has been so limited by his position, he's as good as any other professional footballer just starting out when he has to score with his left. This affects his numbers too and obviously confidence. When he leaves and starts playing as a LW, he'll easily become their club legend and retire with much more attention he's been getting now. Just remember, things would've been so different if Rodrygo had stayed stubborn instead of helping the team in anyway possible. No one is CR7 who can contribute everywhere from upfront. This season Rodrygo has been playing better with Mbappe than Vini. Y'all need to remember that if we have one CR7 then we need one Benzema. Rodrygo is the only one of the three upfront who can be Benzema. Either way, we still need him for depth or if one of Vini/Mbappe are suspended or injured. He can be a great sub although I'd much rather see him retire as one of football's best for which he'll have to leave.",

I would probably lose the start of the tennis match. What do you think?\nThanks",

        "title": "Will Xabi\u2019s 3-4-2-1 actually work for us next season?",
        "content": "With Xabi Alonso likely coming in, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about how we\u2019d actually line up under him. His go-to has been a 3-4-2-1, though lately he\u2019s used a 4-4-1-1 too. But if it\u2019s 3-4-2-1, I don\u2019t know if it suits our squad right now.\n\nVini fits well as the LAM, but Jude on the right \u2014 especially if Rodrygo leaves \u2014 doesn\u2019t seem natural. Mbapp\u00e9 as the 9 in this setup might be a problem too. It\u2019s just not the type of system that plays to his strengths.\n\nMidfield might be our strongest point. Valverde in that Xhaka-like role with Camavinga beside him sounds solid. If we get TAA, he\u2019s a dream fit for RWB. LWB is still a big question mark though \u2014 we don\u2019t really have a proper player for that.\n\nOur biggest issue though is depth in defence. Alaba is done at this level, let\u2019s be honest. Milit\u00e3o\u2019s had two ACL tears in two years (2023 and 2024), so relying on him is risky. R\u00fcdiger leaving is being talked about too \u2014 and that would leave us in a really bad spot.\n\nJoan Mart\u00ednez is still recovering, but there haven\u2019t been many updates on his situation. Right now, we seriously need to sign two proper centre-backs. Someone like Saliba or Dean Huijsen would be ideal \u2014 I know we probably can\u2019t get both, but one of them plus another solid CB is a must.\n\nAnd about G\u00fcler \u2014 we need to be more patient and give him more chances in attacking roles. His quality in finishing and positioning is too valuable to keep using him in deeper roles. With time and trust, he can grow into a real asset further up the pitch.\n\nLooking at everything, I think we\u2019re more likely to go with a 3-5-2 or 4-4-1-1 than stick to a full 3-4-2-1.",
