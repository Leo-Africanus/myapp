The media praised him, and every fan base wanted him on their team. The football world loved the wonder kid and praised his leadership. The following season he joins the biggest club in the world and continues to solidify himself as a superstar. Now people disrespect his footballing abilities and question his character. Funny how quick people change their minds. \n",

This operation would not turn Real Madrid into a Public Limited Sports Company (SAD); instead, a parallel corporate structure would be created to accommodate the investor\u2019s stake.\n\nFlorentino\u2019s goal is to bring in external capital, strengthening Real Madrid\u2019s competitiveness against \u201cstate-backed clubs\u201d such as Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain. Even with the investor\u2019s arrival, the remaining 90\u201395% of the shares would stay in the hands of the current members. However, these member shares would no longer be freely transferable to outside individuals, being restricted to circulation only among club members.\n\nNevertheless, for the proposal to move forward, a referendum among the members is required, along with an extraordinary assembly in which the plan would be formally presented and explained.\n",

        "content": "We're in mid November and we have won every single one of our home games in all competitions (6 in La Liga, 2 in the UCL). With the amount of negativity after our recent games, nobody even talks about how good we've been in general under Xabi.\n\nThe last time we did something similar was back in... 2011/12 season, under Mourinho. For context, Nacho had only played a couple of games for RM back then. We still had 9 UCLs, Ronaldo had 1 Ballon d'Or and Mastantuono was 4 years old. Legendary managers like Zidane or Ancelotti have never managed to win all their home games early in the season.\n\nThe 11/12 run stopped in December 10th, when we lost the Clasico at home. Considering we have 4 away games in a row, if we win against Celta and Man City in December, we can do even better.\n\nIdk about you, but I'm pretty positive about this season and Xabi in general. We're already much better in \"smaller\" games than we used to be in recent years, and that's where we usually struggled and dropped points in La Liga. Slowly we'll improve in bigger games too, we already won against Barcelona after 4 defeats in a row.\n\nHala Madrid!",

The unnecessary and inglorious ending of the match has left David Jim\u00e9nez suspended for this match, the captain Manuel \u00c1ngel for 3 matches, and Arbeloa for two matches, meaning his assistant, Juli\u00e1n Carmona is on the sidelines today and next week. Additionally, the team has to compensate for the injuries of Fortea, Fettal, de Llanos and Roberto Mart\u00edn, while Fran Gonz\u00e1lez is with Spain U21\n\n27' - heavy elbow into the Cacere\u00f1o player's face by \u00c1lvaro Leiva, I'm surprised their coach is not asking for a review since their player was treated for a significant nose bleed for a couple of minutes, but he can continue \n\n45'+1 - Mesonero with a free kick near the edge of the box, but from a very tight angle - his cross is hit hard, but gets slightly deflected, and ends up hitting the post, biggest chance for Castilla so far \n\nHT - Castilla are dominating possession without generating much danger in a half that was fully conditioned by the heavy rain and the drenched pitch - if the rain doesn't stop, the conditions won't get better, so this match will be a literal fight in the mud won by whichever team wants it the most \n\n\ud83d\udd04 46' - second half is underway, Diego Aguado comes off after his early yellow card, Cristian David on the pitch now\n\n58' - spectacular dribble by Manu Serrano, who nutmegs his opponent and enters the box - he lays it off to Palacios, whose shot is too central and their keeper can save it \n\n\ud83d\udd04 61' - Loren and Pitarch off, \u00c1lvaro Gin\u00e9s and Bruno on\n\n63' - triple chance for Castilla - Bruno Iglesias' gets put through in the box, but his quick shot is saved by the keeper - the ball drops for Mesonero, who is tackled as he shoots and can't direct the ball goalwards, but instead to \u00c1lvaro Gin\u00e9s, who shoots from a short distance but it gets blocked \n\n65' - Mesonero's shot from the edge of the box is saved by the keeper once more. The goal needs to come quickly now, the Castilla dominance is overwhelming\n\n\ud83d\udd04 70' - Arbeloa and his proxy Juli\u00e1n Carmona use up all their subs early on, Y\u00e1\u00f1ez and Pol Fortuny on for Leiva and Mesonero\n\n74' - Bruno Iglesias with a Kroos-like shot from deep, and it hits the post again... Bad luck at this point for Castilla \n\n\u26bd 78' - GOLLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - Finally! The ball is played out to the left wing, where Bruno puts in a nice cross towards the far post. Cacere\u00f1o make an error in the marking, and \u00c1lvaro Gin\u00e9s is completely open at the far post to head it into the net from a short distance - he crowns his official debut for Castilla with a goal! \n\n82' - penalty for Castilla! Y\u00e1\u00f1ez is brought down at the edge of the box during a counter attack\n\n\u26bd 85' - GOLLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - after a review to see whether the foul was really on the line or just outside, the penalty is given - Palacios steps up and sends the keeper the wrong way, hopefully sealing a very deserved victory! \n\nFT - despite the absence of various players and Arbeloa himself, Castilla manage their potentially best performance of the season in the second half - after struggling more with the waterlogged pitch then the opponent in the first half, the team dominated even more after the rain finally stopped, creating a variety of opportunities, hitting the post twice and finally scoring two goals for a very deserved win. All the players who had to step in today like Mesonero, Bruno, Leiva and \u00c1lvaro Gin\u00e9s contributed nicely, making the absentee list hardly felt on the pitch.

        "content": "Do you think Florentino P\u00e9rez has surpassed Santiago Bernabe\u00fa as the most important president in the history of this institution? If you include everything, not just men's football, but like the basketball team and the creation of a women's team, I think he has done a lot for the club. The Bernabe\u00fa has been upgraded under his tenure, he's brought in Gal\u00e1cticos and won a lot of UCL trophies, in both his 1st and 2nd stint. Fans would always say, you can't replace Cristiano, or Kroos, or Modric, or Ramos, or Zidane, etc. but I think P\u00e9rez is probably going to be the one person we'll miss the most. We literally had to wait decades to go from Bernabe\u00fa to P\u00e9rez, I wonder how long until the next great Real Madrid president shows up.",

        "title": "I rewatched Liverpool vs Real Madrid and I think we overreacted a bit \ud83d\ude2c",
        "content": "\nAfter rewatching the match, a few things stood out:\n\n1. It wasn\u2019t as bad as it first seemed.\nThe first half showed promising rotations and chance creation, but the final pass and finishing were missing. The players are still adapting to a system that requires composure on the ball, something easier to execute in La Liga than against high-intensity teams like Liverpool. We did manage to bypass their midfield often, but the end product wasn\u2019t there.\n\n\n2. Old habits are hard to break.\nThis team is used to transition football, so shifting to a possession-oriented style will take time. Vini, for example, still looks to attack immediately rather than recycle play when needed. We need more patience instead of forcing every forward move into a chance.\n\n\n3. Arda G\u00fcler needs experience.\nHe had a decent first half despite small mistakes, but looked lost when shifted left after the break. I\u2019d chalk that up to inexperience rather than pressure. While many fans see him as a No. 10, I still believe he\u2019s better suited to developing into a deep-lying playmaker.\n\n\n4. Xabi experimented heavily in the second half.\nThe tactical tweaks didn\u2019t come off because the players didn\u2019t seem fully prepared for them. G\u00fcler looked uncertain, Rodrygo didn\u2019t seem to know his role, and the defensive rotations (Fede dropping in, later Tchouameni) caused confusion rather than control. Xabi\u2019s adjustments tried to solve one issue but created another, something normal early in a new coach\u2019s cycle. The team simply needs more time to absorb his ideas.\n\n\n\nOverall:\nThe loss to Liverpool is just a small setback in a long-term project. What matters most is that Xabi keeps the dressing room. Despite negative leaks, I believe, he can still succeed. If he does, Real could dominate for another decade.\n\nHala Madrid.\n\n(Will add more thoughts after watching the Rayo Vallecano match.)",

        "content": "I was watching the game last night (as a neutral but hoping Madrid would win for something different, also Bar\u00e7a have annoying fans) and unlike last season where Madrid got a historic 3\u20131 away win over Bar\u00e7a, this season it returned to usual with a 4\u20130 away defeat for Las Blancas (the same as the 4\u20130 loss at home last season).\n\nYes Bar\u00e7a have a better squad and Madrid need to start caring about their women's team a lot more, but the squad difference isn't big enough to be bent over every single time. Last season there were five El Cl\u00e1sicos: Bar\u00e7a won 4\u20130, 5\u20130 (twice) and 3\u20131 then Madrid won 3\u20131.\n\nBar\u00e7a lost 1\u20130 to Sociedad this season and 2\u20131 to Levante last season, so they are beatable, plus they only have 17 players due to their financial problems. It's almost like Madrid have been given their best present and chance at silverware but yet they keep proving they can't do it.\n\nDo your players just not play for the badge or what?",
