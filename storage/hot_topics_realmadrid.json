No one can deny what he\u2019s done for Real Madrid financially, institutionally, and globally. But past success doesn\u2019t guarantee present competence. Leadership at this level requires constant sharpness, independence, and the ability to say \u201cno\u201d even to powerful players and stakeholders.\n\nSo the uncomfortable question is: Has P\u00e9rez become too old for the role?\nAnd if so, is it time for him to step aside for someone who can reassert control and modernize the sporting structure of the club?\n\nI\u2019m not pushing an agenda, I\u2019m just genuinely curious what other Madridistas think.",

        "content": "First of all, I'm not saying this to \"hate\" on the kid. I think he is a talented youngster and he has the potential to be a great player. He had some good performances earlier in the season as well.\n\nThe problem is that his skillset isn't suitable for the RW position. He doesn't have the extreme pace and 1v1 dribbling required to be a touchline winger like Vini and he certainly doesn't have the shooting boots to be your typical inverted winger. He is yet another creative attacking midfielder, yet another player in our squad who can, on paper, play RW, but he isn't an actual RW (like Rodrygo, Arda, Endrick, Valverde etc). \n\nHis best position is AM, a position covered by a 22 year and a 20 year old. And soon, maybe buy another 21 year old, who happens to be a top 3 player in Serie A. There's a huge debate in our fanbase if two of them can co-exist in the same line-up, so all four of them being in the same squad makes no sense imo.\n\nTo make the analogy, our current squad compared to 16/17 feels like having no Kroos/Modric, 2 Casemiros, 2-3 Kovacics and 3-4 Iscos (in terms of style, not quality). \n\nThe club knew that Jude was still gonna play games as an AM, that Arda will develop and that Nico Paz had a great season and he might return sooner or later, so I struggle to see how buying Mastantuono for 50m suits our squad, even long-term?\n\n* Either our scouting department sucks and they assumed Franco actually has RW qualities and they never saw him play\n* OR our board sucks and we just bought yet another expensive South American teenager, just to block other teams from buying him (why didn't we buy Estevao then? Much more suitable to our squad).\n\nIn any case: good prospect, bad transfer, in terms of useability to our squad.\n\nAgain, I'm NOT saying Franco is a bad player or that he doesn't have the potential to be amazing in the future. I just don't see the point of buying our... 4th U-22 AM for 50m when we desperately need defenders and a deep lying playmaker. It seems like some of our transfers just happen, without any sort of planning. No team has succeeded with 3 LWs, 4 AMs and 5 physical midfielders.",

I'm also going to add some thing like how that red card was the main highlight of that wc and not him playing so good throughout the group stage and knockout and how young generation of france doubted his legacy and all then i'm also going to add how he had a great manager career.

I can understand the frustration, but it seems like they only started watching soccer yesterday. The first round of the Copa del Rey is like that, and it's the game of a lifetime for smaller clubs. We shouldn't overreact. Real Madrid has a lot of work to do, yes, but they're not going to sell the whole team because they conceded two goals in the round of 32 of the Copa del Rey, thanks Lunin por saving us, there is a great gap to be improved. \n\n",

        "content": "This post may age horribly, but: academy product + minimal complaints + fiery, aggressive attitude on the pitch when called upon + can play multiple positions in the backline = reminds me of Nacho.\n\nLike Nacho, Ascensio isn't the greatest CB, and can presumably make only an OK L/R back in an emergency, but he seems to have the fighting spirit and pace that made Nacho able to come in and do a job when needed. Of course, Nacho eventually gained enough experience to become a very fine CB, but that was after a decade learning from the best.\n\nNacho is a horribly underrated player for RM, but players like him who are able to patiently wait and them come in across the backline are generally undervalued in the football world.",
