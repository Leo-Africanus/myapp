He has been key for us, as far back as the 2019/20 LL run-in where he was excellent. He has been a vital defender in 2 UCL wins. He has locked down world class wingers in big UCL nights, he saved us with inches to spare vs Man City.\n\nPeople who have a flashy toy/\u201cmodern fullback\u201d obsession always wanted Mendy out, even when he was solid for us. Other teams have more modern fullbacks, but we (and Mendy, by extension) have the titles. I\u2019ve seen someone ask for Marc Cucurella for God\u2019s sake!\n\nI hope this is Mendy\u2019s last season and I think it will be but it should\u2019t be used to rewrite his entire 6 years at the club.

But for some reason, I keep seeing people shit on Vini online, and everyone in the comments is agreeing with them for some reason. \n\nIt gets to a point where I think it's just out of racism and not disliking a player because you just don't like them. I don't like I don't like Phil Foden because I find him kind of annoying, but you don't see me going on hate tangents for it or quoting him just to mock him for what he said. \n\nI also guarantee most people saying this are under 18 because adults who talk like this are the same to watch a cunt like Asmondgold. It's similar to hate players like Rashford or Saka get just for being black. But there are things you could give Vini criticism for it's just that they don't. It's like they get off making fun of or mocking ",

        "title": "About Tchouameni, either this sub doesn't watch games or many can only remember up to one game",
        "content": "So I'm reading in posts and comments : \"One bad game and those \\*\\*\\*\\* turned on Tchouameni\" and \"F Bernabeu for whistling Tchouameni, he shut them up and you can't blame him for playing a position that isn't his\"\n\nDid any of these watch the actual games ? This season, I remember Bellingham and Rudiger having 2 or 3 bad games.. Tchouameni ? The opposite. And a funny fact, yesterday was his best and maybe only good performance as a CDM !\n\nThe few couple of games he had and was good he was actually a CB ! This is the same shit as Mbapp\u00e9 in his bad games, getting a pass with his horrible performance, horrible touch, weak shooting, zero spatial awareness, just because he is not a number 9.\n\nIt's a fact that Tchouameni has been below average overall this season and on top of my mind, yesterday's game and Girona were his only 'Great' performances. Feel free to share ratings, as maybe I'm the one missing something and he has actually been consistent as a CDM but only sucked as CB..\n\nI remember seeing his stiffness in Bilbao and questioning why the hell has he started this game. In many other games, he is just kind of there... Bernabeu clearly had enough.. it's the most demanding fans and even CR7 got whistled, Benzema got whistled. I don't trash or shit on a player for playing 3 or 4 bad games... but Tchouameni's form and performance has been very questionable and what makes it worse is that he is starting ahead of a player who is showing promise and loved by the fans, Asencio.\n\nTchouameni was MOTM yesterday together with Endrick, good for him and for the team. What we want is consistency.\n\nBut Tchouameni was no prime Casemiro or Xabi Alonso until the Clasico.. he was, together with Vazquez, our main holes in defense and except for yesterday, he has been our worst player in the midfield that even Ceballos who many fans ( including me last season ) wanted him sold/replaced, is playing well and better than him.\n\nEDIT: this kind of thinking is the same one that got Vazquez to start against Bar\u00e7a.. it's because he did well against Pachuca and some other La Liga average teams.. so yes coaches decided he is CAFU and he is now a good RB.",
