        "content": "Can't wait till Rudiger and Alaba finally leave, so we get 36 million euros salary freed up. And we can bring in some quality depth to the defense and never see Tchouameni playing down there ever again. Xabi deserved to get to that second season and fulfill his vision, but the injury situation has been horrible and the players haven't helped either.\n\nThe dream now would be to see a short term deal with Zidane coming in and just doing his magic. It would be good for him to familiarize hands on with the french players and also get back to coaching after half a decade away. And if he wants to coach the french team once Deschamps leaves, he should have a gentleman agreement to allow that. And Zidane is only 53 with the opportunity to sign some top defenders next season, so maybe he decides to stay. He's been in the scene quite a bit recently attending the NFL game at the Bernab\u00e9u and greeting Florentino P\u00e9rez, so idk. The only manager better than Alonso is Zizou, so why sack if you have none better, unless Zizou is a possibility.\n\nAnd Arbeloa should keep coaching the Castilla side and is wasted being the Madrid coach because he doesn't have the reputation which has a big influence in terms of managing players. And Castilla is looking good with him there which is what we want with our youth products and promotion isn't a far reach compared to previous seasons. Hopefully the situation is resolved quick.",

        "title": "We went from winning a brace 1.5 year ago... to a nightmare.",
        "content": "I wanted to share my analysis, or rather... state the obvious.\n\nWeren't we celebrating a brace the summer before the last one? A season where Bellingham and Vinicius blossomed and we had a season where we:\n\n* Defeated Bar\u00e7a in all Clasicos ( the least of our achievements )\n* Won la Liga with only one loss ( because of an individual disaster class of defending from Alaba )\n* Won the CL with yet crazy games against Bayern Munich and Man City notably?\n\nRemember that this season happened after Benzema left, our central forward since 2009 ( been rotating with Higuain, but been our consistent CF since 2013-2014 )\n\nThen\u2014\n\nThree key players left. Two key players in RM for the last... fucking decade:\n\n* Kroos, our consistent midfield for a decade. I don't need to say more about Kroos.\n* Nacho, who always filled any position whenever one of our starting defenders was out. Man can play LB, RB and CB, and is always a beast in big games, with a leader and captain mentality\n\nAnd the third key player is our golden loanee Joselu, who sent us to the CL final and had a beautiful season, showing how far a classic tall and bully number 9 can take you.\n\nSomehow... somehow... ( I can't believe it till this day ), Perez thought these three leaving is nothing to worry about. Guess who he brings?\n\n* Mbapp\u00e9 ( LW )\n* Endrick ( Brazilian teenager who we ended up loaning. to Lyon ).\n\nThat's it.\n\nCarvajal tears his ACL? The board? Doesn't buy a replacement. Doesn't even loan a RB in the winter market, despite LV proving he is just bad in that position.\n\nMilitao tears his ACL a second time? The board? Tells Carlo to fuck off and play Tchou as CB. I believe not playing Asencio sooner was a mistake, but Asencio is no Ramos as we all see.\n\nIn half of our games last year, the only defender in our back four is Rudiger, who was sucked dry all the season. Camavinga as LB, LV as RB, Tchou as CB.\n\nAs always, the coach takes the fall in the end of the season and Alonso, who everyone was crying for comes in. And he does a good job for a starting coach in the CWC, playing GG, testing a 3 defenders backline and his Leverkuzen system.\n\nThe season started decently with Hujisen, Carreras playing well, together with Guler Mbapp\u00e9 link up... Until the Clasico.\n\nVini throws that tantrum... I can't defend him on that. No one can. Fuck him for that. It's a shame our 3rd captain is him. Then the nightmare starts, and we go from being ahead by 5 points on Bar\u00e7a... we lose these points like the Clasico never happened... in a little more than one month.\n\nMbapp\u00e9 gesturing with hands at Alonso like he is lecturing some toddler on the pitch? Fuck him for that.\n\nWhat happens? The coach, again, takes the fall. I don't know if he was sacked or resigned, but either way, Perez didn't show any support. It's clear as day. None at all.\n\nI feel so bad for Alonso, who was living the dream in Leverkuzen and thought he could do the same here. He expected soldiers in the locker room, hungry players to dominate... and he ended up with a bunch of Instagram divas.\n\nI won't say it's all of our players, as we saw players publicly standing with Alonso... but whoever didn't, complained about long tactical video sessions, they can fuck off and they deserve all the whistles.\n\nThese players get paid billions to do two things:  \n\\- Win games  \n\\- Listen to the coach instructions\n\nThey did neither, and as usual, Courtois keeps bailing their asses out.\n\nSo to sum it up\u2014Fuck Perez. Everyone has been saying Carlo has been saved by individual brilliance last year?\n\nHow about I tell you it's Perez who has been saved by Zidane and Carlo's miracles, who always found ways, despite the very poor squad management?",
