Modric, kroos, benzema, nacho, carvajal. But Ramos wanted a 2 year contract, Perez said no only one year and gave him a deadline. Ramos then decided to be stubborn until the final day but it was already too late and he had to leave. \n\nI mean it\u2019s honestly really annoying on how so many people don\u2019t know about this, unless this was just false information (in that case I retract everything) but I doubt it.

        "content": "He was criticized heavily for his bad performance in the early season and especially the super cup and I believe it was well deserved criticism, but we have to talk about his form recently, as I believe he has been our best player in the last couple of months. He is bossing the midfield in recent games and today he had a perfect game for me as a DM. He did also good against City as a CB. I believe he can play well in both if he keeps up this form but I prefer having him as a DM.\n\nTchou, or as I call him jokingly, Nonchalalentmeni, deserves appreciation and credits. Let's hope he keeps this form. And let's give a small probs to Carlo as now we know the reason why he kept insisting on him.",
