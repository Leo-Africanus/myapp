The players are clearly not at their best because it's a transition period - there is clear confusion amongst the players as the playstyle of Ancelotti and Xabi is drastically different, and even Man City suffered in the start under Pep Guardiola, and so did Allegri with Juventus. Good things take time and I believe Xabi's the man. Let's hope with Mbappe back we'll be stronger. ",

        "content": "I bought tickets to go to the game with my grandfather. He is a huge fan and had never seen the team play in person and he is 91. I drove to Orlando (3.5h one way) the day before to get him. Bought parking ($50) to be sure I didn\u2019t have to be looking last minute and waste time. \n\nArrived 1.5 hour earlier cause I knew there would be traffic no matter what - and there was. There was no way to ask for information and I would be moving a car length every 3 -4 minutes. I kept looking at the  parking lots for mine and I kept passing by lot 18-17-16-15 and suddenly there was no 14. Still at the same moving rate. I saw someone directing traffic and told me to turn around and it would be on my left. And well when I did the lot was closed as all of the same colored ones were. After moving that slow I found someone else and told me to go to lot 6 which took at least 20 minutes to get there from where I was. The game had already started at that point. My grandfather wasn\u2019t feeling too well either. After I got to lot 6.. it was closed. Parking was full everywhere. I asked the next person I saw and told me to do a U turn and it would be on my right (BS I just came from there and everything was closed) I then decided to find parking on my own in another plaza which were all full and you could see tow trucks left and right. After an extra 10 minute I found parking (free btw). \n\nThe it was a 20 minute walk to the stadium gate under 92 f sun. Finally arrived to the gate the game was in around minute 67. Finally walking in I was told I couldn\u2019t walk in with my small bag (that I had brought and was let in without problems for the Inter Miami - Al Ahly game on Saturday) so they made me lay 18 to put it in a locker room for basically the 20min left of the game. My grandfather wasn\u2019t feeling well and almost fainted, I had to hold him. The heat, the stress, no being able to have water for so long. Someone came to help but he said he doesn\u2019t need help, he\u2019ll brave through it to watch as much time as he could. Until we got to the seats. It was about minute 74. Got there to watch Valverde miss a penalty and at least we watched Modric go in (his favorite player) and hear the stadium chant his name. \n\nBesides that, nightmare and piss job from hard rock stadium. Made me miss the whole game, my grandpa faint and made me pay extra for shit because they felt like it. Oh it also took us 2 hours to get out of the parking because Miami drivers and traffic officers and organizers are ass. That was my experience today. $485 gone to waste with extra unpleasantness. FUCK Hard Rock Stadium. ",

AND he was the first one to beat Barca by 4 goals since 1995.\n\n\n* His team scored 4 goals at Allianz Arena against Pep's Bayern and 5 goals at Anfield against Klopp's Liverpool (Liverpool who we had never beaten in our history before Carlo mind you), you need to go back to 50's and 60's to see Real Madrid achieve such scorelines against best teams in europe. And we had NEVER won at Allianz in our HISTORY when he won 4:0 against Pep there.\n\n\n* Pep Guardiola, our literal worst nightmare, has faced us almost 30 times and only lost 3 matches by 2 or more goals, ALL 3 TIMES it was Carlo's Real Madrid.\n\n\n* Carlo's Real Madrid faced Pep 5 times in the UCL and eliminated him 4 out of those 5 while being considered underdogs in most of those ties which is an insane achievment\n\n\n* We like to pride ourselves with being a team who always comes back, but out of 8 Comebacks that Real Madrid has completed in the UCL era (since 1992) 5 have come under Ancelotti. HE is the comeback king.\n\n\nThere are many many more examples of things that Real Madrid didnt achieve before Carlo and that no other team has achieved but Carlo's Real did.\n\n\nI understand that we lost virtually all important games this season (bar Man City and Atletico) and that he had to go, im also really excited for Xabi's reign which starts today, but to see some fans talk about Carlo like he wasn't an absolute GOAT for us and the most dominant coach in europe in our history is insane. we all need to put a lot of respect on his name",

        "content": "Real Madrid has won multiple UCL titles with attacking players who aren\u2019t known for relentless pressing. Mbappe won a damn World Cup. Vini has two Champions Leagues, same with Rodrygo. Why can\u2019t pundits see the real issue is in midfield? Blaming Vini and Mbappe for everything is getting as tired as last season\u2019s obsession with the \u201chigh line.\u201d",

It was obviously a very frustrating match, but what were the positives you\u2019re happy about and the negatives that need to be fixed soon?\n\n\n\nAlso, how did you rate the individual player performances? Who do you think needs to improve their game moving forward, and who stood out in a positive way? Are there any players you believe should be benched based on today\u2019s performance, or others who have earned a place in the starting lineup? And considering the weaknesses we saw in this match, which position should be our priority for the next signing, and do you have any specific players in mind?\"\n",

        "content": "I am a native English/spanish speaker. See below for Xabi\u2019s views on Rodrygo.  Very telling in his observations. Ultimately good, but speaks to where Rodrygo\u2019s head was during the end of the season.\n\nQuestion from reporter: Have you talked to Rodrygo and have you expressed what you want from him  given what happened towards the end of the year with Carlo?\n\nXabi responded: \u201cI can tell you what we discussed to a certain extent. I know what happened and I know the end of the season was not easy for him. But in the end, he took time for himself that was good for him. He didn\u2019t play for Brazil and he was able to reset his head.\n\nWe spoke the first day and I see him with energy and effort. I see him enjoying himself on the pitch and overall. He has great quality, and discussed all the good he can do. We spoke, we shared ideas and now we have to put it into practice.\u201d\n\nConclusion: Xabi is optimistic about the future with Rodrygo but it\u2019s unfortunate that Rodrygo did struggle from team dynamics and his respective role. Concerned that he cracked under the pressure/circumstances.",

Nowadays it\u2019s so important and for sure it\u2019s something we have to address. And so far in just a few days, we have tried to do it. And, for the short term, and for sure in the long term, it\u2019s going to be very decisive in our performance\u201d\n\nCredits : @KiyanSo.\n\nGuess , we need to see in the CWC matches how everybody presses , including vini and Mbappe. Hopefully, we do as a unit instead of disjointed press.",

I get that his age is a positive factor and I\u2019m sure if he stays with the first team Xabi will make sure his development is not hindered.\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen him play in the league please share your thoughts about him.",
