He was only subbed for one game this season with a total of like 12 minutes.\n\nHe was a real bright spark in the Copa del Rey last season, and every time he played, he looked like a genuine goal threat.\n\nHe scored a goal every 121 minutes last season, despite mostly coming on as a late substitute in la liga. He was the top scorer in the Copa del Rey and produced some really nice goals.\n\nI agree that his overall game still needs improvement, but he brings that goal threat which most of our attackers except Mbapp\u00e9 (and to some extent Gonzalo Garc\u00eda) are lacking right now.\n\nYoung talent do not want to come to Madrid if they risk rotting on the bench for no reason.   \n",

He used to be this extremely passionate workhorse but we dont see that nowadays either. He plays like he's tired. Keep in mind this is the captain of real madrid we're talking about here. You wouldnt ever notice that he's the captain if it werent for his armband. This sub is going crazy about Jude and Arda but in reality Fede is the one who's been severly underperforming.

        "content": "Here's an example of why this couldn't be further from the truth:\n\nManchester City won a treble in 22/23 (in more dominant fashion than our double in 23/24) and yet last season most of their players were terrible. Now Ederson and Gundogan are playing in Turkey, Cancelo and Mahrez are playing in Saudi, De Bruyne and Rodri are injured all the time, Walker plays for the worst team in EPL, Grealish plays for Everton, others like Stones or Ake are washed, even Bernardo or Foden are nowhere as good as they used to be.\n\nApart from Haaland, the only ones who are as good or improved from their 22/23 squad are... Alvarez and Palmer, two players that ironically don't even play for them anymore.\n\nAnd this is just the most recent example, we've seen other teams winning trophies and then regressing a lot soon. Inter 2010, Chelsea 2021 are a couple of good examples. We've seen it with our own team as well. How good were the likes of Marcelo, Isco, Asensio, Varane etc. in 2018 and how these guys were performing a season or two or three later?\n\nI don't understand why people can't grasp the concept of players regressing, even if they won trophies in the near past. Doesn't matter if these players are in their 20s, don't have injury issues or they were very succesful recently. Dembele and Raphinha were both considered failures until a year ago, yet last season they were the two most influential players. Salah went from Ballon d'Or candidate to a completely painful to watch ghost of himself, in a matter of few months. Hazard was considered a top 10 player on earth when he joined us. Players get better and worse all the time, I know some people are too sentimental with our current squad, but it's time we should start accepting that fact, some players (not all of them) are already past their primes.",

And our 8, the English model who doesn\u2019t want to play 8 and makes a mess because he wants to play 10 and park at the front to score tap-ins and celebrate, but to play as a proper 8 and be useful for the team ? No it won\u2019t happen.\n And the big two stars Vini and Kylian who only want their personal benefit, not the team. The poor press they don\u2019t even do it.\nVini , who made the disrespectful action in the classico who loses the ball a million times in every match and become a winger can\u2019t get even agianst any Right back in 1v1 except some matches and we saw it and makes stupid decisions most of the matches this season,man even Bradley put him in his pocket \nAnd Kylian, who wants princess treatment. he won\u2019t press like the rest of the team; he doesn\u2019t want to tire himself every match. He just scores goals and celebrates, that\u2019s all.\n\nXabi obviously have faults but will it be Every time the coach faults? So Carlo was first now Xabi, Every time we will do the same mistake and blame the Coach and forget about the Ridiculous players ?",

People think just because he plays in ten roles we automatically win games. and I don't think he was better than Jude.\n\nI see so many people complaining about Jude's ball hugs, but like, if he didn't, we would just end up backpassing.\n\nI think today's game but Jude and G\u00fcler were meant to play CM, but they kept gravitating to their natural position. What do you think?",

        "content": "Hi, madridistas. \n\nI am going to Madrid at the end of this year, and I would very much like to watch the Real Madrid vs. Real Betis game on January 4, 2025.\n\nI'm Brazilian and I know I'm unlikely to return to Spain again. So this is a unique opportunity. Could you help me with tips on how to buy tickets to watch the game?\n\nI know it's very difficult to buy them online, and I'm already imagining that I won't be able to do it this way. I'm evaluating alternative options: buying directly through socios or buying through reseller websites.\n\nWhat would be the best option?",

If anything we've gotten worse: we're no longer doing those full commitment tackles to win the ball high up the field and our pressing has decreased (it wasn't really that good anyway).\n\nHonestly, besides Arda becoming a starter, everything that changed under Xabi has gone right back to being no different from when we had Ancelotti \n\nI know Xabi hasn't been our coach for that long, but c'mon, there should've been more of a difference by now \n\nI don't want Madrid to become like Manchester United, where we go years of being a shadow of our former selves\n\nThis so called second generation of galacticos already seems like a failed project... just like the one that came before it",
