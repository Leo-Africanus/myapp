        "content": "Injures and missed chances is yet again the reason we lose a crucial game.\n\nThis game was correctly directed by xabi from start to finish...Everything made sense, first 15 minutes we had 2 big 1v1 chances that were stupidly missed (we love passing the ball to joan garcia), which then led to the raphinha goal.\n\nVini was very good in the first half, becuase his main aim was to attack and press tf out of kounde (which he succeeded at), but then came the second half where we missed more than 6 1v1 chances because of how reckless our finishing is. Our players have SBT syndrome (Shoot before thinking syndrome), no one sees the net when they want to shoot in tight situations, they just air it and hope for the best. We could have the most perfect build up play in years and our attackers somehow always fail to finish it, even when they're right infront of the goal\n\nOur midfield in terms of composure was shyte, but in terms of getting the ball to the final third and work rate they were actually decent. the 2 chances we missed in the first 20 minutes is the first reason why we lost this game. I really cant blame anyone rn, everyone did their job.\n\nThe subs by xabi were nothing but common sense, valverde was clearly limping a bit and was already booked, thats just what every manager with a brain would do. Vini was subbed off because he was clearly tired, he was letting way too many passes go through and was jogging while losing 3-2 instead of pressing.\n\nFinal review: Solid game in terms of work rate (especially jude and cama), but i must repeat, the chances missed has really let us down again, In the first 20 minutes and the last ones, all of those chances ended up in a state where our player passes the ball to joan garcia, and it happened 3 times in the last 2 minuts alone. And i repeat injuries is the MAIN reason why we lost today, xabi orchestrated the perfect plan with the little options he had. And the missed chances were just the chillies on top.\n\nPS: Our defense has been shit for almost 3 years now, there is no point of me writing the same sh\\*t after every game, just act like i crashed out about it again.",

        "content": "  First I wanna say that he has been at a big disadvantage. The team has been full of injuries, our players have played horribly, we lack creative midfielders, and solid defenders. However, one thing I dislike is how much he changes his lineups. What I mean is that the play style from match to match varies way too much. This doesn\u2019t let the team get used to one proper formation. Today he chose to park the bus, which in my opinion is a bad move. On top of that he chose to play Valverde back in midfield. He was doing insanely good at RB, and changing him to midfield changes the game a lot.\n\n   So, what is the best way to line up (obviously my opinion). We should play a high press football, and really stress it. I know our players don\u2019t want to press, but that is what fits our team. Most of our players are physical players, capable of running 90 mins and winning the ball. I also wanna mention that by playing Tchoumeni at CB, the whole midfield is a lot worse. He is one of the best ball winning CDM and the best at Madrid. I believe that our only chance of getting the best out of the team is playing physical football that centers on pressuring so the other team can\u2019t build play. Counter football wouldn\u2019t work since we have a bad defense and little ball progression. ",

        "content": "I feel like Fede\u2019s injury was just completely debilitating. It turned him into a defensive burden, he needed Asencio\u2019s help, and as a result that caused Tchou to basically play the full 90 minutes as a CB. That allowed either Yamal or Raphinha (mostly Yamal) to drop into midfield to fill the vacuum and essentially create a 4v2 scenario in midfield, with Jude and Cama by themselves.\n\nAlso, in contrast to the Atleti game where Fede and Rodrygo were able to combine to create a goal down the right flank, Fede\u2019s injury also caused the right flank to be completely dead today. All of our attacks were concentrated on the left, with Rodrygo coming to the left to help combine with Vini. We were able to create chances when Vini was doing well, but obviously it\u2019s not ideal to only have one functional flank and not two of them.\n\nIt didn\u2019t get any better when Fede got substituted, because obviously Asencio isn\u2019t capable of bringing life to the flank, so it\u2019s not like starting without Fede in the XI and putting Asencio at RB from the beginning would\u2019ve been a good option. Vini being forced to come off from cramps was, of course, yet another big blow, but not much could be done about that.\n\nIf Xabi was going to do anything differently, there only really two options I can think of:\n\nStarting David Jimenez at RB rather than Valverde \u2014 no one\u2019s blaming Xabi for not doing this of course, this is too big a game to trust a Castilla player that\u2019s only made one or two first team appearances. If Valverde was to be benched though, between Jimenez and Asencio, I would much prefer to see Jimenez at RB.\n\nSacrificing Rodrygo up front to play a 4-4-2 \u2014 maybe starting Guler or Ceballos would\u2019ve given the midfield more of a chance to have better control and avoid leaving Jude and Cama stuck in that 4v2 battle. But we know that Guler can often be a defensive liability, and it\u2019s hard to argue Ceballos would provide a better net-positive than Rodrygo. Rodrygo did have some fitness doubts though, but our attack probably would\u2019ve felt more toothless without him, so I think he was necessary.\n\nAre there any other ideas I\u2019m missing that could\u2019ve led to a better performance? Or is it reasonable to just chalk this loss down to the injuries?\n\nSidenote: If we\u2019re not going to sign any new midfielders until the summer, we need to learn if Thiago Pitarch is a feasible option for us. Guler and Ceballos shouldn\u2019t be the only other midfield options we have.",
