        "content": "Tough defeat today, but I see this a lot in the threads :\n\n\"We have 3 nuclear weapons in the front and we don't know how to use them, it's coach's fault\"\n\nStupid take. That would be the case if you're playing FIFA on PS5. What you have is 3 fast right footed midgets, with brute force players in the midfield without a single one with decent build up quality to link defense and offense, and in the back, you have literally no fullbacks !\n\nThe front 3 is attractive, but not balanced ! Perez ruined a very good squad by buying a player we didn't fucking need and NOT replace 4 key players :\n\n1. Joselu, a tall cunt that wins most of his aerial duals and is always a threat in crosses. He was a downgrade of Benzema but thank god we had him to mix up our offense last season and he was VERY important !\n2. Kroos, a midfielder who has guaranteed &gt;90% pass accuracy,\n3. Nacho, a player who plays all positions in the defense\n4. Carvajal, our ONLY RB since 2014\n\nWatch the board buy another Brazilian midget by the end of the season !\n\nXabi Alonso, Klopp, Guardiola, Mourinho, none of them, separated or combined in any fucking way, will achieve shit with this squad either ! Easy to call out 'Carlo has no tactics' but you don't win chess games on high level with 6 bishops instead of the other pieces ! You need 2 Bishops, 2 Knights and 2 towers !\n\nCould Ancelotti have managed this season better ? Yes. Is he fully to blame ? Absolutely not and don't forget to shit on the board before shitting on the coach. Man asked for Harry Kane but got a CAM Bellingham so he switched the entire formation to fit him for a false 9 and it worked thanks to Vini wonder season.. So Perez decided to do this every fucking time because the next Brazilian midget he will buy will play as a left back because the board is to lazy to splash cash on an ACTUAL LB.\n\nY'all realize we have been playing for most of the season with 2 defenders in the 4 backline ? Tchou moved to CB and LV as RB are not their positions, Ancelotti's fuck up is not playing Asencio earlier, but it's sad to watch Alaba being average, then Fran comes in and he is just worse, together with Mendy's performances in this season. I don't need to talk about LV.\n\n3 Lewandowskis in the front won't work ! 3 Harry Kanes won't work ! 3 Sakas won't ! 3 Viniciuses won't work ! You need an actual number 9, an actual RW and an actual LW, but instead we have 3 LWs and people are like 'Any coach will destroy Europe with MVR' because they do in career mode on their PS5.\n\nWe can't win the UCL every season. Congratulations to Arsenal. Hala Madrid !",

If the penalty is given against Madrid then it is, \u201c cry Madrid you will lose\u201d, but if it is in favor of Madrid then it is robbery. It is like being the best club makes people cry out since they have no other way of matching its greatness. ",

        "title": "Football is played on the pitch, not on social media.",
        "content": "I\u2019ve said it multiple times and I\u2019m going to say it again: Carlo needs to leave. He needs to leave because a legendary manager cannot continue to tarnish his legacy by what was being displayed by his players and by himself. Today, 7 out of 42 crosses were successful, Vazquez was seemingly one of our best players and the attitude of some players that are supposed to be leaders was downright embarrassing. Just like the title says, you play on the pitch, not on social media. \n\nThis is a lesson for the Instagram warriors that are our players and the admin of the club\u2019s account. For an entire week, we\u2019ve heard them say \u201cRemontada this, remontada that\u201d or \u201cwe\u2019re going to comeback\u201d or even \u201cremontada has been the most used word in the dressing room\u201d when a remontada DOESN\u2019T come out of thin air. 3-0 against Wolfsburg was thanks to a brilliant Cristiano Ronaldo, 3-1 against City in 2022 was thanks to a brilliant Rodrygo, Courtois and Benzema and etc. Do you guys see a pattern here? Every remontada has been thanks to players trying their hardest because they believe that they can do it and that they don\u2019t need to talk on social media to play their football. But what about today? We had:\n\n- Rodrygo Silva de Goes who has been invisible, yet AGAIN. His last goal being against Atletico back in march. \u201cOnly idiots forget the R\u201d. I know that he\u2019s playing out of position, but Raphinha has been playing out of position since the beginning of the season and is at 50 G/A+. Great players should always perform even if they play out of position.\n\n- Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 Lottin who wants to play as a central midfielder instead of making runs in behind. \u201cAdaptation period is over: I\u2019m going to be the one deciding matches now\u201d\n\n- Vinicius Jos\u00e9 Paixao de Oliveira Junior who, despite being the best out of the three tonight, has been seen hugging the touch line too much instead of exploiting the space centrally when Mbappe wasn\u2019t there and playing with Alaba when he was overlapping in the first leg. \u201cI\u2019m going to do it 10x more, they are not ready.\u201d\n\nWhat I hate the most in football are people who like to talk days before the actual game. We put out a disastrous performance in the first leg and you would think that the players and the coaching staff would learn from their mistakes and prepare at least **something** against Arsenal, am I right? I can understand that we\u2019re playing against the best defence in the Premier League, but this doesn\u2019t excuse the lack of solutions from Ancelotti. I mean, Courtois said in an interview that the players are doing what Ancelotti is telling them to do, they want to respect his wishes. Spamming crosses to nobody in the box or refusing to play out from the back isn\u2019t how you\u2019re going to win matches. Time and time again in today\u2019s match, long balls were being spammed when we know that our front three has no aerial threat, so why are we doing that? And don\u2019t get me started on David Alaba. He never should\u2019ve started at LB.\n\nPutting the blame on the coach and the players is unfair, right? So, how about we talk about the so called \u201cruthless president\u201d that is Perez and the idiots that run our board? It\u2019s maddening how Perez thought that adding another left winger to a team that already has two was a great idea. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Mbapp\u00e9 is a fantastic player, but he sure as hell **WASN\u2019T** the player that Madrid needed. \n\nEveryone, Madridistas and neutrals, could see that Madrid needed a REAL number 9 to finally have the aerial threat that they had been lacking ever since Benzema left the club. Vini\u2019s best season has been when he had a number 9 to rely on so what does Perez do after seeing that we need a number 9 and that Joselu has been a fantastic player when it comes to aerial threat despite being on loan? He buys another left winger because Galactico! The result is a disjointed attack with three guys that want to play on the left, leaving 34 years old Lucas Vazquez essentially playing as the RW and Valverde running from defence to attack just to cover the gaps left by Vazquez. But hey, the board is there to help, right? Of course not. We have bums that consider Eder Militao, 2 ACL injuries in two years by the way, the \u201csigning\u201d of next season. Bums who clearly see that we desperately need fullbacks but chose to renew Vazquez. Clueless idiots who will come out on an interview and say \u201cwe won two champions league, so everything will be okay\u201d when we are getting outplayed by every big team either at home or away. When will this circus end? When will these human beings finally acknowledge that our squad depth is embarrassing and that spending 50 millions on Dean Huijsen who has been fantastic for Bournemouth and Spain isn\u2019t something to be ashamed of? Is the club just a joke for them? I speak for every Madridista when I say that we love this club with passion and that we will continue supporting Real Madrid no matter what happens, but we are not idiots. We can see that the club is not going well and it is **INFURIATING** to see the people in power not doing a single thing to help this cause. Real Madrid is the greatest club in the world and a club with such a title should not be allowed to be so immature when it comes to transfers or squad depth. The board and Perez are supposed to be helping the manager with signings, so why aren\u2019t they doing it?",

And yet everyone is talking about a comeback and not to discount Real Madrid already. Arsenal fans are legit scared to celebrate the lead. If this was ANY other club it would be a done deal. Yet here we are.\n\nLETS FUCKING COOK.",

        "content": "I'm sure alot of you are wondering where we go from here.\n\nHeres what we know about next season:\nWe'll be signing TAA (not confirmed close enough)\nWe'll probably be getting a new manager in the way of Xabi Alonso\nWe have to play the stupid club world cup\n\nSpeaking on TAA. this whole thing is giving me mbappe vibes again. We have a whole attack which cant press or man mark if their life depended on it and we want to sign a RB who cant even defend. This just relegates valverde to a cm whose only job is to help TAA defend. Everyone kept thinking last season how is mbappe gonna fit into this side. And so many people said if anyone can figure it out its Carlo. Well look where that got us. And now its gonna happen all over again.\n\nNow a possible new manager and a club world cup coming up. When do we sack Carlo ( if we do). Do we do it before or after the club world cup. Will our new manager have enough time to instill his new tactics. Its takes a whole preseason to atleast get the squad  comfortable with a change. Look at how amorim has struggled to get his tactics across. Imagine if flick had a half a preseason at barca. This club world cup is just adding alot of confusion. Add in a possible mix of new player and it gets even worse\n\nBut one thing is clear from this whole debacle, if one man is to take the blame for this its Perez. Its like his whole plan was Carlo will figure it out. You cant play 11 players on the pitch on vibes and you certainly cant run a whole football club and its recruitment on vibes. I can only hope common sense prevails at the club somehow.",
