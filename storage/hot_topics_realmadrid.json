We have all kinds of players who have physical ability, finishing ability and dribbling ability name what you like. But low blocks are always going to be harder to score.\n\nOur midfielders don't have that capability. Back then we have Ozil, Kroos or Modric who can pass the ball. Especially Ozil in my opinion\n\nBut right now the game demands more consistency since we have more tight situations with intense pressing. Especially in the right flank we lack the most creativity until Trent.\n\nPS: Mbappe scored that goal in case some one who doesn't rememeber. I didn't want to stir up more \\*player fc\\* because this is very important.\n\nEdit: I also forgot Marcelo. He was also a great passer of the ball. Also a selfless player.\n\nMy point is that we need players on both flanks who can long pass the ball. That way we unlock the forwards very easily. \u200b\u200b",

        "content": "There has been a lot of push recently saying he should stay a fullback, and shouldn't complain about it. But as we can see from the match, RB does not utilize his skillset the best. He is forced to be too defensive and not contribute enough offensively. Remember that Trent pass to Valverde over the defenders where Valverde gave a 1v1 pass to Gonzalo with the goalkeeper? Could never have been possible if he was RB.\n\nIn our best season ever, 23/24, he was an RM. He is excellent at tackles, and at crossing the ball into the box. But most of his work as RB is tracking players, preventing runs into the box, stopping headers. All of which he's nothing special at.\n\n  \nAt RM, he can run box to box, as he loves to. Without the same amount of defensive duty, but still helping his fullback partner with the occasional amazing tackle (which he did with Trent yesterday). Let the RB stay back when it's time for defense, help them with tackling and winning the ball, then offensively, run with the ball down the wing, either pass to the winger or let the fullback make the overlap in which case he can stay behind to stop any counter attacks.\n\nHe can make runs into the box, and when the team is in the box with the RB involved in the attack, he can camp at the edge of the box so he can put his generational shooting talent to use (a talent which gets utterly wasted whenever he plays RB. His shooting and scoring rate goes down immensely).",
