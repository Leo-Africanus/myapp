Quick thoughts, anger, frustration, future lineups, players we should get rid of and sign, etc. Most of these posts have been removed.\n\nSimilar to the announcement that I made after the Arsenal loss, please direct these to the post-match thread and the open thread. There are too many posts going up right now that it\u2019s flooding the home page and most are getting removed. If your post is lengthy and generates its own discussion by itself, it could be posted in the future. There is too much urgency in the sub right now for everyone making their own post. \n\nThank you for your time \ud83d\ude0a ",

I am tired of Rudiger's temper, Carvajal and Lucas Vazquez as seniors are acting like children and Jude needs to not follow Vini's path. \n\nCarlo is known to always have been this chill manager that lets players do whatever they want. \n\nWe need a no nonsense manager. We saw how Arteta demanded respect and inlisted discipline into his players. Flick has shown that he can be a friend to his players and take no nonesense. \n\nI really hope Xabi is a manager that takes no bullshit. I dont care who you are, if you are lacking disciple, u need to get benched. \n\n\nI honestly love how Mbappe is coolheaded. Aside from that red card incident, i feel that he is not involving himself in these antics from our other players.",

A great team takes their loss like a champ especially when it's your own fault not the refs or the managers.\nSure the refs last decision was a little questionable but you can't throw or cuss him. \nThis issue needs to be addressed by club itself. Vini going down after every tackle, even me whos sitting thousands of mile away, watching on 360p on buffering stream can see that was  clear ball and then he has the audacity to ask for a card. The cherry on the top is that he then just gives up. No or very little attempt to retake the ball. \nBesides, it goes deeper after arsenal game carvajal was choking saka, rudi standing on mls like bruh come on. You're setting a bad example for the juniors. \nSomething really needs to be done, we've become a laughing stock Infront of the world.\n",

EVERY great team goes through something like this and the really great ones just stand up a season or 2 afterwards. It\u2019s normal. Let everyone hate, but do not be consumed by it. It won\u2019t be that long until we are back to winning stuff. Until then, get a new hobby, learn an instrument. If you had been watching this sport for long enough you\u2019d know this is just very temporary. ",

        "content": "I totally get our frustrations this season and I agree with many of the points already discussed by everyone. Madrid will succeed again. We always do. \n\nThat being said, in analyzing the season, I think we should be careful not to blame Mbappe for our failures. I'm not saying everyone is doing that but there seems to be a sense of buyer's remorse because he hasn't hit the heights we expected yet. \n\nThings will click. This young team needs clearer coaching, strategy and instruction as they enter their primes. We need those signings we all know of. Some players need to leave. Many players still need to mature their game. But Mbappe, for a \"sub-par\" season, just passed CR7's first season goal record and brought us back into the game yesterday.\n\nBefore he got here, most of us wanted that level of player up front. Once the team balance is figured out, it can be even better. Tchouameni said it well: We'll be back. In the meantime, let's not make the mistake of regretting the good things we already have. Like a free transfer World-Class Kylian Mbappe \ud83d\ude0c \u00a1Hala Madrid!",
