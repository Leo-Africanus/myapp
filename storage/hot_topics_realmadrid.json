        "content": "Hola Madridistas \ud83d\udc4b\n\nSorry if this deviates a bit from the usual posts here, but I thought some of you might find it interesting. My grandad recently gave me his collection of old matchday programmes from the 1960s and early 70s (he\u2019s a Chelsea supporter), and among them is this gem from a 1966 friendly between Real Madrid and Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.\n\nThe programme includes the starting lineups, notes about the players, and a fascinating snapshot of the Spanish league and Real Madrid at the time. It\u2019s such a cool time capsule of football history, and I figured some of you would appreciate seeing it. Some absolute legends from Madrid made appearances in this game including: Pirri (561 La liga matches, 172 goals, and ten La liga trophies), Amancio (9 La liga titles, later became honorary president of RM), Gento (The only player to win 6 European cups, and was voted as the greatest Spanish player of the 20th century), Zoco (12 seasons at RM, 7 La liga titles). Puskas also attended at the match and it says he was \u201cincluded for possible penalty selection\u201d. Unsure if he actually took one.\n\nTwo other interesting things to note is Zaragoza is spelt \u2018Saragossa\u2019 (unsure if this is the English spelling of the name) and Bar\u00e7a was still called CF Barcelona and not FC Barcelona as it is known today (not sure why).\n\n\u00a1Gracias, y Que tenga un buen d\u00eda!",

        "content": "Last season with the vulnerability we had on that right side he was forced back to cover the space and then blamed for his attacking stats, but still he helped us get past City and Atleti in champions. This man has been training with the best for 6 years now and already a legend with the crucial goals he has scored and trophies he has won. This season will be different and with the quality squad depth Xabi has at his disposal, we will be back on top. Maybe Rodrygo will leave next season for a guranteed starting role, but this season Xabi will prove to him how effective he can be under his system. That match against Oviedo with 17 shots in the first half is a glimpse of the low block monster Rodrygo is. People want to compare Rodrygo to Vini, but they are different players and have different strengths and weaknesses and with Xabi, the Invincible man, he will take advantage of that versatility. This season, mediapro won't be able to stop us.\n\nEdit:  \nMade the images more visible for people struggling to watch the video. ",

He's just like any other Real Madrid player who either starts or comes off the bench. Why would he receive any privilege over any other player? Last year, he played almost all of the matches for almost 90 minutes because he was Ancelotti's favorite, while others, like Arda, rotted on the bench no matter what they did. No matter how many chances they got, they failed to deliver.\n\nI don't understand the point of sharing a match from three years ago or posting a carousel of his images and acting like we should be ashamed that he's not a starter. If Xabi thinks he performs better in his position, he'll play; otherwise, he'll sit on the bench like the other players. Many talented players have come and gone from RM, but I've never seen one defended this heavily, even though he's not half as good as Ronaldo.",
