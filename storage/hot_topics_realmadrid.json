Very unfortunate considering that he is finally NEARLY back to his old self and could have potentially scored more goals, yet no one was there to back him up! This was supposed to be a huge game. How in the hell did we not have a proper plan?? \n\nMidfield and especially our NON-EXISTENT defense line in shambles! Embarrassing.\n\nAncelotti is very stubborn keeping his favourite boys in Starting XI and refusing to sub when we have a very talented stacked bench players waiting the whole game. He should be shown the door and take Lucas, Tchou and Mendy out with him. Useless coach.\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "Yes the loss was horrible \n\nYes it was embarrassing \n\nHowever....big picture Carlo has given Madrid a lot. Not just titles he has made Madrid into a dangerous team\n\nI took don't understand why he keeps playing Tchoumeni when he has Ascencio. I think it is a mistake. But Carlo sees things that none of us do.\n\nCarlo had one of the most humiliating defeats in our history. The loss in Istanbul. As a rule, you will get blown out from time to time. I realize that Madrid fans are waaay more demanding than us Milanistas but on balance....you will have more glory.\n\nCarlo avenged 2005 Istanbul with our last ever Champions League trophy. He also did it with a much weaker squad. \n\nI get that at this moment you think that Madrid should sack him.....but Milan's last CL appearance of note was in 2007. Since Carlo's departure we haven't done ANYTHING. Madrid were also struggling to win la Decima before Ancelotti. \n\nHe definitely has his faults and stubbornly sticks to the team that gave him glory. But he's truly a great and elite coach and person. \n\nJust being careful what you wish for.\nI can't see any other coach in the world agreeing to play with such little support after winning so much. Carlo is slowly but surely finding a way to play a forward line with three left wingers. Madrid has had an incredible injury nightmare and you are above Barcelona in the league. \n\nWhen it comes to Carlo, you have to take the good with the bad. Or maybe you can get someone who can do it all. I don't think that person exists. Look at how Pep has been suffering of late....and he spends quite a bit in the transfer market. You think Xabi is your saviour? Time will tell.",

        "content": "I see a lot of people blaming individuals players for this result and I completely understand your anger and frustration. I know most fans don't expect us to win every match and win every competition every season. What we do however expect is to be competitive in every match and every competition. See some good football and great goals and moments and if possible win at least one trophy.\n\nThe last 3 years as a madrid fan, I have to be honest, the football has been dreadful and our performances against the biggest teams have been extremely poor but through moments of individual brilliance we have overcome many adversities. This was largely due to the calibre and characters of the players we had so even though the likes of Nacho, Kroos, Modric, Benzema,Carvajal were getting on in age, they were serial winners who have been there and done it on the biggest stage for multiple years.\n\nIf you remember Rudiger wouldn't even make the starting 11 when he first came and even though we had frailties in our defence Ancelotti refused to make the change, it was forced upon him due to injury to both Alaba and Militao so don't be shocked the same thing is happening with Acensio. Ancelotti also doesn't improve players, he's good at feathering egos and setting the team up but there's so many aspects of the game the team is lacking.\n\nOur pressing is awful and teams can literally split our team open with one pass as evident from the 5th goal they scored. \n\nOur teams shape is completely poor, the players look slow and lack energy and out of ideas. They look completely lost of the pitch and don't seem to understand how to press as a unit. This isn't an individual problem it's a tactical one. Mendy is constantly being left 1 v 1 or 1 v 2 and Ancelotti doesn't do anything to solve this. Vazquez was constantly caught out of position and constantly letting players run between him and Tchouameni and Ancelotti doesn't nothing to solve this.\n\nMajor reason why we won the league last seaosn is due to Barcelona being worse than we are and champions league because of Vini and Bellingham coming up clutch in big games. We rarely keep a clean sheet EVER but we usually win by outscoring the opponent which is not going to work against the bigger teams. Our counter attacking which used to be the envy of teams is now one of the worst I've ever seen because we can barely successfully execute 2 3 passes to setup a counter. Mbappe and Vini rarely track back meaning we are constantly outnumbered when defending.\n\nThis issues are all coaching related because all Barcelona did different from last season to this is change managers and the squad is largely the same. It's almost like our team has no chemistry and no invention, no energy nothing.\n\nAncelotti out.",

Can some Carlo apologist explain to us why and how this team doesn\u2019t have a buildup pattern even after his 3 years?. Before it was pass to kroos or Long balls and after yesterday even Sean Dyche would be embarrassed. Also do tell why this team doesn\u2019t know how to press ever and expectedly got baited and opened up multiple times yesterday.",

        "content": "Before ya'll start getting mad at me, I just feel that mbappe has the potential to be as clutch as ronaldo if his keeps on going on the upwards trajectory he in on the past few months.\n\n3-4 months ago, he was the most shit player on the pitch. Today he was the best! He has had 20 ucl knockout goals in 30 games (6th highest overall and the most at his age) and 8 wc knockout goals in 8 games (Highest wc knockout goals tied with the legendary r9) with 4 coming in the finals. \n\nIt was around this age, when ronaldo started to explode in champions league scoring goals for fun and lots of them in the knockout stages. Can mbappe do the same for us? I mean he has scored 3 goals in 3 finals for us already. He has had his lows for us but to be fair it was a new league and team for his and he clearly needed time adjusting.",

Because of how wildly successful we\u2019ve been in the UCL against all odds, we just ignore the insane amounts of luck and individual carry jobs that won us the title, completely ignoring hours of mediocre football played. Nothing much will change. We\u2019ll see Carlo make some first half subs in the next 2 games or so to make it seem like he\u2019s changed, but nothing will change. We\u2019ll continue to play football like headless chickens waiting on Vini/Jude/Mbappe magic and leak from the back thanks to Vasquez and Tchouameni.",

He consistently sticks to his favorite starting players, lacks any tactical prowess and repeats the same mistakes every single time. Only reason we are still in contention is because our squad is better than 94% of the other European squads. \n\nI really hope the Xabi agreement is true, I really think he can take this team to the next level. Best of all he will rotate, bring new ideas/formations, and player instructions. ",
