        "title": "About Ancelotti and his legacy",
        "content": "Hey everyone,after yesterday welcoming of Ancelotti and today's National Team Call up,i've started to think not only about How Ancelotti impacted Madrid on his career,but also How he impacted my life before i Knew anything about Football.One of the reasons why i feel in love with Football and Real Madrid was Kak\u00e1,around '09,i didn't knew what was Real Madrid,How Madrid player,i Just wanted to support them Because of Kak\u00e1. And that Goes for a lot of Brazillian kids fell in love with Football and Madrid,but at anypoint i Knew who Ancelotti was at that moment.  Then,It came the Seasons,the i learned more and more about Football and How much he impacted not only Kak\u00e1,but all the amazing players From my country that made me excited to watch the sele\u00e7\u00e3o games. Vini,Rodrygo, Endrick,Milit\u00e3o,Casemiro,Marcelo,Lucas Silva,Douglas Costa,Rafinha, Thiago Silva,David Luiz, Kak\u00e1,Pato,R9,Dinho,Cafu and the list goes on and on.  All those players,not only impacted me,but impacted and imensurable amount of kids that love the beautiful game. And seeing him today,Receiving the Zagallo jacket(For the contexto: Zagallo(RIP) not only won the World Cup as coach but also as player,he has 4 World cups under his belt,2 as player and 2 as coach) From Felip\u00e3o the coach From the penta after becoming the most victorious coach of our history,It made me emotional,not only because of the impact he made on my life,but coming full circle and knowing that my family and friends will get a to know This Amazing Man,not only for what he made for our country,but for now what he's going to do with my country.",
