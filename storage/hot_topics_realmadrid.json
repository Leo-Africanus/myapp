A potential foul afterwards in the box is challenged for review by Arbeloa\n\n90'+2 - after a very long review, the ref decides no penalty\n\n\ud83d\udfe5 90'+6 - second yellow for Lamini who makes a stupid and unnecessary tactical foul while already on a yellow \n\nFT - a decent second half is too little after league leaders Tenerife had already decided the match in the first. A 1-3 loss against what is clearly the best team in the division is normally no shame, but with now 4 losses in a row and multiple players missing the next weeks due to the U20 World Cup + Fettal injured and Lamini now suspended, the situation is looking extremely dire and hopeless for Arbeloa's team.

I\u2019m sorry I love him but that double pivot of him and tchoumeni is a recipe for disaster and there is no way we can drop Tchouameni he is to crucial to the defense. Fede just offers nothing he doesn\u2019t try building up play or receiving the ball and moving it around. Maybe trying a few games with cama or ceballos as the pivot could help see what problems this team has and fix things. I know ceballos is good at maintaining possession, and cama likes to move around and move the ball with him while also offering other stuff. I don\u2019t want to overreact to a derby game since this is how stuff usually goes with Atletico. But it\u2019s just a thought.",

        "content": "\u26aa\ud83d\udca5 Brutal afternoon at the Metropolitano as Madrid get humiliated 5-2 by Atl\u00e9tico...\n\nApologies for the missed posts recently, been sick, but honestly after this performance I needed a minute to recover mentally too.\n\nThis was embarrassing. From the first minute we looked slow, sloppy, and out of ideas. The first penalty completely killed any momentum, and after that the team fell apart. Defensive rotations were a mess, set piece marking a disaster, and Xabi\u2019s substitutions were baffling, such as taking off Arda, our only real creative threat, while leaving the backline exposed.\n\nA handful of positives though. Arda\u2019s goal and assist, Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s strike. But even they couldn\u2019t hide the chaos. Most players looked lost, timid, or simply outmatched.\n\nA crushing derby defeat. Frustrating and a stark warning that a lot of work is needed if we want to compete this season. Genuinely. \n\nWhat do you think went wrong for us the most? The XI, the formation, or something more?\n\n\\- MadridNoir \ud83e\udd0d\ud83d\udc51",

        "content": "I am very old, so old that I remember Atletico was never a club that we ever cared about, this derby used to be absolutely meaningless, and that's why it's downright blasphemous for me that we are losing to them of all the teams. \n\n\nI think after leaking in 5 goals, we all can agree that defense has been absolutely shambolic. Our defenders are way too soft, way too malnourished, way too unsure that's why they were getting bullied by Atleti. We need a strong presence at the back, a Ramos type figure, who may be hated by the world, but will marshall the back 4, with plan, respect, physical presence and heart. We also need better physical and intelligence in midfield. The hole that was opened after Kroos going away, isn't filled yet, maybe Gueller will fill that in time, but till then, we need a Casemiro to sweep up the mistakes made by the midfield. \n\nToday I think that I can't really find Vini and Mbappe at fault, if we are leaking 5 at the back, our attack line up just can't get enough balls, confidence or ideas to beat opposition defense. Attack starts from defence and today, it was proven yet again, our back is absolutely killing us. Sadly it reminded me the era of Zidanes and Pavons.. Pavon was never good enough, this back 4 isn't either. ",

        "content": "   Both Bellingham and Valverde had a bad match, and have recently not been showing their best. Yes, I am aware that Bellingham just came back from an injury and that the whole team did bad. Bellingham and Valverde are one of my favorite players and I was excited seeing Bellingham come back. Leaving that aside, they are both physical players. They are very physically fit and capable of even being good attackers, like Valverde\u2019s long shots and Bellinghams crazy debut season. However, they do not fit in this system. A system of possession, quick play, and pressing does not work around them. Xabi wants to work with fixed positions, which is the opposite of them. They are both players who show their best when they are free to move around. Additionally, Bellingham plays a lot more like a midfielder now, but his best position is right below the striker. Bellingham should not be playing so deep since his capabilities are more attacking. For now, I think they should be benched until they hopefully get used to the system, or build a system that revolves around Bellingham for example. ",
