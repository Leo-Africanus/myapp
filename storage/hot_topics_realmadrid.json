Mastantuono, even if loses possession sometime, still creates chances for the team (just unlucky in finishing) and helps defensively too. Defense is a no brainer along with Mbappe, Tchoumeni and Arda. It was very tough to choose between vini and Rodrygo. The only way I can see Rodrygo starting is Vini being a super sub for him which has worked for us. Lastly, I chose Bellingham as we all know he will be a starter when he is back in some days.",

Dean is solid aerially as well (12/17)\n* Dean leads in ball carries, Vini at #2, Carreras is at #3\n* [Arda and Kylian have created the most chances this season so far](https://www.statmuse.com/fc/ask/most-chances-created-this-season?l=eu5)\n\n[Guler x Mbappe is the new Ozil x CR7 ?](https://preview.redd.it/z3jyaxkgn4qf1.png?width=987&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64bf9cd2d981b4117186f2287b860e2163e4e8b4)\n\n[Attacking Sequence Involvements in top 5 leagues so far](https://nitter.net/OptaAnalyst/status/1969018479056470196#m) :\n\n[Promising stats so far](https://preview.redd.it/n5bxv3smn4qf1.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=059d0b14caac588a4bad13d01eb7aeec0245af64)\n\n* 3/10 players are Madridistas\n* Carreras is a gift\n* How did we miss out on Olise?\n* Fede's new role is usually up for discussion &amp; criticism these days, the stats seem to suggest otherwise, many fans say he has lost his spark\n\nNOTE :\n\n* I know Barca has faced ***considerably*** weaker opposition so far, and the Violencia game is an outlier that kinda skews the data in their favour a lot\n* We played \\~60 mins as 10men vs LaReal\n* Although this is too early into the season to judge teams solely based on stats(I believe stats give out a more balanced picture only after around 10 matches), the eye test is still kinda valid and the stats fit with what we see on the field.\n* [Take the numbers, such as duels won or carries or dribbled past, etc. with a grain of salt, these numbers are often miscalculated and often misrepresent the quality](https://x.com/Hennes_4/status/1728541660194156883)\n\n[Stats can be decieving](https://preview.redd.it/t24vz105o4qf1.png?width=756&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40d4f5d7da2280fbb2a466a6148d96e0a59f9e00)\n\n  \nI initially posted in the Weekly Open Thread, but someone said this should be a post, so here it is.",
