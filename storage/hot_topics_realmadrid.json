The Welshman lamented the\u00a0**\"lack of quality\"**\u00a0in the final third, directly pointing to figures like Mbapp\u00e9 and Vinicius J\u00fanior:\u00a0**\"They didn\u2019t produce any magic. It was disappointing that in the final third there wasn\u2019t the quality you expect from Real Madrid\"**. A statement that highlights the club\u2019s reliance on individual brilliance that, on big nights, doesn\u2019t always show up.\n\nThis offensive shortcoming led Bale to identify a structural need: the arrival of a reference center forward. The former footballer explained that crosses and attacking moves were left without a finisher, an obvious tactical gap.\u00a0**\"Sometimes you need to go and test the defender. There was no one in the box for the crosses. Maybe you need a \u20189\u2019\"**, he concluded, hitting the nail on the head regarding the role of a classic striker.",

        "content": "Have you never had a bad day at work? Seriously. How can one bad game suddenly mean we\u2019re trash and need a lots of improvement? If Jude\u2019s chance had gone in, or if Mbapp\u00e9 had just had a slightly better game, this sub would\u2019ve been jerking off to \u201cmentality monsters\u201d posts right now. The hypocrisy is insane.\n\nJust saw a post with Mbapp\u00e9 circled in yellow like, \u201clook, he didn\u2019t close down on that Carreras run!\u201d \n\nBro, have you even *played* football? You think it\u2019s that fucking simple? You think all he had to do was magically predict the ball\u2019s bounce and slot it in? Be serious.\n\nEveryone has off days man. You, me, and our players. Liverpool were just better yesterday. That happens. You can\u2019t win every goddamn game. I wish we were the better team, we weren't. That's that.\n\nWhat really pisses me off though is the hate. The straight-up disrespect toward world-class players \u2014 it\u2019s pure *small dick energy*. You don\u2019t have to love everyone, but at least don\u2019t act like you could do better sitting on your ass behind a keyboard.\n\nIf you love this club, act like it. Stop scapegoating. Stop turning on our own. You think throwing shit on a player makes you a smart? No it just makes you look like a clown.\n\nGo outside. Touch some fucking grass. Play an actual 11v11 game. Try tracking back, closing down, finding a smart pass (like G\u00fcler tried before getting chopped down in the box), or making a perfect run. You\u2019ll realize half of what you complain about isn\u2019t that simple.\n\nAnd sure let\u2019s talk football, that\u2019s fine by me. For instance, Valverde was uncomfortable at times? Yeah. But he wasn\u2019t ass. He was just out of position. There\u2019s a difference. \n\nThe quality of this sub has fallen off a cliff.\nIf you love this club act like it. Stop being salty little crybabies every time we lose. \n\nOur club is stacked with quality, and we have a top manager too. If it was some other manager and we weren't defensively disciplined it would've been much worse. I am still confident we're the best team in Europe. THE BEST! A 1-0 loss changes nothing.\n\nHala Madrid Y Nada Mas \ud83e\udd0d\n",

Rodrygo on the other hand has been great for us playing as a sub but at this point he also wants regular game time and his preferred position is left as well. \n\nLast night as well we didn't have a threat on right wing hence it was predictable for liverpool . Ofc they were better than us and the we couldn't match their intensity. \n\nXabi is new as well and ancelotti have spoiled us by giving us 2 champions league with limited players he had and it has the downside as well which we saw last year in the form of injuries. we have been lucky with ancelotti and i don't know if luck will be on our side with Xabi or not but one thing that is certain that we need to sign players based upon our needs now. \n\nIt's our responsibility as fans to trust in Xabi because he knows his players and what to expect from them . We have certain set of players and by bringing the best out of them , we can have a goood season. Yesterday was just a bad game for our players and it happens once in a while tho we can't forget that we lost again liverpool , psg , arsenal and Barca 4 times last year and this year as well we have lost to Atleti and liverpool ( 2 big teams we faced) .

Gonzalo could come in for Mbapp\u00e9 after 60 minutes, especially if Mbapp\u00e9 has already scored once or twice.\n\nThese next few weeks could be great for testing new tactics and positions for players, and I'm worried that instead we're gonna get the same two or three systems that allow Mbapp\u00e9, Vini and Bellingham to stat pad, only for the next big match to be a let down when the team suddenly only has threat on the left wing or doesn't have a centerback that can handle physical pressure.\n\nIt's a great sign that the team is winning so much at this point, but if the crucial matches go like this, it might mean that some new things need to be tested",

There's no excuse not to win today, considering the form we are in and the form they have been in.\n\nI know it's a bit delusional considering it's the Champions League at Anfield after all, but I hope the game gets concluded by half time. Go 3 goals up, maybe sub off Mbappe if he has scored a goal or brace.",
