That they don\u2019t see the real issue - being our lack of defensive players. \n\nWe have a youth team that gets no trust, what kind of message does that send to younger players? We have Asencio who has showed game after game that he deserves a spot in the starting eleven, yet he\u2019s benched. We have to watch Lucas Vazquez make a fool out of himself week after week, my dead grandmother could defend better - I\u2019m sure someone in Castilla could do better than that, but no\u2026\n\nThe board and management has gone mad, and it shows in Carlo\u2019s press conferences lately\u2026 to blame the referees after yesterday\u2019s game won\u2019t get us anywhere, they need to wake up\u2026",

        "content": "Many of us saw comments about the situation with Mbappe. Some of them talked about pressure from the board to play Mbappe no matter what. The other were talking about Mbappe's slow start, and that he will start playing well no matter what. I can understand Carlo's decisions about Mbappe. Indeed, if Vini and Mbappe manage to find chemistry and a way of playing together, that would be awesome. Endrick is still super young and he will get his chances. \n\nOn the other hand, there is no way that the board or anyone is pressuring Ancelotti to play Vasquez on RB no matter what. It sounds absurd that we do not have better natural RBs/LBs from the academy. I believe Carlo and only Carlo is not letting them play. Even if you are the biggest doubter of this statement, look at what happened to Raul Asencio. He is way better than Tchouameni in the CB role, yet, Carlo's favoritism of the players is above everything. In addition, LB is nowhere better. Both Mendy and Garia are far from Real Madrid's level. \n\nI don't understand Carlo's fear of youngsters. How can somebody play worse than Vasquez? Do we really want a manager who lacks the ability to develop youngsters in an era where we are rebuilding the team? The same thing is happening with Modric. He is sacrificing the development of youngsters giving Modric every other game 90 minutes of playtime. ",

        "content": "It seems like 10 trophies in 3 seasons won by Ancelotti isn't enough to be trusted by a subreddit full of armchair football experts. So maybe a comparison of this season's results will put some light on how deluded this fanbase has become recently:\n\n*Season 24/25 all competitions*\n\nManager | Games | Won | Drawn | Lost\n---------|----------|----------|-----------|--------\nAncelotti | 24 | 15 | 4 | 5\nFlick | 23 | 17 | 2 | 4\nSimeone | 24 | 16 | 5 | 3\nXabi Alonso | 24 | 16 | 6 | 2\nGuardiola | 24 | 12 | 5 | 7\nArteta | 24 | 14 | 7 | 3\nMotta | 22 | 9 | 12 | 1\nDe Zerbi | 15 | 9 | 3 | 3\n\nAll these names were mentioned now or earlier as a clear step-up from Carlo \"Dinosaur with dementia\" Ancelotti, or just as names we should look on to when talking about world class managers. But are their results much better? No, they aren't. Did they have to face 27 injuries in the first squad since the start of the season, like Carlo did? No, only Flick and Guardiola faced a lot of injuries (but still not as many) and their results are similar to ours.\n\nBut if you read some posts on r/realmadrid, you'll be thinking that Ancelotti has some kind of an abysmal record this season, and that coaches like Xabi or Arteta would certainly do wonders in Madrid. This is based on absolutely nothing.\n\nIf you want to fire a manager who got 10 trophies in 3 seasons, including 2x UCL title, when we still have a chance for every trophy this season, you're just lacking spine and faith. This isn't video game and having great players doesn't mean the club will trash every team 4-0, the season is always full of ups and downs and it was like that even with Zidane winning 3 UCLs in a row. Stop being delusional and start actually SUPPORTING the club, have some fucking faith. We really don't need more plastics who turn their backs on the club, manager and players every time we lose some points. There are a lot of them already, and we as a sub should do better.",

        "content": "One thing I praised Ancelotti for in the last season was his ability to always find a solution even when he\u2019s faced with a lot of serious injuries. When his starting CBs were injured, the usage of Tchouameni at CB proved to be really helpful as his physical abilities were what Madrid needed in that area. But, this season? Hermano, what\u2019s going on? There is absolutely 0 reason as to why I keep seeing Lucas Vazquez on the starting eleven. Any elite winger can pass him, he is defensively shaky and when the pressure is too much for him, he concedes penalties. Last season against Braga, he concedes a penalty and against Bayern away he concedes another one. The reason why this season is becoming painful to watch is when you realize the talent that Ancelotti refuses to use to HIS advantage for the sake of the team. We all saw what Raul Asencio, a castilla player, had in his pocket when he finally got his chance. A strong, aggressive and capable CB who captivated every fan is now rotting on the bench again. \n\nIn an interview, Carlo said that his job was not to give youngsters a chance but to get results. While I agree with a little bit of his statement, I have to disagree with the rest. Sure, you don\u2019t want to give your youngsters a chance to prove themselves, but how do you want results with Lucas Vazquez as your RB? Why not give the youngsters of Castilla a chance and see if, like Asencio, they are capable of filling the spot? We like to blame the board a lot for the fact that we didn\u2019t sign a lot of players, but we have an academy filled with talent that is desperate to help the squad.\n",

        "content": "#FT: CASTILLA 2:1 RECRE\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#1\u00aa FEDERACI\u00d3N\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:** \n\n1:0 Gonzalo Garc\u00eda 9'\n\n1:1 Rub\u00e9n Serrano 32'\n\n2:1 V\u00edctor Mu\u00f1oz 53'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - kickoff, vamos! \n\n\u26bd 9' - GOLLLL DEL CASTILLA - free kick from the right nicely delivered by specialist David Jim\u00e9nez, Gonzalo gets an open header in the centre of the box and places it perfectly into the bottom left corner! Deserved lead for Castilla who have been pushing hard for the lead here already \n\n17' - V\u00edctor's shot is deflected, leaving the keeper without a chance, but it hits the post and goes out for a corner - Castilla now pushing for the second\n\n20' - next chance for V\u00edctor, but the keeper parries from a tight angle! \n\n\u26bd 32' - goal for Recre - first time they have some dangerous possession and they get a corner.. It's played short and the cross is brought in from deep, Fran Gonz\u00e1lez storms out of his goal into absolute nowhere and Rub\u00e9n Serrano can head it into the empty net... You just can't win matches with a keeper that fucks up so frequently... \n\nHT - great start by Castilla who scored early and had multiple chances to extend their lead - then what happened is what always happens, the team gave up control completely, got scored on in basically the first opportunity, and has struggled to show any reaction since then - they lack any consistency even within the duration of one half, they need countless chances to score a single goal, then concede with one stupid blunder - impossible to win matches like this\n\n46' - 2nd half underway \n\n\u26bd 54' - GOLLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - Gonzalo turns his man and marches forward through Recre's midfield, then releases a great through ball to Victor, who keeps his calm and finishes near post with force! Now we need to hold the lead this time around... \n\n\ud83d\udd04 71' - Pol Fortuny off for Loren Aguado \n\n\ud83d\udd04 85' - Victor Valdepe\u00f1as on for David Jim\u00e9nez \n\nFT - a small fight breaks out after the final whistle, not sure what it was about - doesn't matter, 3 super important points for Castilla in the battle against relegation. The team started both halves very well, scoring after exactly 8 minutes played in either half and having chances to amplify their lead. Then they gradually lost control and allowed Recre back into the game, but in the second half, Ra\u00fal's team managed to defend the lead with maturity and calmness. Sadly, the team continues in the relegation zone for yet another matchday, but on the other hand only one win/3 points seperate 8th place from 16th in this crazy division \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 12:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee**: Sergio Escriche Guzm\u00e1n \n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 2, Matchday 17\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[FEF TV](https://feftv.com) (subscription - 12.99\u20ac/month)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-2-3-1): Fran Gonz\u00e1lez - Youssef Enr\u00edquez \u2018Yusi\u2019, Mario Rivas, Quique Ribes, David Jim\u00e9nez (85' V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as \u2018Valde\u2019) - Jos\u00e9 Maria Andr\u00e9s \u2018Chema\u2019, Antonio David - David Ruiz, Pol Fortuny (71' Loren Aguado), V\u00edctor Mu\u00f1oz - Gonzalo Garc\u00eda \n\nBench: Diego Pi\u00f1eiro (GK), Mario de Luis (GK), Cristian David, Hugo de Llanos, Jacobo Ortega.\n\nUnavailable: David Cuenca (pubalgia), Ra\u00fal Asencio (first team call-up), Pablo Ram\u00f3n (ACL tear), Jacobo Ram\u00f3n (muscle injury), Edgar Pujol (?), Manuel \u00c1ngel (muscle injury), Andr\u00e9s Campos (?), C\u00e9sar Palacios (ACL tear), Borja Alonso (muscle injury), Jeremy de Le\u00f3n (shoulder injury), Loren Zu\u00f1iga (muscle injury). \n\nCoach: Ra\u00fal\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** WLDWL\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 19th | 16pt | 3-7-6 | 24:19\n",

Intentional and cynical fouls to break counters and no cards. Rayo had 18 fouls and was given 4 yellows and one was for dissent. I don\u2019t get it and that\u2019s before we talk about at the minimum VAR checking for a pen. I just don\u2019t understand the officiating tonight it was poor.",
