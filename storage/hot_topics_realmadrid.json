        "content": "Don't focus on him being a left winger because he can use both feet equally, similar to Dembele. He also wants to stay in Spain, he has been dealing with injury issues and isn't looking to start every single game. He's only 22 years old and valued at 70 million euros with a release clause at 58 million euros. If Nico wants to join, then why would Madrid refuse? This season Mbappe, Vini, and Rodrygo all have had injury troubles. Having Nico would let Xabi have an insanely competitive team even when one of those players aren't playing. And if it doesn't work out, then he can be sold at a good price in 4 years at 26 years old. There is very little risk and he is one of those players that has the ability to produce magic. He also is pretty tall and is good at pressing and intercepting for a forward. I think Xabi can really elevate his ability. ",

        "content": "\nThe new Real Madrid under Xabi Alonso is exciting, not because of big signings, but because of the tactical potential and development of players we already have.\n\nPeople keep saying we need a new Kroos. A midfield controller. Someone who dictates tempo, creates passing lanes, and calms the game. And I agree. But that doesn\u2019t mean we need to buy one. Great coaches develop that kind of player.\n\n1. Jude Bellingham\nBellingham absolutely has the tools to become that kind of midfielder. Great ball control, strong in duels, physically dominant, and with the technical quality to pick passes. Yes, he plays further up right now. But remember, Pirlo used to be more attacking before he became a regista. Even Modric made that shift. With the right guidance, Bellingham can evolve into a complete playmaker.\n\n2. Fede Valverde\nAt the start of this season, Valverde was taking on more creative duties in midfield. He was distributing well, linking up play, and breaking lines. That role faded when he had to cover wide areas, but he\u2019s more than capable. His stamina, vision and drive make him a perfect fit for a modern tempo-setter.\n\n3. Eduardo Camavinga\nWhen people mention someone like Angelo Stiller, I always think Camavinga has a very similar profile, and honestly, a much higher ceiling. He\u2019s press-resistant, great on the turn, and reads the game well. Why not develop him instead of looking elsewhere?\n\n4. Arda G\u00fcler\nPhysically he\u2019s less imposing, which makes it harder to see him in that deep role, but in terms of technique, vision, and creativity, Arda\u2019s got it. Under the right coach, he could grow into something special, maybe not as a regista, but definitely as a playmaker between the lines.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m hyped for the Xabi Alonso era. Not because I expect a transfer spree, but because I believe he has the intelligence and background to shape these players into something bigger. We don\u2019t need to spend 60 million on the next \u201ccontroller\u201d when we might already have two or three waiting to explode.\n\nLet them grow. Let them shine. Let\u2019s build something.\n\nHala Madrid.\ud83e\udd0d",

        "content": "I mean sure, he's not good enough to make the right tactical change/choice in the right time. But he really tried his best and brought many positive things to the team.\n\nLopetegui failed badly not just because his tactic ability, but he wasn't brave enough to make changes. Solari realized it and took off quite a few big names who had past their prime: Marcelo, Bale and Isco. At the same time he gave all the youngster chances, not just Vini but also Ceballos, Llorente and Reguilon. Valverde also had a little time. They could all have been part of the squad. That require a lot of guts and let the next coach could continue with this route.\n\nMy biggest issue with Zizou in his 2nd spell is that he brought back the old veterans and sold/loan most of these players, or not trust them too much. Especially Marcelo shouldn't have gotten that much time.  \n\nHe also made sure Courtois as the 1st keeper.",
