        "content": "Xabi is a great manager with great ideas, so I attribute this more to him having no control over what he can do. Something I dislike about Xabi is how reluctant he is to play academy players or young prospects. Unless he is in a deep crisis with no players available, he will not give them a chance. Seeing Mastantuono and Guler play so much at the start of the season, makes me believe that it is not his decision, but rather the board\u2019s.\n\nAncelotti was also amazing, but one of the complaints many had (including myself) was that he refused to play talents. This is something that seemed was going to change with Xabi, but we are back to square one. I think playing young players who many times have better performances and more passion may be better. We may find a gem capable of getting into the first team like what happened with Asencio. I think the most important factor is the passion and willingness to prove themselves that prospects usually have. Hopefully we can change this mentality. \n\n",

This means that when Bellingham is not in the starting eleven, the team has a 100% win rate.\n\nWhen Bellingham has started in the first eleven, they have won 7, drawn 3 and lost 4 out of 14 games. Their win rate has dropped to 50%.\n\nWhen Bellingham has started in the first eleven, they have scored 21 goals and conceded 15.\n\nWhen Bellingham didn't play, however, they scored 10 goals and only conceded 3. \n\nIn the 20 games he has played, he has scored 5 goals and provided 3 assists.\n\nDespite being a free attacking player, his goal involvement is very low when compared to Mbappe, who has three times the goal involvement in these games.\n\nYou can see that an offensively minded, free-roaming Bellingham makes Madrid too unbalanced. \n\nWithout Bellingham, the average goals scored per game is 2, and the average goals conceded is 0.6.\n\nWith Bellingham goalscoring 1.5 per game and conceding 1.07 goals.\n\nThis shows that Bellingham needs to be given a different role or be dropped entirely. His current role is only making the team worse.",

        "content": "Vinicius has every right to be upset with Real Madrid fans if they boo him or any other player. However, Vinicius himself must not forget that those whistles did not come because of a single moment or an one mistake, but rather due to a long and repeated period of underperformance.\n\nLast season (2024\u20132025), Real Madrid were leading La Liga by a seven-point margin, only to throw it away. This season, they were once again on top with a five-point lead, which they lost in a short period of time, allowing Barcelona to move ahead by four points. These are things we don't  forget.\n\nVinicius numbers this season also cannot be ignored. He has scored only five goals in 24 matches statistics that are not even acceptable for a mid-table team. In his last 14 matches, he has not scored a single goal and has provided only three assists. In 12 matches, he did not contribute either a goal or an assist. If mid-level teams would not accept such numbers, how can a club that aims to win major titles like La Liga and the UEFA Champions League accept them?\n\nVinicius reaction was not limited to showing frustration or expressing discomfort. He went further by changing his profile picture and replacing his Real Madrid image with one of himself representing Brazil. At that point, the issue shifted from a conflict with the fans to a problem with the club\u2019s management.\n\nNow the Real Madrid board must ask itself: what exactly should Vinicius be forgiven for?\n\nFor his recurring issues with the coach?\n\nFor embarrassing the club on the biggest moment during El Cl\u00e1sico, portraying Real Madrid as a team lacking discipline and an administration unable to control its players?\n\nFor demanding the highest contract in the club\u2019s history?\nOr for his unconvincing performances on the pitch?\n\nVinicius has exhausted his credit with everyone. If he does not take responsibility, reassess himself, and significantly improve his performances at the beginning of next year, the situation may go beyond the end of his career at Real Madrid. He could find himself unwanted even by Europe\u2019s biggest clubs.",

That was pretty embarssing\n\nMan Utd is a perfect example of a top club facing downfall, they dominated in 90s, 20s and even early 2010s, but since fergie their downfall started and it's not stopping anytime soon\n\nReal Madrid are a top club and always have stayed there, I just wanted to know that when did real Madrid faced their worst downfall? And what are the reasons that real Madrid never face downfall and consistently have competed with top clubs?",
