But when their moments came, everything flipped.\n\nJacobo got his chance in a low pressure Copa del Rey game and looked way out of depth. \n\nAsencio? He wasn't even supposed to play. He was thrown in mid-game at the Bernab\u00e9u against Osasuna unprepared (after Milit\u00e3o's first half ACL) yet he delivered a masterclass and hasn't put a foot wrong since. Now he's starter for Real Madrid.\n\nTo succeed at the biggest club in the world, with all the pressure that comes with it, talent/quality alone isn't enough. Character is just as important.\"\n\nCredits: Johnhonesty from X\n\nAnd I completely agree with the part about Asencio. Character, mentality, aggression, hunger, and intent matter too, alongside talent, and Asencio has everything. He looks hungry, his will to prove himself deserving of playing for Real Madrid makes him superior to his counterparts. I'm so happy to have found that kid. Thanks to Militao's injury. Okay, I know I shouldn't say this, but still... his injury led us to Raul Asencio, so yeah, sometimes good things come out of miseries, and Raul Asencio is one of them.\n\n",

        "content": "There is a some rumbling about RM not giving chances to youth or Ancelotti having age bias. I think when we compare Asencio to Endrick and Guler we can see a difference in consistency that highlights what Ancelotti wants.\n\nAsencio had a worse starting point then either Guler or Endrick who arrived after already leaving many coaches and viewers impressed with their performances elsewhere. However Asencio was largely an unknown quantity in a club that doesn't typically take many players from it's academy.\n\nAncelotti put him in since he had no other options, not because he has a comparable reputation and came for lots of money and thus needed to justify the investment. However, after an okayish start, Asencio proved very reliable and consistent and has clearly small but steady improvements with each game. This is despite the fact that we are talking about a defender whose mistakes are a lot more eyecatching and destructive to team confidence and results.\n\nOn the other hand, each time Guler and Endrick play, you get something different. Their performances are highly inconsistent and they are prone to unusual decisions that don't really work best with a team that relies on relationism where the important thing is being able to predict what your teammate will do next.\n\nIf you watch how others react to movements of Asencio, you can see they understand his decisions. You can see Tchou and Modric drop to fill his space because as soon as he goes towards a rival player, they know he is going for a duel or a tackle and how much time and space he will dedicate to that task. This makes the team calm and everyone can focus on the next move instead of being concerned about what is happening right now.\n\nThis is also why Real Madrid can have so many counterattacks. Asencio wins a duel, pivots like Cama, Modric or Valverde hit a long ball and the forward 3 know it is time to sprint like crazy.\n\nBut when you have doubt and lack of consistency, that creates hesitation and waiting and many opportunity pass by. Goalkeeper gets into position, defenders organize and so on. It also leads to frustration and blaming.\n\nThere should be more understanding of Ancelotti. He is among the best coaches and he knows what he is doing and he has a system sensitive to inconsistency. I am not saying those two won't get to turn out how their fans expect but they require a lot more coaching to hone their edgy and unpredictable tendencies while some players are much more natural fits to his tactic.",
