        "content": "Hi there,\n\nI\u2019m looking to sell a Karim Benzema signed jersey that comes with a Certificate of Authenticity (COA) from the Real Autograph Company. I\u2019m asking $300, and I will cover the cost of shipping to make the transaction easy and straightforward.\n\nThis jersey was received as part of a collection, and while I know Benzema is a highly respected and accomplished player, soccer isn\u2019t a sport I follow closely. Because of that, I\u2019d really like to pass this piece along to someone who truly appreciates his career and legacy. From what I understand, Benzema has had an incredible impact on the game, especially during his time with Real Madrid, making this a meaningful item for any fan or collector.\n\nThe autograph is clean, clear, and well-placed, and the jersey itself is in great condition. The COA from the Real Autograph Company provides assurance of authenticity. This would make a great addition to a sports memorabilia collection, a display piece for a fan cave, or even a unique gift for a soccer fan.\n\nI\u2019ve priced this at $300 to be fair and reasonable, especially considering I\u2019m including shipping. I\u2019m happy to answer questions, provide additional photos, or share details about the COA for anyone who is seriously interested. I want this to go to someone who will genuinely enjoy owning it.\n\nIf you have any interest or would like more information, please feel free to reach out. I can answer any questions you may have and provide proof that this is a legit item and not a scam like there are of many on this app. Thanks for taking the time to read, and I appreciate your consideration.",

I am planning a trip to Madrid in early February, my family has always paid very good attention to Real Madrid and we are genuinely happy when Real wins as i have family in Spain aswell that are madridistas. So i would just like to know if you guys are ok with the \"tourist fan\", I'm a Benfica fan and we have quite a big problem with that kind of people because they just go watch the game with phone in hand and couldn't care less about the team, i think I wouldn't be like that, if possible and if you can tell me where I'd love to go to a zone where proper fans reunion (maybe not the ultras tho, cuz if they're like ours it's way too crazy for a foreigner), so would it be easy for me to get tickets to the first 10/15 days of February and to what zone, if possible, should i aim to go? Thanks in advance and I'll see u in Lisbon for UCL football.",

After a blocked shot, the rebound falls for him at the edge of the box, his curled shot is almost perfect, hits the bar and bounces back down and out\n\n15' - Arbeloa asks for a review after a potential foul against Y\u00e1\u00f1ez in the box - for me it's a pen, the defender clearly sticks his leg out at the last second\n\n19' - 4 minutes of revision and for some reason, he doesn't see a penalty\n\n45' - huge save by Fran, who is faced with a shot from short distance after Aguado slips in the box and has to speculate on the side he picks to jump to - he anticipates correctly and is already in the corner to save the shot once it travels goalwards\n\n47'+3 - and again Fran with another huge save! Ochoa, who is the best (outfield) player on the pitch, chases a long ball and dribbles easily past Liberto and Diego Aguado, and finishes near post, but once again Fran has the right instincts and covers the near post with his foot to deny Arenteiro's lead again\n\nHT - bad half from Castilla, who are lucky not to be down by at least one goal here. The centre of defense is incredibly shaky without Joan, he has to come on at half time if he's ready to play. Liberto, Valde and especially Aguado have severe difficulties defending Ochoa, who must be one of the fastest players in the category, but were lucky that he had a goal disallowed for offside and Fran saving the day twice. In attack, the team could've had a penalty, but apart from that, a shot from distance hitting the bar was the only real opportunity for Castilla \n\n\ud83d\udd04 46' - Arbeloa reacts with a triple sub and brings on Leiva, Lamini and Joan for Cristian David, Liberto and Valde\n\n\ud83d\udd04 63' - Rachad Fettal comes back from his lengthy injury, taking Loren's place\n\n\u26bd 70' - GOLLLLL DEL CASTILLA! - Leiva drives forwards on the counter, decides to go on the outside and finish with his left foot, but his shot hits the post - it comes back to Rachad, who takes a touch and shoots, and it is deflected over the keeper and into the net - his first Castilla goal only 7 minutes into his 2nd Castilla appearance due to his long injury\n\n79' - spectacular save by Fran! Free kick from the depths of our half for Arenteiro, and their player can head it perfectly into the bottom right corner, where Fran appears with yet another incredible save to deny the goal! The following corner leads to another good headed chance, this time it hits the bar\n\n\ud83d\udd04 81' - last sub, Pol Fortuny on for Y\u00e1\u00f1ez\n\n86' - triple chance for Castilla, first Leiva's shot is saved after he breaks free on the counter again, the rebound falls for Pol Fortuny, whose curled attempt is also saved by the keeper, and Cestero puts another rebound over the bar\n\n89' - and again Leiva is through on the counter, put though by Palacios, but again he fails to convert against the keeper\n\n\u26bd 90' - GOLLLL DEL CASTILLA - right afterwards, Castilla recover the ball early again, Fettal puts through Palacios, who does what Leiva couldn't and finishes calmly into the bottom left corner to kill off the game with his 7th league goal of the season! \n\n90'+1 - Palacios got his 5th yellow for taking off his shirt during the celebration, come on.... \n\n90'+5 - penalty reviewed for Arenteiro, but not given either\n\nFT - Arenteiro, ran out of air at the end and Castilla could see out the match with a comfortable score in a less than comfortable match - Fran saved the team on 3 occasions with extraordinary saves, and the team needed the substitutions to stabilise itself. After their 7th consecutive home win, Castilla are now 3rd, 10 points behind dominant leaders Tenerife \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 12:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid \n\n**Referee**: \n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 1, Matchday 18\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[LaLiga+](https://www.laligaplus.laliga.com/) (subscription - 14.99\u20ac/month) (only available in Spain)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-3-3): Fran Gonz\u00e1lez - Liberto Navascu\u00e9s (46' Lamini Fati), V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as (46' Joan Mart\u00ednez), Diego Aguado, Jes\u00fas Fortea - Cristian David (46' \u00c1lvaro Leiva), Jorge Cestero, Dani Mesonero - C\u00e9sar Palacios, Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga (63' Rachad Fettal), Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (81' Pol Fortuny)\n\nBench: Guille S\u00fanico (GK), Mario Rivas, Bruno Galassi, Gabri Castrelo. \n\nUnavailable: Sergio Mestre (first team call-up), Manu Serrano (injury), David Jim\u00e9nez (first team call-up), Manuel \u00c1ngel (red card suspension), Roberto Mart\u00edn (injury), Thiago Pitarch (first team call-up), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Bruno Iglesias (injury). \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** WDWDL\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 5th | 28pt | 9-1-7 | 22:21\n",

        "content": "So according to most Tier 0 sources, Madrid are most likely bringing back Nico Paz for \u00a39 million and getting either one of Kees Smit, Adam Wharton or Angelo Stiller for the role of deep lying playmaker. \n\nWill that be enough or do we need another signing? And do we need to sell anyone? Imo Ceballos has to go, maybe even Camavinga (but only if we get a really good offer) because he's somewhat injury prone.\n\nAnd the defense situation is an even bigger disaster than the midfield... Rudiger's form has taken a huge dip, Militao and Mendy perpetually injured, Carvajal still injury prone, Asencio still not ready.\n\nThis summer is crucial for the squad building.",

        "title": "Why does Real Madrid have a style of play that is so easy for Barcelona to beat?",
        "content": "As a Real Madrid fan since the 2000s, I see that Barcelona plays better, and with better tactics than Madrid. If you look at the record, the last time they scored 5 goals against Bar\u00e7a was almost 20 years ago, while it seems like they only score 5 in a match every two years. In Mourinho's era, even though we had a good tactic, it still seemed like we struggled, but we put up a fight. And every defeat Madrid suffered against Bar\u00e7a (except for the 5-0) didn't feel like a humiliation; it felt like the team had given everything, but we just couldn't pull it off. Even with Zidane, things didn't change. At La Masia, I'm sure they teach them to hate Madrid, which is why they always have a better chance of winning. It's a shame that Madrid, or at least their academy, doesn't do something similar. Maybe then we'd stop being humiliated so often. Although, the best thing would be winning the Champions League, it seems like for them, a Cl\u00e1sico is more important than the Champions League.",

        "content": "Other than how uninspiring our games have been in the past few years, how much we've relied on pure vibes and individual brilliance to win games/titles, I've just realised another reason I've been losing interest in the current crop of Madrid players....\n\n  \nEndrick.\n\nFor a long time, we didn't have a long-term solution for Benzema's successor. Then we got Endrick, signed two years(2022 to 2024) before he actually started. Two years waiting for this young talent to arrive, while relying on false #9s! I watched Palmeiras games to track his progress. In that time he made a debut for the Brazilian NT and also got handed the NT #9 shirt! \n\n  \nRough but a decent start with good goals for Madrid. I was super excited looking forward to his second season. He was even handed our #9 shirt. \n\n  \nNow where is he? Lyon.\n\nWho do we have in his place? Masty and GG. Both decent players but what's their RMA story, compared to Endrick?\n\n  \nSame with Odegaard - tracked him through many loan spells, watched him grow wonderfully, only for him to land in Arsenal. In his place? Arda, who is a brilliant player but a last-minute signing. Can't compare both players' histories on Madrid's books before their debuts.\n\nWon't be surprised if Nico Paz follows a similar arch.\n\n\nCurrent crop of players just give me meh vibes. Mishmash RMA history. Only recently started to seriously admit academy players, too. \n\n  \nI'm a case study of one obviously. But, so much fan loyalty is being flushed down the drain by this club.\n\n  \nHoping for a better turnout in 2026.",
