        "content": "I understand people are angry, especially after that terrible Cl\u00e1sico, but people need to stop talking nonsense. There's no way a manager is hired and is successful in top elite teams, winning more UCL than any other manager in history, and not know tactics.\n\nYou might not like them, you might want a Guardiola or Cholo just yelling the whole game, micromanaging the team (for real or for show), but that doesn't mean Ancelotti doesn't analyze the game.\n\nThis season, there's a clear disconnect between what's needed and what happens on the field. There are many possible reasons:\n1. the team is unbalanced after Kroos departure and the injuries, without proper signings\n2. the team is exhausted\n3. the team has no motivation after winning big last season\n4. too many players out of their natural position\n\nYes; 1, 3, and 4 are mostly the manager's fault. We know Ancelotti is stubborn, he has an idea and won't change it, especially mid-game. That's why he doesn't make subs until we're behind and why he has the team playing low block the first half, slowing down the game. But it has worked for him, so he won't change his ways.\n\nHe's totally able to change the tactical scheme, but he rarely does it during the game. He studies the rivals and makes mistakes, but this season those mistakes outweigh the good choices.\n\nThis is probably the end of his cycle, we might get Xabi Alonso, whose style is more direct and fast-paced, but that's doesn't mean he's just a grandpa Florentino P\u00e9rez hired so he is told who you play, that's simply not true. His colleagues and former players can attest to that.",

I love Kroos, and he played at a world-class level last season, but we still played shit football most of the time.\n\nIn the first half of the season, we had to rely on Bellingham turning into prime CR7 to squeeze past the likes of Celta Vigo, Getafe, Union Berlin, etc. We were bailed out by set piece goals against bottom teams like Deportivo Alaves and Mallorca. \n\nDon't get me started on our run in the CL knockout stages. We were comprehensively outplayed in every single match, apart from the 2nd leg against Bayern. Fucking RB Leipzig could have scored 8 goals against us if it wasn't for Sesko shooting like a donkey and Lunin turning into god. If Leipzig knocked us out in the RO16, all of a sudden last season looks a lot worse.\n\nNo wonder we're struggling this season. Last year we had Kroos playing like he's 20 years younger, Bellingham having one of the greatest debut seasons ever, and Vinicius putting up Ballon D'or performances, and yet we still played fugazi football most of the time, especially against big teams. The issue isn't the individual players (apart from Vasquez and Tchouameni), it's Ancelotti's non-existent tactics and an unbalanced squad ",

        "content": "3 left-wingers up front only to finish the game with Rudiger as CF when we have a 40m Euro CF on the bench whom we clearly don\u2019t rate in reality\n\nThe injury crisis is unforeseeable but Carvajal hadn\u2019t had a credible back-up in years. His injury came in the last seconds of a game where he was one of FOUR Real Madrid fullbacks (if we count Lucas) on the field?\n\n80m for Tchouameni is 80m that we might aswell have invested in a celebrity crypto coin. \n\nWe have 2 DMs that do not want to be strict, screening DMs, but cannot direct play from deep either. Our entire palate of young/new midfielders offers combined 0 control/retention or dictation of play. \n\nWe are starting 4 vertical runners every match\n\nNacho and Marin were allowed to leave despite not having Alaba back (and he was poor anyway tbh) and Militao\u2019s health being uncertain. Even Rudiger isn\u2019t getting any younger and there is no breakthrough CB unless we count Ascensio who wasn\u2019t even seem as Castilla\u2019s best CB prospect.\n\nWe like to think we are so \u201cwell ran\u201d but honestly if PSG or Chelsea was doing all this we\u2019d rightly sneer at them. This is such a poorly constructed squad. \n\nEDIT: at risk of persecution here: I don\u2019t rate Eder Militao *AT ALL* even before ACLs. His catalogue of ELGs and own-goals is EXTRAORDINARY. Like how is he getting away with this? Catastrophic defender. Another 50m we should have given to Ronaldinho\u2019s cypto coin instead. Also signing Rudiger when we have Militao means our defence will have a \u201cdouble aggressor\u201d pairing leading to dangerous step-ups/disrupted line. Again poor construction. Love Rudiger though tbh.",

Bellingham disappeared during the game, and Valverde seemed to be running around just covering for Vazquez. Camavinga was put in a difficult position because he\u2019s not someone you can rely on with the ball. \n\nI think Madrid needs to realize that we need a proper midfielder who is skilled with the ball and has great vision. I believe Odegaard could be the answer; I've been watching him since he joined Arsenal, and he has developed really well. He would fit into our team nicely. Additionally, we need a solid defensive option because Mendy is, as far as I know, out of the picture. This way, we can build our attacks from the right-back position with Alexander-Arnold.",

        "content": "Before I start, my ball knowledge is that of a fan. This is just a quick rant around how the team have been \"playing\" this season (and somewhat last season but we had Kroos). Feel free to bully this in the comments.\n\nI don't like the long balls. I just don't.\n\nReal Madrid looks clueless. Sending long balls that get intercepted and end in opposite team posession. How can you play long balls without pressing? \n\nI blame Ancelotti for not addressing this. His reliance on individual player brilliance is a little bit imbalanced and whenever these players don't perform we end up having a VERY bad game. The lack of alternative build ups, midfield ball carry structure, and quick ball recovery/pressure are very apparent vs good teams and, as of January 2025, have not been addressed.\n\nLong balls are okay, even encouraged when you have dangerous forward players (Arguably 2 best LWs in the world rn), but need to be followed with high press to recover the ball in opposition side. Instead, we send a long ball, it gets headed back by their defence....And lands in a Barca player's feet as our team is trailing back to defend lower...\n\nFlick's approach with the high line actually did fix Barcelona's defence issues for a while. If you want to play with your forwards, then go ALL IN! Win second balls and keep the pressure up. Having huge space between your target forwards and midfield/defence is just inviting teams like Barcelona to completely dominate you.\n\nI always wanted to see Real Madrid with 3 defenders high line. Stack your midfield with wide midfield players that can cover on defense, but most importantly, fight for second balls and apply pressure to the midfield. Camavinga and Valverde can both fill these roles as wide midfielders and we would have an additional opening to play in the midfield where someone like Cebaillos can be a great addition.\n\nCamavinga and Valverde both showed proffeciency in defending wide, they both played as LB/RB respectively, and did good given the circumstances. These \"expirements\" can be expanded on, I see Valverde and Camavinga as greate potential wide midfielders, combining their exquisite ball carry, vision and passing, as well as their defensive abilities. This will allow us to play more aggresively, defend higher, and generally win more balls.\n\nNow I know there is no way in hell this happens. But I would love to see Real Madrid playing with 3-4-3.\n\nLine up would look like this:\n\nCourtois\n\nTchouameni, Rudiger, Ascensio\n\nValverde, Cebaillos, bellingham, Cammavinga\n\nRodrygo, Mbappe, Vinicius\n\n  \nTl;dr: We suck at pressing. We need to press. Here is my line up to press.",

Let this goofer-offer be* PSG or Chelsea\u2019s problem. They have a sporting culture more like his.\n\nEDIT: forgot to mention recurring communication problems with Rudiger when at CB, and with Fede when in midfield. He is the common denominator.",

It is a about always wanting to achieve great things.\n\nThis is not a run of the mill club where there are low expectations. This is the biggest club in the world, with players that earn the most money and if you don't want to have standards and high expectations, why are you here? There are thousands of small to mid clubs around the world. And if you love Real Madrid for something else and want to be a Madridista for your own reason, you are welcome but please at least don't try to change our winning culture.\n\nBy the way I am not saying we should panic but who is panicking anyways? This is not panic, this is being passionate and wanting the best, expecting the best. This season, we were FAR from being the best in most major matches. We didn't even get close.\n\nLike I can't fathom my head around how some fans think of Madrid. Where is your fire to stay as the biggest and the better club? Why should Real Madrid ever be content with frequently losing or playing inferior while we have one of the best squads, resources, culture and a heritage in the world?\n\nLike how did we get into a point in this subreddit where if you want the best for Madrid, you looked upon as a weirdo or a doomer?\n\nEdit: I see misunderstandings such as \"You guys can't accept a loss\" and I want to clarify that it isn't about losing games but **how** we lost them. I am %99 sure that people wouldn't be that upset if we played better, put up a fight and still lost. Because losses can and WILL happen, that's a reality but it's how you play and show your character while losing, not going below your standards. One day offs are also okay but it shouldn't come from a systemic error. It is also not this one game and final, we haven't been putting a fight for the most major matches this season.\n\nWe are not putting high standards to our \"winning streak\", we are putting it on how we play and fight. Win or lose, that's just fate but how you win and lose, that can be concerning.\n\nWe grow from these, always do but not via turning a blind eye to how we play. Hala Madrid!",
