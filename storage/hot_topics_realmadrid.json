It clearly shows that football is still about ball control and how you use it The game reads.\n\nEven though everyone here in the sub is always talking about athletic players, yesterday we saw that players like Pedri They are superior. Because they think much faster and are more on top of things.\n\nOne should sell two of Bellingham, Valverde, Camavinga and Tchou and buy strong players instead.\n\nIt can also be seen that Arda had almost as many ball contacts in 20 minutes as Bellingham, Camavinga and Valverde. Furthermore, none of the three created any chances, while Ceballos and Arda each created a huge scoring opportunity in 20 minutes.\n\nHere too, it's clear that players who are on the ball and read the game are significantly superior.\n\nIf you want to beat big teams, you need more players like Pedri, Dejong, and Vitinha.\n\nWith athletic players, you won't achieve anything against PSG, Barca, and Arsenal.\n\nIt can be seen that Valverde, Bellongham, and Camavinga, despite their physical superiority, occupied far less space on the pitch than Pedri and Dejong. Looking at the heatmap, it's truly shocking how dominant they are.\n\nThere's no need to even discuss passing statistics when Arda and Ceballos have almost the same number of touches and create more chances in 20 minutes. If you now compare the passing statistics...Things get even worse for Real Madrid's midfielders with the addition of Pedri and Dejong.\n\nWe need two new, strong midfielders. And we need to let two go. Otherwise, we won't be able to strengthen our midfield.\n\nJust look at the statistics before the fanboys of the individual players come and insult them.",

        "content": "Losing games, finals, Clasicos, going trophyless or underperforming are all part of the game. It's normal that we can't be perfect all the time and I totally get that.\n\nWhat annoys me the most is the lack of passion our current crop of players have in most games. Recent former legends like Cristiano, Ramos, Marcelo, Casemiro etc. weren't just world class footballers, they were also living and breathing for this shirt, or at least for the sport and winning. \n\nRonaldo absolutely hated to lose with every fiber of his being. When he was missing chances he was screaming angrily and was always pushing for more. Compare that to Vini. We have lost 5 Clasicos in the last 14 months (incl. 3 finals), yet he got the most annoyed in the one we actually won, because he was subbed off earlier than usual.\n\nOur players lack mentality and... cojones. We used to have defenders running at full speed and tackling, playing while bleeding and giving their all for the team (including Rudiger). Ramos, Pepe, Varane, Casemiro, Carvajal. Now you see Huijsen as our CB, always looking non-chalant and barely going for strong challenges. A 1.90m plus defender losing aerial duels... On Gonzalo's goal (2-2), Raphinha was jumping like crazy inside his goal and \"saved\" a header that was going in. I wonder when was the last time our attackers did anything similar.\n\nAnother example of lack of passion is our finishing. Re-watching yesterday's highlights: Vini (13'), Gonzalo (32'), Rodrygo (62') and Carreras (95') all had great shooting opportunities inside the box, yet they barely put any power, resulting in a shoot that looked more like a pass towards the GK hands. Just shoot the ball with power, Raphinha scored a deflected goal because he did exactly that.\n\nWhat sucks is that I don't expect any reaction from these group of players. It's been the same since last season and they never bounce back mentally, since the \"they're looking AC Milan with anger in their eyes\" bs. I've supported this team for 20 years and I've never felt more disconnected to a RM squad, feels like they (not everyone) care more about looking cool and earning the paycheck, rather than bleeding for the badge.

        "title": "This is the worst defense I\u2019ve ever seen for Real Madrid in my life.",
        "content": "I said from day one (before the start of the season) that signing Huijsen would not be enough to solve the team\u2019s defensive problems, and that bringing in Trent Alexander-Arnold would add nothing to the squad except another name to the injury list. The Carreras signing, in my opinion, is the only one that truly solved a major issue \u2014 the left-back problem that has existed since Marcelo\u2019s final seasons with the team.\n\nBut when it comes to centre-back, I\u2019ve always stressed the importance of signing an additional top-class name alongside Huijsen. R\u00fcdiger has been delivering poor performances since last season and is now struggling physically; Milit\u00e3o is completely finished due to injuries; Alaba can no longer be relied upon and is merely adding to the numbers in the club\u2019s hospital; and Asensio is a shaky defender whose place should only be on the bench. And here we are, seeing last season\u2019s scenario repeat itself. Tchouam\u00e9ni has been forced to play as a centre-back, and we may even see Carreras or Mendy alongside him in the upcoming matches. Another season in which we end up changing players\u2019 positions just to fill this gap.\n\nAs for the right-back position, you may laugh at what I\u2019m about to say, but keeping V\u00e1zquez might have been slightly better than what we have now. Half of the season has already passed and we\u2019ve lost our first trophy \u2014 where is Carvajal? And where is the new signing, Arnold? What have we actually gained from this signing so far? At the very least, V\u00e1zquez was always available to serve the team. Many of us doubted the likelihood of this signing being a success because we were aware of the player\u2019s physical condition at Liverpool, and we all know that he is at Real Madrid only because it was a free transfer. I\u2019m not questioning the player\u2019s quality here, but what is the point of having a great player who doesn\u2019t play?\n\nAnd here an important question must be raised: if the board is not going to support the coach, why doesn\u2019t the coach turn to the academy players? What has been the role of Castilla in recent years? Alonso, and before him Ancelotti \u2014 years of changing players\u2019 positions without turning to Castilla. A midfielder playing as a centre-back, a left-back playing as a centre-back, a midfielder playing as a right-back\u2026 fine, but for how long? Why don\u2019t we take Gonzalo Garc\u00eda as an example of the potential success of Castilla players?\n\nWhere is Joan Mart\u00ednez, who was said to be a promising defender? I don\u2019t think he would be worse than Alaba. Where is David Jim\u00e9nez, who played in the cup match and stood out? Why do these players appear and then suddenly disappear? Wouldn\u2019t having a player like him at right-back yesterday have been slightly better than bringing in Arda G\u00fcler just to replace Valverde?\n\n",

We only got 2 spots left.\n\nThe board didn't buy new defenders because Alaba, Carvajal and Mendy are still here. Sure they are all UCL winning veterans but their prime has past. Alaba has past his prime for sure. Mendy can't stop getting injured but we still extended the contract. Carvajal is 34 and just suffered big injury, he obviously will continue to drop and would not be a good sub to use. We are short of RB because he and TAA are keep getting injured.\n\nActually I don't think we should have kept him this season, we should have let he and Mendy go, then buy new fullbacks.",

        "content": "Injures and missed chances is yet again the reason we lose a crucial game.\n\nThis game was correctly directed by xabi from start to finish...Everything made sense, first 15 minutes we had 2 big 1v1 chances that were stupidly missed (we love passing the ball to joan garcia), which then led to the raphinha goal.\n\nVini was very good in the first half, becuase his main aim was to attack and press tf out of kounde (which he succeeded at), but then came the second half where we missed more than 6 1v1 chances because of how reckless our finishing is. Our players have SBT syndrome (Shoot before thinking syndrome), no one sees the net when they want to shoot in tight situations, they just air it and hope for the best. We could have the most perfect build up play in years and our attackers somehow always fail to finish it, even when they're right infront of the goal\n\nOur midfield in terms of composure was shyte, but in terms of getting the ball to the final third and work rate they were actually decent. the 2 chances we missed in the first 20 minutes is the first reason why we lost this game. I really cant blame anyone rn, everyone did their job.\n\nThe subs by xabi were nothing but common sense, valverde was clearly limping a bit and was already booked, thats just what every manager with a brain would do. Vini was subbed off because he was clearly tired, he was letting way too many passes go through and was jogging while losing 3-2 instead of pressing.\n\nFinal review: Solid game in terms of work rate (especially jude and cama), but i must repeat, the chances missed has really let us down again, In the first 20 minutes and the last ones, all of those chances ended up in a state where our player passes the ball to joan garcia, and it happened 3 times in the last 2 minuts alone. And i repeat injuries is the MAIN reason why we lost today, xabi orchestrated the perfect plan with the little options he had. And the missed chances were just the chillies on top.\n\nPS: Our defense has been shit for almost 3 years now, there is no point of me writing the same sh\\*t after every game, just act like i crashed out about it again.",
