        "title": "People never really think things through when asking why the club does not make moves in the Winter transfer",
        "content": "I'm gonna try to make this as simple as possible by changing the perspective one second and considering the combinations between these 2 elements :\n\n\\- Title contender vs Mid Table (or below) teams\n\n\\- Key starters vs bench (or rotation) players\n\n**Scenario 1:  We want to loan a key starter from a title contender team**\n\nNow why dafuq would any team in their right mind give up any key player while playing for trophies. That's never gonna happen. So we can already forget that.\n\n**Scenario 2:  We want to loan a bench player from a title contender team**\n\nOkay, yes these may be players that they can dispose of, but why would they want to help you strengthen your squad if they're likely competing against you (domestically or continentally).\n\n**Scenario 3:  We want to loan a key starter from a mid table team**\n\nAlso not gonna happen. Think about it, why would I loan you a guy who's having a stellar season for me and is helping my club finish higher in the league tables than usual (thus securing more revenue) right in the middle of the season ? Also, this player who's an X-factor for me, probably will get less minutes at your club (Real Madrid), which will kill his momentum and hype. So once he gets back from loan, his resell value will have taken a massive hit.\n\n*Imagine if Jovic went on loan in January 6 months before we bought him. He would have been exposed, and no way any sane club would pay the 80M we paid.*\n\nSo no, again, these types of players don't get loaned. If you want them, you're gonna pay a nice premium like City just did for Marmoush, cause Frankfurt's performance won't be the same going forward and they made sure City paid upfront for the upcoming $$ losses.\n\n**Scenario 4:  We want to loan a bench player from a mid table team**\n\nNow why the hell would we do that. Unless we want to end up with Mariano and Vallejo 2.0.\n\n\n\nSo you see where I'm trying to go here. \n\nHowever, there is one final scenario not mentioned, but the stars have to align.\n\n**Scenario 5:  A key starter from a title contender team falling off with the current coach and forces a move**\n\nThis is the only time when a club like Real Madrid could actually consider a loan move. Cause the player in cases like this did not become shit, he just did not fit the manager's plans/system anymore. But the player is still serviceable. And in situations like this, the loan actually makes everyone happy. The manager no longer has locker room drama, the players gets playtime, the new club gets a player who can help them. And bonus, once the players comes back from loan, his value didn't tank, cause he actually showed his quality at the club he was loaned to, unlike if he had stayed at his original club and rot on the bench. But again, the stars have to align for such players to be available when you need them.\n\nUltimately, the football world is not just Real Madrid being the main protagonist and everyone else being some retarded NPC. Teams have ambitions too. It does not have to be as high as ours, but they  have goals nonetheless, and they won't shoot themselves in the foot cause Real Madrid came knocking on the door, regardless of their status. So if you really want their player that bad, you gonna have to pay up. Which won't happen since Flo is not an idiot and we're not backed by PL and oil money.",

Players like Asensio, Nico Paz, Ramon and many others have been in our Youth team for years. The integration should have started years ago, players like Ramon and Asensio should have been given solid minutes last year so that they have been ready to start this year.\n\nWe honestly wasted years of youth squad integration because Carlo only likes to play his fav. 14-15 players.\n\nThe players are there, our Youth System is as strong as ANY other team.\n\nI hate to say it but look at Barcelona, They have created gems out of their youth. couple of years ago even their most loyal fan did not know half of these starting players are. Look at them now, almsot their entire team is from their Youth Squad. Yamal, Cubarasi, Balde, Pedri, Gavi...etc.\n\n\\------------------------------------------\n\nSolution to long term injuries should ALWAYS be from the Youth System, It is Ancelloti's failure to not integrate our youth team.\n\nTop players like Militao, Alaba, Rudiger are still on the club's payroll. Expecting to sign a worldclass CB on a long contract is not realistic. \n\nAsensio has shown he can be a Main team material, we probably have couple of more players like that.\n\nOur youth players have been scouted by the very best, they deserve a chance. It is crazy that a player like Fortea forces himself to leave the club cuz he knows he wont get a chance here.",

Our Team is young and FULL of world class potential and except a few positions we are set for a solid Decade!\n\nThis season has been terrible by Real standards but still we\u2019re 1st in the league and are alive in the CDR and somehow surviving in the UCL. \n\nJust reminding when Real has its back against the wall, they find a way to dig themselves out of the hole. \n\nAs a fan, I might be sad, angry or elated depending on the situation of each match day. But I know full well that I can relax \ud83d\ude0c knowing that we, Real Madrid will give it our everything and even if we go down, it won\u2019t be without putting up a fight. \n\nHalamadrid \ud83d\udc9f",

        "content": "Full transcript: \n\nCristiano Ronaldo: \n\u201cAt Real Madrid, for example, I remember when I missed a chance or a penalty I would be so angry with myself. I didn't allow myself to make mistakes. I would go to bed without dinner, and talk to myself, wondering why I shot to the right or to the left. I don't regret being like that.\n\nEverything that happens on the field, stays on the field. I can't get home with my football problems with my family. But at first it was very difficult. I missed an opportunity or penalty and I locked myself in my room and talked to myself. I was sick.\n\nMbapp\u00e9 is fast, powerful, he has speed\u2026 He can\u2019t wait in the box. He has to stay out and appear. If I did it, can\u2019t Mbapp\u00e9 do it? Real Madrid have to protect him.\n\nVin\u00edcius should have won the Ballon d'Or, but I'm not surprised, there is no credibility, I was very disappointed, he deserved it.\n\nJude Bellingham reminds me a lot of Zidane, he has some Zidane elements. He will give a lot to Madrid, because he will be a star.\n\nI like the fact that Real Madrid fans miss me. My home is Spain, I played for Madrid for many years, it was where I was happiest. Real Madrid was always in my heart.\n\nMy son Mateo really likes Bellingham, Camavinga, Mbapp\u00e9.\n\nI achieved beautiful things at Madrid and people don\u2019t forget that, that makes me happy.\n\nI respect Perez, he is a trustworthy president and a serious person, and he treated me well. We won many titles with him, and I respect him a lot.\n\nI loved playing in the Camp Nou. They booed me, they insulted me, and I LOVED that.\n\nYou may prefer Pele, Messi, Maradona, I understand and respect that.\n\nI have a very good relationship with Messi, I was his translator at some awards ceremonies.\n\nAt one point I was at Sporting and I managed to go to Barcelona, \u200b\u200bthey wanted to sign me.\u201d\n\nIt didn't happen, because they wanted to sign me the following year and United came and signed me.\n\nI enjoyed scoring goals more at the Camp Nou than at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u. When you are warming up and they are already whistling at you, that\u2019s what I love. That\u2019s the best part of football for me.\u201d\n\nMadrid - Barcelona atmosphere and the relationship with Messi?\n\nCristiano Ronaldo:\n\n\u201cIt was a historic rivalry, Madrid-Barcelona, \u200b\u200bCristiano-Messi, Ramos-Pique.\n\nIt was very nice I had a very good relationship with Messi and I once translated it into some awards and all that before the ceremony started He has always treated me well and I hope we see our numbers again, but I find it very difficult\u201d\n\n\u201cI appreciate and respect Florentino, I speak to him sometimes and I don't rule out coming back one day when I finish my career and do something great.\u201d\n\n\u201cI left Real Madrid because I wanted a new chapter.\n\nIn the negotiations phase when I was leaving Real Madrid, Florentino did not behave well with me. I understood that, because that is always his style.\n\nI told Perez about it, he accepted, but later he tried to come back, and there was no going back for me, because I had given my word to Juventus.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm happy people still remember that I did important and beautiful things and that's why people don't forget when you leave a mark.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpain is my homeland, my children were born there, and I will always have Real Madrid in my heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really like Carlo Ancelotti, he is an amazing person, we have won a lot of things together.\u201d\n",
