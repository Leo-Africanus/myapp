This leaves Rodrygo, Brahim, Ceballos, and Mendy's future up in the air.\n\nI think by next season, we might see this as our main A and B teams. I can't lie, this is some generational lifetime squad building. If these talents/players achieve their true potential, you're looking at another dynastical run.\n\nVery excited for what the future has to hold for the club and the best part is that all of this will be done on 0 net debt while still cashing in 200M worth of inflow every season from organic revenues.\n\nWe can cement the club to the greatest peak a sporting entity can ever accomplish if things go according to the plan.\n\nThoughts?",

        "content": "We were on the verge of signing Carreras and then they changed their minds last minute to register him for the cup. It was obvious that Carreras was expecting to join us before the tournament started and it didn\u2019t sit well with him at all because the first two games he played, you can clearly see that he didn\u2019t want to play for them anymore. I can understand why would back out last minute because he\u2019s one of their best players this season and you wouldn\u2019t want to go in to a tournament without your best guys. What confuses me, is the fact he didn\u2019t play a single minute today knowing that this was a must win match and you need your best starting eleven. This just seems like pettiness me honestly; and if that\u2019s the case why didn\u2019t you let him come to us in the first place. What do you guys think",

As the game ended my friend and I decided to wait out the traffic and see how long it would take for us to get ushered out. When we eventually were escorted to the concourse, my friend saw one of the drummers who was just standing there. So he picks up the stick and I start recording and singing\u2014 we ended up creating a whole protest-like mob that walked out of the stadium together lol. \n\nPS: yes that was me that messed up como no te voy a querer in the beginning I promise I know it I had just been up since 4am that day and got confused for a sec \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

Now I look at what\u2019s happened in the last year and it\u2019s hard not to shake my head.\n\nTigrinho hasn\u2019t delivered at Bar\u00e7a and his numbers at Betis and Palmeiras aren\u2019t doing him any favors. I\u2019m not saying Endrick has been world-class either but at least he\u2019s shown up in big games and looks like he belongs.\n\nPeople were acting like Roque was the new Tevez and Endrick was just hype. But one of them just played a full season at Real Madrid and earned Brazil call-ups. The other is back in Brazil struggling to find form.\n\nStats don\u2019t tell the whole story but they do help. I\u2019ll drop a side-by-side in the comments for anyone interested.",
