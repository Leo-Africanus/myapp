        "content": "I know there's basically nothing we can do about it but I just have to get this off my chest. Modric is still one of the best midfielders in the world at 39 years old. One of the common criticisms people make against him is that he doesn't have much stamina anymore but I think that's the opposite of the truth. When you look at the games where he started and played for the full 90 this season he didn't even really look that gassed and he's still always running up and down the field, of course he's had a few average performances but that doesn't change the fact that he has the most big chances created on the team. There are literally moments where he outpaces people that are like 10 years younger than him to make it back to the defense like today when he saved us twice\ud83d\ude2d, and players like guler could still learn a lot from him so I think it's really sad to see him go right now.",

The players are clearly not at their best because it's a transition period - there is clear confusion amongst the players as the playstyle of Ancelotti and Xabi is drastically different, and even Man City suffered in the start under Pep Guardiola, and so did Allegri with Juventus. Good things take time and I believe Xabi's the man. Let's hope with Mbappe back we'll be stronger. ",

        "content": "I bought tickets to go to the game with my grandfather. He is a huge fan and had never seen the team play in person and he is 91. I drove to Orlando (3.5h one way) the day before to get him. Bought parking ($50) to be sure I didn\u2019t have to be looking last minute and waste time. \n\nArrived 1.5 hour earlier cause I knew there would be traffic no matter what - and there was. There was no way to ask for information and I would be moving a car length every 3 -4 minutes. I kept looking at the  parking lots for mine and I kept passing by lot 18-17-16-15 and suddenly there was no 14. Still at the same moving rate. I saw someone directing traffic and told me to turn around and it would be on my left. And well when I did the lot was closed as all of the same colored ones were. After moving that slow I found someone else and told me to go to lot 6 which took at least 20 minutes to get there from where I was. The game had already started at that point. My grandfather wasn\u2019t feeling too well either. After I got to lot 6.. it was closed. Parking was full everywhere. I asked the next person I saw and told me to do a U turn and it would be on my right (BS I just came from there and everything was closed) I then decided to find parking on my own in another plaza which were all full and you could see tow trucks left and right. After an extra 10 minute I found parking (free btw). \n\nThe it was a 20 minute walk to the stadium gate under 92 f sun. Finally arrived to the gate the game was in around minute 67. Finally walking in I was told I couldn\u2019t walk in with my small bag (that I had brought and was let in without problems for the Inter Miami - Al Ahly game on Saturday) so they made me lay 18 to put it in a locker room for basically the 20min left of the game. My grandfather wasn\u2019t feeling well and almost fainted, I had to hold him. The heat, the stress, no being able to have water for so long. Someone came to help but he said he doesn\u2019t need help, he\u2019ll brave through it to watch as much time as he could. Until we got to the seats. It was about minute 74. Got there to watch Valverde miss a penalty and at least we watched Modric go in (his favorite player) and hear the stadium chant his name. \n\nBesides that, nightmare and piss job from hard rock stadium. Made me miss the whole game, my grandpa faint and made me pay extra for shit because they felt like it. Oh it also took us 2 hours to get out of the parking because Miami drivers and traffic officers and organizers are ass. That was my experience today. $485 gone to waste with extra unpleasantness. FUCK Hard Rock Stadium. ",

        "content": "* Carlo Ancelotti was THE coach to bring us the 10th UCL title that we chased for 12 years\n\n\n* Carlo was THE first coach to win us a double (UCL + La Liga or Copa Del Rey) after 1958 and he did it THREE TIMES (2014, 2022 and 2024).\n\n\n* Carlo was THE FIRST Real Madrid coach to score 4 goals at Camp Nou since 1963. AND he was the first one to beat Barca by 4 goals since 1995.\n\n\n* His team scored 4 goals at Allianz Arena against Pep's Bayern and 5 goals at Anfield against Klopp's Liverpool (Liverpool who we had never beaten in our history before Carlo mind you), you need to go back to 50's and 60's to see Real Madrid achieve such scorelines against best teams in europe. And we had NEVER won at Allianz in our HISTORY when he won 4:0 against Pep there.\n\n\n* Pep Guardiola, our literal worst nightmare, has faced us almost 30 times and only lost 3 matches by 2 or more goals, ALL 3 TIMES it was Carlo's Real Madrid.\n\n\n* Carlo's Real Madrid faced Pep 5 times in the UCL and eliminated him 4 out of those 5 while being considered underdogs in most of those ties which is an insane achievment\n\n\n* We like to pride ourselves with being a team who always comes back, but out of 8 Comebacks that Real Madrid has completed in the UCL era (since 1992) 5 have come under Ancelotti. HE is the comeback king.\n\n\nThere are many many more examples of things that Real Madrid didnt achieve before Carlo and that no other team has achieved but Carlo's Real did.\n\n\nI understand that we lost virtually all important games this season (bar Man City and Atletico) and that he had to go, im also really excited for Xabi's reign which starts today, but to see some fans talk about Carlo like he wasn't an absolute GOAT for us and the most dominant coach in europe in our history is insane. we all need to put a lot of respect on his name",

        "content": "There's is some good and quite a few bad \nI'll start with good.\n\n1. We saw the first offside goal I've seen in a while for us (has implications)\n\n2 . (Linked to point 1 ) We saw a more higher line and better communication across the backline for at least the first half .\n\n3 . In the first half we so almost an equal amount of play on the right wing and left wing Trent was making the right side look dangerous again.\n\n4 . Huijsen is a baller and was definitely a W signing.\n\n5 . Gonzalo Garcia not that but his heading abilities is clearly on track and could be the joselu we lost.\n\n\nNow for the bads and I can tell you there's no shortage.\n\n1.we were outnumbered in midfield we have this idea of passing the ball to winger they pas back then pass to defence then pass to midfield who is going to pass to the winger on the other side, that's just premium time wasting nothing is happening, \n\nMy idea \ud83d\udca1 to improve is that : \nwe need to go through the middle somehow , I think opponent midfielder should be all marked \nAnd possibly outnumbered.\n\n2 . I don't like Lucas Vasquez came on . Trent is better and I know Xabi my want to get everything out of Lucas before he leaves but not a game like this.\n\n3 . We should just stop using wingers in general \nVini and Rodrygo are too close to the edge of the pitch far away from the team waiting for the ball normally that would stretch opponent defence but it isn't working,\n\nMy \ud83d\udca1 idea :\nthey need to be moving , rotating making it more unpredictable for opponents. they  need to sneak behind defence more often and not force themselves into having to make difficult dribbles.\n\n4. I'll end it quick but why was Rodrygo subbed off first he arguably played better plus he has trained with Xabi the most and would probably understand he's tactics better, and no hate on Vini they both didn't play well but I'd say Vini was worse \nMy idea \ud83d\udca1: \nXabi could have tried Rodrygo on the left wing to see how he performs .\n\n5 . We need more forward passes and we should get to the final third faster we have the quality.\n\n6 . Lastly Mbappe i hate you bro \ud83d\ude2d \ud83d\ude2d \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94 why ditch us like this . you could have made good use of Trent sill set and shut the haters but that's fine get better soon .\n\n                              HALA  MADRID !!!",

It was obviously a very frustrating match, but what were the positives you\u2019re happy about and the negatives that need to be fixed soon?\n\n\n\nAlso, how did you rate the individual player performances? Who do you think needs to improve their game moving forward, and who stood out in a positive way? Are there any players you believe should be benched based on today\u2019s performance, or others who have earned a place in the starting lineup? And considering the weaknesses we saw in this match, which position should be our priority for the next signing, and do you have any specific players in mind?\"\n",
