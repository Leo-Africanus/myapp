No one is happy with the current happenings at the club with regard to the recent losses, sacking of Xabi, effort from some players, etc. I want to remind this sub of our rule to use the open thread (OT) for these posts. The purpose of the OT is to have these discussions, and allows for the home page to stay relatively clean. Sometimes we will keep posts up that have 'gained enough traction' (i.e., enough comments, upvotes) but we will be removing posts that do not fit the home page no matter what at this time. Thank you.",

        "content": " I\u2019ve been following Real Madrid for almost 20 years, and these divas who think they\u2019re superstars should thank Florentino P\u00e9rez every single morning for banning the Ultras Sur.\nI\u2019ve seen Casillas get booed for poor performances. I saw Mourinho bench him, and he left like any other player. I saw Kak\u00e1 a legend at Milan sit on the bench quietly, without drama or public complaints.\n\nI watched Cristiano Ronaldo, \u00d6zil, Sergio Ramos, Xabi Alonso, Di Mar\u00eda, Benzema give everything for this club. I saw Benzema benched for Higua\u00edn. I saw Marcelo lose his place. I saw Gareth Bale lose his place. And you know what? None of them gave interviews attacking the coach. None of them acted bigger than the club.\n\n\nI\u2019m not talking only about Vin\u00edcius Jr, no no, I\u2019m talking about all those players who step into the pitch just to show off, constantly demanding privileges and questioning the coach publicly.\nI\u2019m not here to defend Xabi Alonso, Ancelotti, or anyone else. I\u2019m here for the club. For REAL MADRID.\n\nThis is not Ibiza Beach FC. This is Real Madrid. Even when we lost, rivals respected us because of who we were. I remember when the Bernab\u00e9u erupted just by seeing the players walk onto the pitch because they transmitted hunger, intensity, and pride.\nNow we\u2019re forced to watch players with egos bigger than Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s, but with the level of Lucas V\u00e1zquez with all due respect to him. These players don\u2019t feel what we feel.\n\nAfter a bad match, they board planes, return to their mansions, sleep with supermodels, and wake up worried only about which Lamborghini, BMW, or Ferrari to drive to training. They want to win without running, without fighting, because they believe they\u2019re untouchable.\nThey don\u2019t respect the fans.\n\nAnd here\u2019s a message for those who started \u201csupporting\u201d Real Madrid in 2018, 2019, or especially in 2022: this club did not start with Valverde, Vin\u00edcius, Courtois, Hazard, or anyone else.\nStop blindly defending players at all costs. Cristiano Ronaldo left this club for much less, after giving us years of joy and historic performances and even he didn\u2019t get special treatment on the way out.\n\nDo you honestly believe anyone in this current squad has done even 30% of what CR7, Marcelo, Ramos, or Benzema did? Of course not.\nSo stop defending laziness. At Real Madrid, effort is non-negotiable. Some players deserve to be booed loudly until they understand the weight of this shirt and some need to be booed to the point of asking to be substituted.\nThis is REAL MADRID.\n\nI have much more to say, but that\u2019s for another time.\nThank you to everyone who read this far.",

        "content": "The club's management believes the defeat is historic and will demand an extra effort from the players to fight for the two remaining titles. Changes are expected for next season.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReal Madrid lost to Albacete in the Copa del Rey round of 16 on Wednesday. \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa 's tenure began in the worst possible way with a heavy defeat in the final minute and further doubts surrounding the team. They have lost two titles in just three days, and on Saturday they host Levante at the Bernab\u00e9u with the fans on edge and a chorus of boos hanging over them in the lead-up to the match.\n\nWhat does the club say after the elimination?\nAccording to Melchor Ruiz, there is great displeasure at Real Madrid because they consider the defeat against Albacete historic , on par with those against Alcorc\u00f3n or Alcoyano, also in the Copa del Rey. They believe the performance at the Carlos Belmonte stadium was unbecoming of a club like Real Madrid. Furthermore, they see the players as primarily responsible for the club's current situation. They feel that the Albacete defeat marked the lowest point, and they are convinced that they must make important decisions for next season, some of which could be surprising. They now hope that Arbeloa, in whom they have complete confidence , will be able to turn things around and fight for the two remaining titles: La Liga and the Champions League. However, no signings will be made in the winter transfer window.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArancha Rodr\u00edguez added that Real Madrid were clear that a change of direction was needed , which is why Xabi Alonso was sacked. The defeat is painful, but Arbeloa will be judged on his performance in the upcoming matches, not on the Albacete game, as he had only been at the club for a day. There is indeed concern about the players' fitness, and it is believed that the team will improve once this issue is addressed. The belief is that they can compete for La Liga and the Champions League , and that most of the players are underperforming, with the exception of Courtois and Mbapp\u00e9.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAt Real Madrid , the players, including Arbeloa, will be asked to make an extra effort for this final stretch. This will happen before the match against Levante, and one of the club's senior figures will be in charge. They will be told that the situation is critical and that from now on they must give 100%. They know they are being targeted on social media , and a chorus of boos is expected. This is the angriest moment for Real Madrid fans in recent years.",

        "content": "Been following this team for 30 years and honestly I have never seen a meltdown like this. Its kind of amazing to watch. Feels like a mix of gold-diggers and fans who only started following Real Madrid because of a certain player. They have no idea what a real rough patch feels like.\n\nLet me tell you something, what we are seeing now is nothing compared to what real fans have gone through.\n\nThink early 2000s. Galacticos everywhere. Figo, Zidane, Ronaldo, Beckham. Everyone expected trophies every season. And yet we had some brutal heartbreaks. Losing the 2002 Champions League semi-final on penalties to Bayern. 2003 La Liga slipping at the worst possible moment. 2005 losing the Champions League quarter-final to Juventus after dominating the league. Fans endured it. We survived it.\n\nMid to late 2000s. The round of 16 curse in the Champions League became a nightmare. Year after year we got knocked out early by Lyon, Roma, Bayern, Liverpool. Champions League expectations were sky-high, but the team kept hitting the wall. La Liga wasnt easy either. We dominated most of the season only to have Barcelona snatch it at the end multiple times. Fans went through heartbreaks, outrage, and frustration. We learned patience the hard way.\n\nEven the first few years after the Galacticos era were rough. Coaching changes every season, big-money signings failing to deliver, rival clubs laughing at us. Every setback felt personal. And still, the true Madridistas stuck with the team.\n\nThen 2013-14. Finally, after years of suffering through that round of 16 curse, we lifted La Decima. Pure relief, pure joy. Everything before that heartbreak suddenly made sense. That\u2019s what it feels like to survive the tough times.\n\nNow, I see a lot of people calling for Perez to resign. Really? Look at where Real Madrid was before him and where he took the club. Do not forget what he has achieved. The man built one of the greatest clubs in the world over and over. La Decima, La Undecima, multiple Champions Leagues, dominating Europe for decades. Criticize all you want, but calling for him to leave in a rough patch shows how little some people know or remember what this club went through before he arrived.\n\nAnd another thing. Stop comparing Real Madrid to Manchester United. Like really? Are you joking? Look at the last decade. United have struggled in PL and Champions League. Real Madrid have won 5 Champions Leagues in 9 years under Zidane and beyond. Winning La Liga, dominate in Europe. Revenue? Brand? Squad depth? History? Real Madrid is in a different league. You cannot compare the two, and anyone saying otherwise clearly does not understand football.\n\nSo yes, the situation is messy. Fans are upset. But relax, this chaos is nothing new. The real test of being a Madridista isnt celebrating wins, its surviving the tough times. And we have done it before, we will do it again, and we will laugh at these meltdowns.",

        "content": "Look, I\u2019m not just talking for drama, there\u2019s legitimate reasons why the atmosphere should be tense this weekend.\n\nWe just got knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Albacete, a second-division side, in one of the most humiliating results in recent history. That was Arbeloa\u2019s debut as coach and it wasn\u2019t even close to respectable.\n\nXabi Alonso is gone after only seven months,a manager who was supposed to be the next big thing, and we\u2019re already in managerial chaos.\n\nMeanwhile the fans inside the club are already openly questioning Florentino. On Reddit threads today people are demanding Perez step down, calling his decisions ego-driven and disconnected from what this team actually needs.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget the wider fallout:  \n\u2022 The squad looks completely lost on the pitch, no identity, no consistency, even longtime supporters are calling this a meltdown unlike anything they\u2019ve seen.  \n\u2022 There\u2019s tension over plans to potentially open up ownership structures and bring in outside investment, something a lot of socios aren\u2019t happy about.  \n\u2022 Florentino\u2019s constant attacks on refereeing and the whole Negreira saga have drawn public pushback from the Spanish referees\u2019 association.\n\nSo yeah, if the Bernab\u00e9u doesn\u2019t let them hear it with whistles and boos this Saturday, I\u2019ll be genuinely surprised.\n\nLet\u2019s see if these people inside the club actually feel the pressure they\u2019ve created.",
