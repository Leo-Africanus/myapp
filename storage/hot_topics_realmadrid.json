Any recommendations or any season ticket holders here who want to help us out in some way? We already got tickets for Real Madrid's basketball game on Sunday but this would be the highlight of the trip. \n\nThank you all in advance!\n\nUPDATE: We started to get separate tickets around the stadium. 4/6 have tickets now and 2 remaining want to try and get seated together. \n\nMy experience is that entradas.es was way way better than Real Madrid\u2019s own site. That own site is a burning pile of garbage!",

        "content": "Hi\n\nI'm planning on attending the last game of the season at Bernabeu vs Real Sociedad and I would need some information regarding my trip there.\n\nFrom what I've seen, tickets are available to purchase (usually) 7-14 days before the match. Since I need to plan my trip and book place to stay as well as plane ticket, that's kind of late for me.\n\nShould I be worried about tickets availability? From what I've read, only reliable ticket providers are RM official webpage and in front of stadium, right?\n\nI'll be staying in Madrid for the weekend and I'm planning tour on stadium day before the game, probably going back home on Monday, so if you have any any other advice, what to visit, where to go, what to see, can you share with me?\n\nThanks a lot",
