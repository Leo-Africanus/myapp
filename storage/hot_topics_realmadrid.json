All of us would be more frustrated and less forgiving with his behavior. \n\nAlso now some opponents will purposefully try to rile him up as they know it is easy to get reaction out of him. not to say they are not doing it currently.\n\n  \nAs fans we need to held him accountable that might give him necessary incentive to change\n\nHe can show dissent but he has to do it following the rules. He can't go on tantrum run. He to has to follow appropriate channels.",

It is going to be in the Bernabeu stadium, so that is a plus. Since this is at the end of our trip, I dont know if I'll have enough money left to buy tickets for all 3 of us, so he will probably he going alone.  \nAlso, I got him the Madridista card as you suggested, thank you for that idea! Is this match a very popular one or is it sort of safe to assume I'll be able to get a ticket if I keep checking the site?  \nThanks! I really feel like this community is helping to make this happen!  \n ",

They are the same people saying Vinicius shouldn't feel like the world is against him. But they feel more than comfortable trashing him for things he does on and off the pitch.\n\nWhat should he have done?\n\nWait to win the ballon d'or - and then start planning celebration parties? Anyway!",

Everything is looking bad for us, we're playing like sh*t... And then we win!!! \n\nGosh this must hurt.. and I want them to be hurt \ud83d\ude0d\n\nAnd the cherry on top was that shot they missed in the last seconds. Even the ball wanted justice for Vini \ud83e\udd70\n\nHonestly I would cry if I was a Valencia fan. But anyways, good luck to every single team that will play against them this season.. including Barca and Atletico \ud83d\ude07 let these jerks go down!!!",
