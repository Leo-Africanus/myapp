This unique event took place on June 4, 1980, at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium in Madrid. Real Madrid won the match 6\u20131, securing their 14th Copa del Rey title.     \n\n([1979\u201380 Copa del Rey - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979%E2%80%9380_Copa_del_Rey?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n\nCastilla's journey to the final was remarkable, as they defeated several top-tier teams, including Athletic Bilbao, Real Sociedad, and Sporting de Gij\u00f3n.

        "content": "\\- Real Madrid TV publishes a video exposing De Burgos Bengoetxea, you can watch it here: [https://youtu.be/U0SYi12QOvU](https://youtu.be/U0SYi12QOvU)\n\n\\- Pablo Gonz\u00e1lez Fuertes  and De Burgos Bengoetxea (VAR referee + main referee for tomorrow) go on a press conference today. Gonz\u00e1lez Fuertes announces stricter measures and actions in the coming weeks regarding the RMTV video and all that is happening, while he wants a \"healthier\" football in general.\n\nWith a question from the press (who are the culprit of the other 50% of this corrupt circus) that goes directly to make controversy (\"Do you think these videos make children not want to be referees in the future?\") De Burgos Bengoetxea takes the word and answers \"Yeah the RMTV videos have repercussion and some other referee colleagues told me: \"Some of their kids go to school and return crying because other kids said \"your father is a thief\" and then starts crying, while says he's honest and wants to teach to their children that.\n\n\\- The show has been made, some crocodile tears there, some threats from the CTA here, so expect tomorrow one of the most awful matches you've seen in football (if you didn't have enough this year like the Osasuna one).\n\n\\- De Burgos Bengoetxea has 64% win rate with Real Madrid. 81% with Barcelona.\n\n\\- Remember that Iturralde Gonz\u00e1lez (referee with most appearances in LaLiga history) said that on a video (I subbed it on English) said this about the CTA decision to put Pablo and De Burgos: [https://streamable.com/idho4y](https://streamable.com/idho4y)\n\n\\- Remember the comparison from UEFA vs Spanish CTA referees:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mziog6ewnzwe1.png?width=502&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec0e432655dcffdc305fdb6b5e09502ef4773531\n\nSo that's it, that's LaLiga Negreira for you. A show of comedy, demagogy, prevarication, corruption and rigged matches.\n\nWe should not go out tomorrow and put Castilla for the remaining LaLiga matches, but of course we don't have enough balls to do that.\n\nOf course this sub will downvote this thread a lot and say that RMTV are clowns for doing that, but of course you're international fans and don't understand what is really happening here. You only keep the surface of things, and can't be analytical for anything as shown in other threads, lol.\n\nIt's like you only watch the tv shows and documentaries out there and believe everything is real, like Drive to Survive of Formula 1.\n\ntl;dr this happened today\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xgfnzwsu50xe1.png?width=1214&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e05b0e0fd893d1814c14df01e84b1614d75873d\n\nEdit: and please, don't believe the press as they turn everything to \"El Madrid\" or \"Madrid is wrong\" and with super dramatic headers. The club didn't talk in any official way yet:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/04tuegk4xzwe1.png?width=764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bee183b1512d3086627526e8cfe17ce1ac8c70c9\n\nEdit 2: seems we have serious people at the club so we are starting to make some things already:\n\nNo dinner, no press conference from players, no training!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/suh9h2d9l0xe1.png?width=664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5a4f026db7ab19d74800e0a4bd0b310f9da4815\n\n",

I was hoping to be able to catch a game but unfortunately the times didn\u2019t line up the best. But fortunately for me, the copa del Rey final will be on and at least I can watch it. I was wondering if there would be a good place to watch it, I know as it being el Classico almost everyone will be watching it, but I was hoping to watch it and get as close to an authentic viewing experience that I can. Any good recommendations for fun football bars that will have a fun atmosphere??\n\nSecondly, even thought I\u2019m not a Real Madrid fan I would still love to visit the bernebeu and experience such a historical place. I know there are tours available, but I see that there is construction going on. Does that significantly hamper on the experience? I\u2019m excited to do the tour and see the museum as well. Any recommendations to get the true experience?\n\nThank you all in advance, and if it\u2019s any help I absolutely despise Barcelona so I\u2019ll be rooting for Real Madrid this final!!!!",
