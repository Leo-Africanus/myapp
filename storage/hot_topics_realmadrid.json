AND he was the first one to beat Barca by 4 goals since 1995.\n\n\n* His team scored 4 goals at Allianz Arena against Pep's Bayern and 5 goals at Anfield against Klopp's Liverpool (Liverpool who we had never beaten in our history before Carlo mind you), you need to go back to 50's and 60's to see Real Madrid achieve such scorelines against best teams in europe. And we had NEVER won at Allianz in our HISTORY when he won 4:0 against Pep there.\n\n\n* Pep Guardiola, our literal worst nightmare, has faced us almost 30 times and only lost 3 matches by 2 or more goals, ALL 3 TIMES it was Carlo's Real Madrid.\n\n\n* Carlo's Real Madrid faced Pep 5 times in the UCL and eliminated him 4 out of those 5 while being considered underdogs in most of those ties which is an insane achievment\n\n\n* We like to pride ourselves with being a team who always comes back, but out of 8 Comebacks that Real Madrid has completed in the UCL era (since 1992) 5 have come under Ancelotti. HE is the comeback king.\n\n\nThere are many many more examples of things that Real Madrid didnt achieve before Carlo and that no other team has achieved but Carlo's Real did.\n\n\nI understand that we lost virtually all important games this season (bar Man City and Atletico) and that he had to go, im also really excited for Xabi's reign which starts today, but to see some fans talk about Carlo like he wasn't an absolute GOAT for us and the most dominant coach in europe in our history is insane. we all need to put a lot of respect on his name",

Ultimately good, but speaks to where Rodrygo\u2019s head was during the end of the season.\n\nQuestion from reporter: Have you talked to Rodrygo and have you expressed what you want from him  given what happened towards the end of the year with Carlo?\n\nXabi responded: \u201cI can tell you what we discussed to a certain extent. I know what happened and I know the end of the season was not easy for him. But in the end, he took time for himself that was good for him. He didn\u2019t play for Brazil and he was able to reset his head.\n\nWe spoke the first day and I see him with energy and effort. I see him enjoying himself on the pitch and overall. He has great quality, and discussed all the good he can do. We spoke, we shared ideas and now we have to put it into practice.\u201d\n\nConclusion: Xabi is optimistic about the future with Rodrygo but it\u2019s unfortunate that Rodrygo did struggle from team dynamics and his respective role. Concerned that he cracked under the pressure/circumstances.",

Seeing his full support and love here makes me really think he trained and supported Arda so well.\n\nFootball is a sport that is beyond shooting, passing, goals and assists.\n\nThese two went through so many hardships during their childhood; Arda saw poverty just like Luka when he was facing hardship during a war-flee. The connection and bond through this sport will last forever and I truly hope Arda carries the legacy.\n\nApologies for the long body, however, the love here just seemed way too authentic and has me \ud83e\udd79.",

        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/bx5vhvy4ui7f1.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96bf96628daa405fc691f68366682ed48eef5f3c\n\n[https://www.realmadrid.com/en-US/news/club/announcements/comunicado-oficial-16-06-2025](https://www.realmadrid.com/en-US/news/club/announcements/comunicado-oficial-16-06-2025)\n\nOFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT. 16/06/2025\n\nReal Madrid C.F. wishes to announce that the 23rd Section of the Provincial Court of Madrid has today issued a guilty verdict against the four radical fans who, in the early hours of the morning of 25 to 26 January 2023, hours before the quarter final match of the Copa del Rey between Real Madrid C.F. and Club Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, S.A.D., hung a black inflatable doll from a bridge in the vicinity of Real Madrid City, simulating his hanging.  \n  \nThe defendants also unfurled a large banner at the site in which they publicly expressed their hatred of Real Madrid C.F. One of them also posted their actions on social media.  \nThe defendants have acknowledged the events, expressed their remorse and publicly apologised. Each of them has been found guilty of a hate crime and a threat against our player Vinicius Jr.  \nThe court sentenced one of the defendants to one year and ten months in prison and the others to one year and two months.  \n  \nThe defendants will also have to pay the fines handed down, will be banned from exercising professions related to education and sport for a further three years, and have been banned from approaching Vinicius Jr. within 1,000 metres and from communicating in any way with him for four years.  \n  \nIn addition, they will not be allowed to attend or go near any football stadiums where sporting events are taking place during this period of time, and they will have to complete a training programme on equal treatment and non-discrimination.  \n  \nThis criminal conviction comes in addition to the several already handed down in recent months for racist insults received by Real Madrid C.F. players at the stadiums of Zorrilla (Valladolid), Mestalla (Valencia), Son Moix (Palma de Mallorca) and Vallecas (Madrid), including in digital forums. In total, fourteen people have now been criminally convicted of racist attacks against players of our club.  \n  \nReal Madrid has joined its player in prosecuting this case, and in many others currently underway, and will continue to work to protect the values of our club and to eradicate any racist behaviour in the world of football and sport.",
