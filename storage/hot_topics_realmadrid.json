Now I know Ancelotti loves his 433 but against very strong teams we may often need to go with 4 in the middle. \n\nIn the case that we go with 4, what is the most balanced or complementary duo we could have upfront (choosing from Vini, Mbappe, Rodrygo, Brahim and Endrick). \n\nHere I'm interested in profiles more than I am in current form. For example, Endrick is a couple of years away from reaching his best form - Vini also keeps adding to his game. \n\nBut at their best, which combination of 2 players do you think is the most balanced attack? The attack that would bring the best out of both players and be of most benefit to the team.\n\nBONUS: Which trio is the most balanced?",

        "content": "Hope you guys are happy. All I have seen in this sub lately is bad mouthing and questioning Ancelotti every single day. Now I can say, be careful what you wish for. He will likely be leaving at the end of the season, and MAYBE Xabi comes in. Ancelotti has won 3 CLs in 6 seasons with Real Madrid. Two of those CLs with a squad sub par compared to Zidane\u2019s. He has had to deal with injuries, world class players leaving the squad, at times lacking financial backing for signings, a strong opponent in Manchester city (in the CL) and so many more things. Despite this, he\u2019s won everything for us in such a small amount of time. He\u2019s brought in world class players to build the Real Madrid of the future. He\u2019s faced every criticism with dignity and class. He\u2019s the most decorated European Coach in history. Yet our own fans with little to no football knowledge and management criticize him for small things like \u201cNot subbing in Arda earlier, blah blah blah\u201d. I will always back Ancelotti. I\u2019m glad to say I never folded on him like some of the fans here. Hala Madrid y Nada Mas. ",
