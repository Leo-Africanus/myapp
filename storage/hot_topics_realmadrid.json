        "content": "It\u2019s been a day about Luka and Carlo and rightly so. They were both amazing for the club and I have limitless love to both of them. But despite how it ended, let\u2019s show some appreciation to Lucas too. A canterano who is Madridista through and through just like us. Despite his limitations, he gave it all to the club. I know this season was off but until last season, he was a brilliant understudy to Carvajal when he was injured. Switched from being winger to RB because the club needed it. Never complained about anything either. And more important of all, he has the Zidane stamp of approval- Zidane loved him! And we all know how brilliant Zidane was in his judgement of players! Farewell Lucas! We\u2019ll always have galacticos and big names because we\u2019re Real Madrid. Players like Lucas, Joselu, and Nacho are the ones I am worried about. It\u2019s hard to find players who are willing to sacrifice so much for the team and stay dedicated and happy \ud83e\udd79",

No matter who wears the shirt, the spirit of Madridismo lives on \u2014 unbreakable, untouchable.\n\nFor every heartbreak, there has been glory. For every doubt, a response.

        "content": "IMO he also deserved a sending off and a short speech. \n\nSure, this season was awful for him, but keep in mind he played out of position. But besides that, the guy bled white. His whole career at Real Madrid, always ready to do what was needed by the club. No complaining about not starting matches, no complaining about playing out of position. I'm sure he knows how terrible he's been in the RB position, yet he was prepared to ruin his legacy, get booed and receive hate from the fans because the club needed him to play as defender. \n\nPlease show some love for our Lord.",
