        "content": "I can\u2019t believe that the player because of whom I started watching football and supporting Real Madrid is leaving. It doesn\u2019t feel real. Luka wasn\u2019t just another footballer to me, he was the reason I fell in love with the game\n\nFor me,Lukita isn\u2019t just the best midfielder of his generation, he\u2019s my favorite footballer of all time. Nobody comes close. The way he saw the game, the way he controlled tempo, the way he made the impossible look effortless. You couldn\u2019t teach what he had. It was pure instinct, pure magic\n\nI\u2019ll never forget that goal against Manchester United in the 2013 champions league RO 16,  Or his long-range strike vs Granada in 2014, when people were still doubting his impact. The trivela assist to Rodrygo vs Chelsea in 2022 still doesn\u2019t feel real. At 36 years old, delivering that in a Champions League quarterfinal with Madrid on the ropes, only luka\n\nThere was that perfect Champions League final in 2018 against Liverpool, where he quietly ran the whole show. And who can forget the 2016 Clasico at Camp Nou when he bossed the midfield and silenced 90,000 with his poise? That was Modric  never loud, always in control\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the big games. It was the moments in between. The press resistance, the turns in tight spaces, the one touch passes that opened up entire defenses. That little skip he does before passing. The way he pressed like he was 28, even when he was 37. He never stopped giving everything.\n\nI grew up with him. I learned football watching him. Thank you, Luka, for every beautiful moment. For the elegance, the fight, the loyalty. You were the soul of this team. No one will ever wear the number 10 like you did.\n\nYou\u2019ll always be a legend.\n\nHala Madrid y nada m\u00e1s",

        "content": "So the time has finally come. It's gonna be an emotionally charged write up so bear with me.\n\nMy all-time favourite player is finally ending his time with us and I don't understand why.\nHe still has more to give but I guess in a way, it was always inevitable. And still it doesn't make the pain hurt any less.\n\nOne of a few left from that golden generation, the ones that made the 2010's an absolute dream. A little context. We were entering that decade facing off against the mighty Barcelona of Pep Guardiola and Lionel Messi. Who just got the sextuple if memory serves me right. I hate to admit it but that team was very much feared and it looked like dark days ahead. In came Mou to instil some fight in us and of course the likes of Cristiano and Benzema, but in 2012 this man arrived... and I've been in awe ever since. His grit and his shine. The vision to spot a pass or the work ethic to run down an attacker and make a tackle. His feints, the trivelas and of course those rockets into the top corner. He had it all. A complete player.\n\nFinally, la Decima (under another legend who is leaving us) after 12 long, cold years.\nWe all know how that felt when he put that corner in perfectly for Ramos to head that ball into immortality. Moments where you forget about social norms and just scream, cry and bounce around like a child playing with their favourite toy. He was a part of them all. The 3peat with Zizou and the historic KCM trio. The leagues. And then of course helping us throughout the greatest champions league campaign ever in 2022, leaving a younger, \"fitter\" Neymar in the dust. Who could forget nights like that.\n\nWe could go on and on about the memories he's left for us on the field... but the one that I'll always remember was when he was hammered on the plane chanting that song against Atletico after the match in Lisbon. Not sure if I\u2019m allowed to say what he said but he basically told them we run the capital! \n\nA part of me dies every time one of our legends move on. It's a signal to the brain that time is moving rapidly and soon everyone I grew up with will fade away. As they say, it's sad because it was so good.\n\nI thought after Zidane, there would be no other\u2026 I\u2019m glad I was proven wrong.\n\nThe Croatian kid from poverty and war who became a Ballon d'Or winner and the greatest midfielder the world has ever seen. Truly inspirational. But above all, a leader, a great mentor and a true Madridista.\n\nMount Olympus has a spot reserved for you.\n\nThank you for everything, Luka. You'll be missed.",
