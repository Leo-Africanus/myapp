And of course it's our academy reject Baba Diocou, who is having an incredible season - Cristian David mistimes a tackle on the right, the ball comes to Baba, who dribbles spectacularly in the box, breaking Joan's ankles, and finishes near post\n\n\u26bd 32' - 3:0, what are they doing? Corner for Arenas, and Pablo Garc\u00eda rises higher than Joan to head it into the net - absolutely tragic performance from Castilla so far\n\n39' - huge save from Mestre, Arenas could be 4 or 5:0 up here, absolutely inexcusable performance from the players and lineup from Arbeloa \n\n\u26bd 42' - GOLLLL DEL CASTILLA - Pol Fortuny can't reach a ball in the box, and it comes out to Aguado on the left wing instead - he puts in the cross to the bar post, where Y\u00e1\u00f1ez can somehow squeeze it into the net\n\n\u26bd 45' - come on... - tragic loss of possession by Cestero, and Baba Diocou plays an amazing outside of the boot pass to Vizcay - Lamini stumbles all over the place and can't intercept the pass or defend against Vizcay, and he takes a few touches and finishes for another easy goal\n\nHT - Speechless after this performance by Castilla, easily the worst half of this season and one of the worst I've ever seen by any Castilla team - too many experiments in the starting XI by Arbeloa today, and it's quite obvious some players like Liberto, Leiva, Lamini and Cristian David don't have the level for this competition... \n\n\ud83d\udd04 46' - only Valde for Lamini at the half\n\n\ud83d\udd04 59' - Mesonero for Pol Fortuny\n\n66' - first a great free kick by Mesonero that the goalkeeper can save for a corner, then the ball falls to Liberto after the corner and the keeper can direct it to the post - then Castilla shoot again and complain for a handball, and the 4th shot finally goes over the bar \n\n70' - the handball is not given after a challenge - the images are bad, but I didn't see anything punishable either\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 16:15 CET\n\n**Venue:** Campo Municipal de Gobela, Getxo\n\n**Referee**: \n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 1, Matchday 19\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[LaLiga+](https://www.laligaplus.laliga.com/) (subscription - 14.99\u20ac/month) (only available in Spain)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-3-3): Sergio Mestre - Liberto Navascu\u00e9s, Joan Mart\u00ednez, Lamini Fati (46' V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as 'Valde'), Cristian David - Jorge Cestero, Manuel \u00c1ngel, Pol Fortuny (59' Dani Mesonero) - Liberto Navascu\u00e9s, \u00c1lvaro Leiva, Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez\n\nBench: Javi Navarro (GK), Jes\u00fas Fortea, Mario Rivas, Bruno Iglesias, Gabri Castrelo, Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga. \n\nUnavailable: Sergio Mestre (first team call-up), Manu Serrano (injury), David Jim\u00e9nez (first team call-up), Roberto Mart\u00edn (injury), Thiago Pitarch (first team call-up), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Bruno Iglesias (injury), C\u00e9sar Palacios (yellow card accumulation). \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** DWDLW\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 3rd | 31pt | 10-1-7 | 24:21\n",

He might do some recovery program \n\n  \nAsencio is not injured. It was just a scare and his substitution yesterday was error from coaching staff. He is fine and is fit to start against barcelona. \n\n  \nRodrygo is also fine. It is just a minor cramp and he should be fine to start against barcelona\n\n  \nKylian mbappe is travelling to Jeddah to join the rest of the team but it is still unsure that he will start or not. It will be decided tomorrow if he is fit to train. Although medical staff are confident that he is fine. \n\n  \nBellingham was limping yesterday but he is fine. It was just a cramp from the match after playing for 90 minute. \n\n  \nTrent is not going to play against barcelona as he is yet to participate in group training. He is expected to return against villareal or benfica ( Last week of january ).\n\n  \nHope everybody recover well and win the supercopa. Hala madrid y nada mas",
