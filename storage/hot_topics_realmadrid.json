He completed four training sessions during the week, but his feelings weren't particularly good.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti decided to include the Brazilian in the squad for the match against Barcelona in an attempt to protect a player who has been very important in the Italian's four seasons in charge of Real Madrid. But since last February, his importance, in terms of his contribution to the game, has disappeared. Curiously, this season began with doubts due to the BMV issue, but he managed to turn things around. However, this time, he wasn't included in the plans during the week of preparation for the match.\n\nRumors and doubts about his future:\n\nThe substitution in the Cup has been a definitive blow to his morale, to which have been added the numerous rumors that have appeared about his future, which has led to a situation that is not to the liking of the footballer.",

        "content": "we need to bring in someone with a personality like ramos. someone who tolerates no nonsense from the likes of vini and mbappe, who will knock sense into them to press consistently. Ramos didn\u2019t just lead by example; he demanded intensity and discipline from everyone, no matter their star power. with mbappe and Vini\u2019s reluctance to press, that kind of figure becomes even more crucial\u2014someone who commands respect and won\u2019t hesitate to call out laziness, egos, or tactical lapses, especially off the ball. To truly balance the locker room and elevate Madrid\u2019s competitive edge, a contrasting personality is required\u2014someone who will not tolerate lapses in concentration or half-hearted pressing. it doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be a player, it can be a mentor or analyst, but i feel like we desperately need it.",

People here yap a bunch about how we have 3 LWs, M'Bappe isn't a real striker, blabalbla... yeah yeah, he's in pole position for the pichichi race, behind Lewandoski who has a much better Barcelona team behind him too.\n\n2) About midfield. Not a player issue. People talk about lacking the creative passes and such. We have Guler and Bellingham whom, if played more strictly in central positions (CAM and CM respectively) instead of Carlo sending Arda on right wing and Bellingham in every single position known to man, would 100% provide all the needed passes. And while Tchouameni/Camavinga/Ceballos aren't Makalele, they can be more than plenty at CDM, hell we have Valverde who could play there amazingly as well once Trent takes over RB.\n\n3) Defense... yeah I got nothing here. I think Ascensio and Rudiger is an awesome CB combo but Ascensio lacks experience and Rudiger is basically like Pepe nowadays, either very good or very dumb.\n\nI know we'll have a bunch of signings but I really think all we needed was a defender or two. We have good enough players, they just all seem to be out of place in most games this season, with unclear instructions and little structure or discipline.",
