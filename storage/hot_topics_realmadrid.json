He gets brought down by the keeper, but the referee gives the advantage, and Y\u00e1\u00f1ez taps it into the empty net for the lead! \n\n79' - Free kick from a great position taken by David Jim\u00e9nez who curls it over the wall, but the keeper can make a great save to deny it \n\n\ud83d\udd04 83' - Loren Aguado and Antonio David for David Jim\u00e9nez and Chema. MOTM performance by David, who's had a great season so far, inexplicable why he doesn't get some minutes in the first team over Lucas or even Lorenzo \n\n\u26bd 90'+5 - goal for Intercity in the last play... Cross from the left, then there was a clear push on Jacobo... The ball bounces off of Modeste, and in the end Nacho Gonz\u00e1lez pushes it over the line... So incredibly undeserved\n\nFT - Castilla drop two points in the last seconds against last-placed Intercity in the chase for the playoff spots - the team showed another good performance and deserved the win here, but it wasn't meant to be. They climb up to 5th position for the moment, and stay undefeated in 2025 with 5 wins and 3 draws \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 12:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Poliesportiu Sant Joan D\u2019Alacant, Alicante \n\n**Referee**: \n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 2, Matchday 26\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[FEF TV](https://feftv.com) (subscription - 12.99\u20ac/month)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-2-3-1): Mario de, Luis - Youssef Enr\u00edquez \u2018Yusi\u2019, Edgar Pujol, Jacobo Ram\u00f3n, Mario Rivas, David Jim\u00e9nez (83' Lorenzo Aguado) - Jos\u00e9 Maria Andr\u00e9s \u2018Chema\u2019 (83' Antonio David), Manuel \u00c1ngel - Borja Alonso (66' Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez), Gonzalo Garc\u00eda, V\u00edctor Mu\u00f1oz \n\nBench: Diego Pii\u00f1eiro (GK), V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as \u2018Valde\u2019, David Ruiz, Andr\u00e9s Campos, Jeremy de Le\u00f3n, Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga \n\nUnavailable: Fran Gonz\u00e1lez (first team call-up), Ra\u00fal Asencio (first team call-up), Quique Ribes (suspension), David Cuenca (pubalgia), Jacobo Ram\u00f3n (first team call-up), C\u00e9sar Palacios (ACL tear). \n\nCoach: Ra\u00fal\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** DWWDW\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 7th | 36pt | 9-9-7 | 42:27",

        "title": "The biggest takeaway from yesterday's game was that Jude, Fede, Asencio, and Ceballos are our key players.",
        "content": "Yesterday's game made me realize once again that Federico Valverde, Jude, Dani Ceballos, and Asencio cannot be benched or rested if we want to win the league and the Champions League. Sadly, this is true, although I know Ceballos is injured. Ceballos has become an important player as a starter, as he has solved our ball progression issues and facilitated buildup from midfield, which we clearly lacked yesterday. There was no connectivity between our attack and midfield, and no one on the pitch knew how to create something out of nothing. Plus, yeah our attackers were equally unimpressive and ass through out the game as if they were forced to play the game.\n\nAnd and, I just hope Carlo must have learned his lesson by now... benching Asensio for Rudiger, Alaba, or Militao would be a disaster. Two of them have just returned from long injuries, and rushing them back into the team at this critical point in the season won't do us any good. Asencio is in the form of his life, so do not disrupt his rhythm. Resting him at this point.. doesn't make any sense plus it looks more ridiculous when rudiger was clearly struggling yet carlo didn't seem to care at all. Lol.. I don't know, what was that. \n\nAnd Lastly, I wanna admit one thing, I never thought Ceballos would become this important for our team, but here we are. His injury couldn't have come at a worse time, and now we can only hope that Valverde and Jude stay fit... otherwise, we're doomed. These three, along with Asensio, don't give up until the last moment(didn't mean, others don't have this fighting spirit, but these 4 possess some next level kinda madridismo) and this kind of passion was missing from our team yesterday.",

        "title": "My thoughts from the match last night:",
        "content": "\n1) Alaba ain't that guy anymore. I believe everyone agrees that Raul Asencio should have started and the game wouldn't have gotten that bad. Despite Betis' great performance, the goals conceded were relatively easily avoidable. The equalizing header was from point blank, no one was marking the goalscorer. In contrast, look how they defended our set piece completely blocking off Rudiger or any other player from having a decent header. Then there was the stupid penalty Rudiger conceded which wouldn't have happened if he had Raul with him in that position. Our center backs got outran all game. Primarily I believe this was what made us lose the upper hand in this game. We couldn't defend properly leading to a vicious cycle of weathering attack after attack without much opportunities to answer back. Of course it didn't help that Betis have players that are good on the ball under pressure. If Carlo didn't play Raul Asencio because of what happened previously and he is trying to protect him, then I understand, though I think it was unneeded. \n\n2) Brahim was great for like the first 20 minutes then immediately shut down afterwards. He was just getting unnecessarily dispossessed and misplacing easy passes. I don't know what went over him. Does anyone know what went wrong? He was having an at least 9/10 performance then started dropping stinkers all of a sudden. At that point I would rather have had Rodrygo or Arda (though still not decided about him) in the midfield. \n\n3) Vini wasn't that bad. He was dangerous the few times he was on the ball. But there were times I sensed some hastiness in his game. Same with Rodrygo, and Mbappe as well. They let the pressure get to them too much. But our defense is to blame because it didn't give the team the breathing room it was supposed to give. We were just getting cooked in the flanks and our center backs were struggling badly. The useless and unnecessary long balls from Tchoumeni and Courtois didn't help much either. I get Cortouis can't play short but he should always try to play the ball in middle of two or three Madrid shirts where they have a higher chance of winning the second ball, not to the opponent's center backs. I was just exasperated everytime he did that. Other than that, he saved us from a worse scorline. \n\n4) Camavinga is a bad passer and a bad playmaker. He has decent technique but he hasn't improved in three years in terms of decision making and awareness. Just tackle, dribble, long pass (or cross) and inshallah. He is overrated. Hope he improves, if not he should be sold for a proper midfielder.  \n\n5) Tchoumeni wasn't that bad and I don't want to scapegoat him. That said, he has a lot of things to improve upon. Like his challenges, could have conceded a penalty. He was also misplacing some easy passes that killed our attack. \n\n6) Carlo should have shut down the long ball tactics against Betis. Especially when we were having success between the lines. They weren't playing a high line and we didn't have numerical advantages to win the second ball. Only one time something meaningful came from this tactic was when Modric won a second ball which lead to a chance though it was fumbled by Vinicius afterward. Other than that the long balls were useless. \n\n\n\n--\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Though our midfield and attacking performance was poor overall, the starting center back pairing and poor defense overall made this game more difficult than it would have been, because there would have been less pressure and hastiness on former's side, especially the front three . \n\nOverall the season is still undecided so there's no need to be pessimistic though it definitely isn't looking too good right now.",

I am posting it as a text thread since the links keep getting auto-deleted. The mods and I have been in contact, but we haven't figured out why they keep getting auto deleted yet. When recording your responses keep in mind that a **1** should be reserved for truly awful, career-worst games, while a **10** should reflect an exceptional, near-perfect match. Try to be as objective as possible\u2014focus on the overall gameplay and not just immediate frustrations. Have a good weekend.",
