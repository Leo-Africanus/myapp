        "title": "Why Dean Huijsen is a good signing?",
        "content": "Now I am not saying he will be successful or jinxing it in anyway. I'm saying he fixes the key issues in our defense and reduces our flaws in that central defensive zone.                                                                                         \n\n1. He is a proactive defender so he likes to be aggressive with his defensive actions. So if the opposition counter attacks he likes to step forward to make the challenge therefore  not leaving them space and time on the midfield and defense gaps exposed and limiting option for the ball carrier. The major thing is that this is supported by asencio's recovery pace. therefore even if the flaws of a single centre back pushing to press the ball carrier can be expected (like bypassing huijsen), this can be nullified by asencio's recovery pace and ability.                                                                                                                                                        \n2. His aerial ability is gonna be a huge boost to our backline and our set piece chances. A 6'6 defender known for his high aerial duels won percentile is perfection needed right now for our team. Our teams struggle with aerial duels is no shock for us as we know other than 3 first team players, our whole team is under 6 foot.                                                                                                                                                                   3. \n3. Great at starting offensive plays. He is a driver with a ball. His quality on the ball is one of the best. One of the main things everyone talks about is his ability to dribble with the from his half to the oppsition half. This is key for us as we lack options to progressive the ball against high pressing teams.                                             \n\n4. well the known facts: he's spanish and young( hence more time to improve and pick up his game to another level, even if he stumbles in his first couple of months or a year in spain due to the new environment he has time to grow as he's just 20, 2 years younger than raul asencio and same age as arda).                Also remember give them time, most signings take time to recover their game or improve as its a new country, environment and tactics. Let's not be harsh and see how it goes.",
