The results of this question was 2.42. \n\nThe next question was about whose fault is the UCL elimination against Arsenal. This question is realy close, so I think there's not winner at all.\n\nThen I ask wich player/s should RM sell.\n*As I'm stupid af I typed Eduard Mendy intead of Ferland, when I realized I edited it so just sum up the votes and %\n\nAnother question was wich posistion should RM reinforce. I typed the majority of possitions but I added the option to add more. \n\nIn the next question I asked for players to sign this summer transfer window:\n\nHuijsen 34\nTAA 26\nWirtz 10\nVitinha 4\nM.

I saw Yamal and, yes, he's really good and creates a lot of chances, but he misses a lot of passes, too. He makes unnecessary and useless dribbles, and attempts crosses that get nowhere. However, I see madridistas all the time showering him in praises they never have for Vinicius.\n\nVini has been an incredibly effective player for years and he has been doing that in high profile games as well. But he gets trashed over and over because of his misses, like his good plays didn't exist. Is it really that difficult to show him more support than what is shown to the rival?",
