But PSG \u201cdeserves\u201d it too. \n\nI just don\u2019t want Arsenal to win as they have some of the most obnoxious fans I have ever encountered \u2014 online and in person. They are already condescending, and they haven\u2019t even won a single UCL trophy\u2026 so imagine if they win one. \n\nI don\u2019t like Aston Villa as well because I can\u2019t stand their goalkeeper. Period. lol\n\nI do want to see Bayern Munich lifting the trophy! Or Inter! Bayern Munich because I\u2019m British, and I want to see Kane win a trophy (finally) hahaha.
