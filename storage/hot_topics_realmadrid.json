We\u2019ve got the midfield depth, the pace up top, and defenders who can hold a line and push forward when needed. If we end up signing Carreras, that left side becomes dangerous. The balance across this formation is exciting and if we can stay healthy, this could be one of the most dynamic lineups we\u2019ve had in years. What do you think about this setup?

        "content": "As the title suggests, went to the Sofitel hotel a day before the match. Initially, there were about 40-50 people waiting outside. The players directly went in but Solari came out to hand out his signature. Later, with about 20-30 people remaining, Xabi came in after his press conference and gave autographs as well!",

The way he went around the goalkeeper, the way he made those runs into the box and best of all the chip shots from impossible angles (yes, he was the best in the world in chip shots!) Ra\u00fal breathed Madridismo.. Carried the badge like a true gentleman. The Castilla players of the past few seasons say the same thing- he was very strict and taught them to value what representing Real Madrid means.. Happy birthday Raul.

        "content": "Real Madrid are pressing as a unit, moving in well coordinated blocks, playing quickly, rotating with purpose, passing cleanly, and occupying clearly defined positions. It no longer feels like just one player is running the entire pitch for the team. Now every player seems to have a defined role. We\u2019re playing with a back three and honestly I don\u2019t know what the final score will be, but I\u2019m crying tears of joy.\n\nIt\u2019s incredible to see how structured the system is tactically. The way the lines compress and expand depending on the moment of the game shows how well drilled this squad is.",
