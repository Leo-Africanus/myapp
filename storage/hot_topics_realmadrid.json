        "content": "#FT: JUVENIL A 1:2 VALENCIA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#COPA DE CAMPEONES\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:**\n\n0:1 Aimar Bl\u00e1zquez (p) 55'\n\n1:1 Jaime Barroso (p) 84'\n\n1:2 David Otorbi 90'+5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - kickoff, vamos! \n\n16' - Fortea is through on goal after a long ball, gets pulled to the floor with force by the Valencia player, red card, yellow at the minimum, the referee doesn't even give a foul however... \n\n40' - Our boys are pushing hard for the opener now, the Valencia keeper can first save a rebound by Pitarch after a cross from the left, then he makes a good save on a shot from distance by Roberto Mart\u00edn\n\n44' - Y\u00e1\u00f1ez shot from the edge of the box is saved easily by the Valencia keeper, then moments later, on the other side of the pitch, Javi Navarro can save a one on one with the Valencia attacker to prevent their lead\n\nHT - 0:0 after an even first half with both teams having had chances to potentially take the lead. Juvenil A started gaining more control as the half went on, and Valencia could or should've already received a red card \n\n46' - 2nd half underway\n\n49' - biggest chance for Juvenil A so far after Cestero puts through Y\u00e1\u00f1ez, but the goalkeeper makes a great save to deny his shot into the bottom left corner\n\n53' - penalty for Valencia, Liberto was holding on to the Valencia players shirt, but another Valencia player had already shot the ball way out of bounds - another very controversial call... \n\n\u26bd 55' - Bl\u00e1zquez steps up and converts... \n\n\ud83d\udd04 58' - Barroso for Rivera \n\n60' - the team has been extremely dominant in this second half so far, with multiple situations of chaos in Valencias box, where our boys missed the chance to finish the situation off\n\n\ud83d\udd04 80' - Pol Dur\u00e1n for Liberto \n\n83' - penalty for Juvenil A after Cestero is pulled in the box - unlike the penalty Valencia got, the cross was actually headed for our player\n\n\u26bd 84' - GOLLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - Barroso converts! \n\n\u26bd 90'+5 - Otorbi scores for Valencia - how can you defend like that in added time? Fortea is nowhere to be seen as Valencia attack over the left side - Lamini can clear, but the ball gets cleared out to the left again - Lezcano has to step out because Fortea is still gone, the cross comes in, Navarro can't catch it and Aguado is left against two opponents at the far post, where Otorbi nods it into the net\n\nFT - Arbeloa's career as Juvenil A's coach ends with the textbook template of the Juvenil A matches of the past years, superior, dominant, countless opportunities to win the match, and in the end we get scored on with their first chance in the entire half due  to laziness and naivety tracking back - Valencia go to the final against Betis or Deportivo, and all in all, it was a pretty disappointing season for Juvenil A \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 20:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Municipal de Toral\u00edn, Ponferrada\n\n**Referee:** Alexandre L\u00f3pez Vila\n\n**Competition:** Copa de Campeones, Final Four, Semi-Final\n\n**Viewing options:** [YouTube RFEF](https://www.youtube.com/live/I-5RxqVfWAs?si=xSflicQju-Rq20bh), [RMTV/RM PLAY](https://play.realmadrid.com/home)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Juvenil A XI (4-3-3):** Javi Navarro - Diego Aguado, Lamini Fati, \u00c1lvaro Lezcano, Jes\u00fas Fortea - Jorge Cestero, Thiago Pitarch, Roberto Mart\u00edn - Liberto Navascu\u00e9s (80' Pol Dur\u00e1n), Pol Rivera (58' Jaime Barroso), Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez\n\nBench: \u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez (GK), Diego Arroyo (GK), Roi Torres, \u00d3scar Mesa, Mario Rivas, Izan Regueira, Marco Company, Pablo Montero, Aimar Santiago. \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n",

We should hold in mind that Barcelona under Flick\u2019s management will continue(mostly probably) to grow and they will became stronger too. Xabi is our weapon. There will be mistakes of course and maybe painful mistakes too.

        "title": "How are so many midfielders (+more potential midfielders) gonna be managed in our squad?",
        "content": "The current real madrid team already has some of the best midfielders in the world like jude bellingham and federico valverde. We have so many more great midfielders like aur\u00e9lien tchouam\u00e9ni, eduardo camavinga, dani ceballos and a potential rising star in the form of arda guler. Moreover there are talks abt buying nico paz back from como (who had an incredible breakthrough season winning the best u-23 player award) plus angelo stiller who absolutely balled this season and was recommended by toni kroos himself.\n\nNow I know that lots of our discussion will depend upon xabi alonso's tactics and future signings but still I think over team we would need to be selling some of these players and some might wanna leave on their own when they don't get enough playing time (cz its impossible to give everyone the adequate playing time when we have such a start-studded squad)\n\nI think there's no doubt that bellingham, valverde and tchouameni are here to stay. Camavinga has been a bit injured due to which his form this season was poor compared to his prvs standards. Ceballos had a great few seasons but he has always been inconsistent throughout his madrid career and sadly since coming back from his injury he hasn't been the same for us like he was during his purple patch. Arda guler had limited opportunites to prove himself but he did have a great game vs barcelona.\n\nThat said we definitely need a tempo-setter and the best possible option for that wuld be angelo stiller. Arda culd be our creative midfielder under a proper coach and he has the potential as we all culd see. Imo we wuld need to get rid of ceballos sooner or later and let nico paz still develop for now (or if the board wants use him instead of arda guler cz he has actually proven himself that too while playing for a midtable team. He has 6 goals and 8 assists this season for Como). \n\nIn the next few transfer windows we wuld need to totally revamp this squad especially our defense and in that we wuld need to get rid of all the wealkings. For now if we can get carreras and stiller along with taa and huijsen it wuld be an incredible transfer window.",

        "content": "o, there has been a bit of debate in the sub about the necessity of Stiller.\n\nWithout entering into the need for a midfielder or not (and I believe we definitely need one to go into the season calm and assured that injuries cannot derail our season), this is a good image of the qualities Angelo Stiller displays.\n\nHere are all the European under-24 midfielders, and you can check his numbers in winning duels % and successful progressive passes.\n\nAs you can see, he is elite in both categories at the same time. You can see in the photo Pedri, Camavinga, Marc Casado, and also, if you are interested, see the big lie that Gavi is.\n\nAnother player I like is Adrian Bernabe, but Stiller is much better.\n\nHere, we cannot see the comparison with Tchouameni because he is over 24, but I think this is a good display of why this player caught the eye of Alonso and Real Madrid.\n\nThe guy is elite at bringing the ball forward, and that will help us to quickly bypass the high press of Arsenal and Bar\u00e7a, bringing the ball to Vini and Mbapp\u00e9 in an advantageous position.\n\nThis guy, together with Trent, is exactly the piece we need to break those teams' high pressure that was so difficult to handle this year.",

        "content": "There\u2019s been some talk about Nico Paz possibly returning to Madrid.\n\nPersonally I\u2019d love to see a homegrown player in the squad, Nico has really impressed with his development. But it feels like we already have a similar profile in the team, and many of us agree that another season at Como might be the best move for his growth.\n\nThat said, with Bellingham set to miss around three months due to shoulder surgery, Nico could be a perfect solution to fill that role, but then what? \nReports from Spain suggest he\u2019s not coming back just to sit on the bench, if he returns it\u2019s to compete for real minutes, which is exactly why he left in the first place.\n\nNow personally, I\u2019d still love to see us bring in Angelo Stiller to add more control and creativity in midfield, like Kroos used to provide. Or who knows, maybe Alonso will find his flow without that. \nBut let\u2019s be honest, we\u2019re already overloaded in that position and Ceballos probably needs to go.\n\nAll this midfield talk is stressing me out, not gonna lie, I want them all in the squad.\n\nWhat do you all think?\n\u2022 Is it worth bringing Nico back for the Club World Cup and the start of the season?\n\u2022 Do you see him getting meaningful minutes?\n\u2022 Could he even jump ahead of G\u00fcler in the pecking order?\n",
