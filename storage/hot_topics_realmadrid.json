        "content": "I genuinely cannot understand how Vini has 3 straight seasons of being the best LW in the world, or atleast a top 3, from 21/22 up until the middle of last season, consistently being a big gamer player, consistently hitting 40+g/a, even last season which was a bad season for Vini, he hits 40+g/a, but the moment he has a bad season, this sub is calling for him to be benched or even sold, while Rodrygo is incredibly inconsistent but somehow doesn't meet the same type of criticism as Vini?\n\nRodrygo hasn't scored a league goal since January, and this sub thinks he's gonna magically be better than Vini at LW because he had a good run of games in december? Like, Rodrygo has a pretty consistent history of being a very inconsistent player, he'll play anywhere between bad to okay, but never really amazing, but then, usually in November to January, he'll have a really good run of games, and thats all people really remember, and its enough for people to want him to replace Vini, who has been a consistently top 3 player in the LW spot? Like why would you ever even take this gamble on that Rodrygo will magically lose his inconsistent nature once he's put on the LW position?\n\nI know all the comments are gonna talk about how Rodrygo is being played out of position, but come on, they guy has been playing RW for like 4 or 5 seasons at this point, when are you gonna stop treating him with baby gloves? He either adapts to the position, like Bale did, or he gets benched or sold for someone who is better in that position. I love Rodrygo, i think every madrid fan does, but holy fuck i cannot understand how you guys will relentlessly shit on Vini for half of a bad season, but you will praise Rodrygo endlessly while he disappears for months on end?",

He gave him barely any minutes at the Club World Cup, no assuring statements from him during pressers ever, and not once has he hinted that Rodrygo is part of his long term vision. What\u2019s even more confusing is that Rodrygo is pretty much Xabi\u2019s type of player. Low on unnecessary flair and extravagant shehnanigans, high on work rate, pressing discipline, and tactical side. He\u2019s not flashy like some, but as lethal , technical and clinical as they come. I really thought Xabi would be high on Rodrygo but have never got the vibe that Rodrygo is someone he\u2019d pick or build around. Sure, Vini and Mbapp\u00e9 are undisputed starters but that doesn\u2019t justify the brutal sidelining of a player of Rodrygo\u2019s calibre imo.",

Is he in your all time TOP 25 players for RM? Does anyone have him as his favourite? Strictly footballing-wise, not as a polticial, galactico statement.",
