During those tests, it was discovered that the World Cup winner\u2019s heart was not functioning properly.\n\n\\&gt; Carlos was quickly rushed in for what is described as emergency surgery to address the issue.\n\n\\&gt; AS add that a complication extended the procedure from 40 minutes up to three hours but, thankfully, all appears to be well.\n\n\\&gt; Due to the complication, MARCA predict Carlos will be kept in hospital for the next two days for monitoring.\n\n\\&gt; Contacted for comment by the Spanish paper, Carlos is quoted as saying: \u201cI\u2019m fine now and under close surveillance.\u201d",

I don\u2019t see him picking up his level, and many of his childish actions are starting to annoy even his most loyal supporters. It\u2019s funny how many think that the fanbase is being fake, when we have supported him a lot. Mbappe being in the team makes him the main man, there is no spot for Vini who wants to be the star. There is just a lot of reasons why Vini will most likely leave. If by any chance, we give him the contract he wants, then that will be a massive mistake. If he leaves for a decent amount of money, or even he doesn\u2019t bring much money, it will open up space for other important signings. The best move is for him to leave, not only for the club but for his own career.\n\nEdit: No, I am not a player fan. I don\u2019t care who plays or doesn\u2019t as long as we win.
