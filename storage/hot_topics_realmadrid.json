They\u2019re legends of their own, you see them all pressing, running behind the ball. You even see Cristiano at minute 75 in our area defending a corner. That\u2019s why we won 3 CL in a row. Nobody complained about anyone\u2019s work rate and they all ran. That was a team. We have some of the best players in each position at this day and age and I believe things can work out but our team has an attitude problem not necessarily lack of quality or tactics and I do think even Vini and Mbappe can play together. I hope Xabi\u2019s presence shows that he is not there to make friends but to mold a bunch of players into a team. If they all collectively put as much heart as Valverde does, we would steamroll most teams in La Liga and compete against the big ones in Europe. ",

        "content": "I know this might sound unpopular, but hear me out. I\u2019ve followed Real Madrid for a long time. I remember watching Iker Casillas make his debut at 18 against Athletic Bilbao. He was a legend, no doubt. Amazing reflexes, clutch saves, a symbol of the club.\n\nBut if we\u2019re being honest, Casillas had flaws too. He was shaky at times, especially on crosses and aerial balls. That\u2019s one of the reasons why he eventually lost his place to Diego L\u00f3pez around the age of 31.\n\nNow look at Courtois.\n\nSince he joined Real Madrid, he completely owned the number one spot. Nobody questioned it. Not even Keylor Navas, who had great moments and made big saves, could truly challenge him. But Keylor also had weaknesses, especially when it came to dealing with high balls and staying consistent.\n\nCourtois brings something different. He\u2019s calm, dominant in the air, and shows up in big matches. Just think about the Champions League final in Paris. That performance wasn\u2019t just good, it was historic.\n\nEven now, despite his age and the time missed due to injury, nobody is seriously thinking about replacing him. That level of trust says a lot.\n\nIn my opinion, Courtois is the most complete and consistent goalkeeper we\u2019ve had in modern Real Madrid history. Not trying to erase what Casillas did. But based on what I\u2019ve seen, Courtois is that guy.",

        "title": "Xabi Alonso and the Non-Negotiable Work Rate: Will Mbappe or Vini Jr. Face the Bench?",
        "content": "Alright Madristas,\n\nLet's talk about the burning question at Real Madrid under Xabi Alonso: Will he actually bench Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 or Vinicius Jr. if they don't consistently track back and contribute defensively?\n\nWe've all seen the dazzling runs, the insane goals, the moments of pure individual brilliance from these two. But for years, a common criticism, especially of Mbapp\u00e9 at PSG and at times Vini Jr. under Ancelotti, has been their perceived lack of defensive involvement. With Alonso now at the helm, a manager who built a historically disciplined, high-work-rate Bayer Leverkusen side, this issue is amplified.\n\nAlonso's philosophy is crystal clear. He has repeatedly stressed the importance of a collective defensive effort, stating, \"In my view, we ALL have to defend. The 11 players have to press. Vinicius Jr, Jude, Fede Valverde, Mbapp\u00e9. All of them.\" This isn't just lip service; his Leverkusen team operated with an intense, synchronized press and positional discipline that was instrumental to their unbeaten season.\n\nLooking at last season, particularly in the recent Club World Cup semifinal loss to PSG, reports surfaced about Alonso holding \"crunch talks\" with both Mbapp\u00e9 and Vini Jr. regarding their on-field attitudes and defensive work rate. While Mbapp\u00e9's illness might have played a role, the sentiment from the club hierarchy, as reported by Marca, was a concern over the team's lack of fluency and failure to work together defensively, stemming from an alleged lack of effort from the attacking duo.\n\nWe saw glimpses of Vini Jr. putting in more defensive shifts under Ancelotti at times, but it was often inconsistent. Mbapp\u00e9, on the other hand, has a well-documented history of conserving energy for attacking exploits.\n\nSo, the question is: are these world-class talents truly \"non-negotiable\" in Alonso's system, even if their defensive contributions don't meet his rigorous standards? Or will the sheer offensive output outweigh the defensive compromises? Leverkusen's success was built on a strong collective, not just individual brilliance.\nWhat do you all think? Has Xabi Alonso shown enough resolve at Leverkusen to suggest he'd make such a drastic call? Or are Mbapp\u00e9 and Vini Jr. simply too important to ever be benched, forcing Alonso to adapt his system around them? \n",
