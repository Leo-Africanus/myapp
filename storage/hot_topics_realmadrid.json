        "content": "Last week, I traveled with a friend to the CWC. See saw Chelsea vs Esperance, and Real vs. Salzburg.\n\nI have been a Madrid fan since they signed Ronaldo, and have been watching soccer as a die-hard fan of the sport since 2014, and have become probably a super nerd (reading books on tactics, re-watching old games, watching academy games and things) since the 21-22 season.\n\nI have only seen Madrid play once, against AC Milan in a pre-season friendly.\n\nBoth of us from US.\n\nWe both had an amazing time. I know there is a lot of outrage of inhumane temperature, and amount of games being played and sports washing -- and I am on board for all of that. But for less than $100 per ticket, which is a fair exchange for a U.S. sports fan, in example my Dallas Cowboys tickets are always over $200 for a regular season game, it was a good value. I had pretty decent seats too for both games, the Chelsea game was a bit better with being just behind the corner flag, 10-11 rows back for like $75.\n\nThe atmosphere was amazing. The only sporting events I have been that come close is college football. Esperance and Real Madrid fans were passionate, lively, and awesome to talk to. I met fans traveling all over the world, many taking 2-3-4 flights to get to the U.S., and staying for every game.\n\nIt was also dope to see a game in which mattered -- there were scenes after every goal, and loads of passion -- even more than I expected when I bought the tickets.\n\nOverall, it was a 10/10 experience, not thinking about the other variables. And while a lot of people shit on the U.S. for soccer culture, and being undeserving of a tournament like this, or that not a lot of people care, it was dope to have this experience with my friend that ill never forget. They were also so many passionate RM fans there. \n\nSeeing Xabi ball live with 3-5-2, and Tchouameni in that Libero role, and a Gonzalo goal was so amazing. So much pressing and tracking back that was not even captured on the tele cam that I saw in the stadium, but not when I rewatched back.\n\nI really hope we win this thing and I can say I saw a part of our club's history. \n\n  \n",

        "content": "I've been thinking about how to get all our best players on the pitch, and this is the starting XI I\u2019ve come up with. Let me know what you think.\n\n**Formation: 3-4-3**\n\n**Defence:** Huijsen, Tchouam\u00e9ni, Carvajal\n\n* Tchouam\u00e9ni can step into midfield as a pivot when needed.\n* Carvajal is the best option to cover Trent\u2019s flank on the right.\n\n**Midfield (left to right):** Bellingham, Valverde, G\u00fcler, Trent\n\n* In defence, Bellingham should act as the left winger/wing-back, but he\u2019s free to drift centrally when we attack. Valverde and Huijsen would then cover the left flank on counters.\n* I usually prefer Valverde on the right with more freedom, but in this XI I\u2019d keep him left-central to back up Bellingham.\n* Trent on the right is a no-brainer.\n\n**Attack:** Vin\u00edcius, Mbapp\u00e9, Mastantuono\n\n* Mastantuono might not start right away, but with his current trajectory I can see him breaking into the first XI later this year.\n\nWhat do you think?",

        "content": "I am watching the PSG miami game and watched city juve , and one thing i noticed was they have such a sustained high press. Madrid players seem to get tired after pressing in bursts and then they drop back. Whereas city and psg press on constantly and create dangerous chances constantly. What do you think the problem is ? Our players seem to get tired way too quickly ",
