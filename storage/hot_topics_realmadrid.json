There will be mistakes of course and maybe painful mistakes too.

        "content": "The current real madrid team already has some of the best midfielders in the world like jude bellingham and federico valverde. We have so many more great midfielders like aur\u00e9lien tchouam\u00e9ni, eduardo camavinga, dani ceballos and a potential rising star in the form of arda guler. Moreover there are talks abt buying nico paz back from como (who had an incredible breakthrough season winning the best u-23 player award) plus angelo stiller who absolutely balled this season and was recommended by toni kroos himself.\n\nNow I know that lots of our discussion will depend upon xabi alonso's tactics and future signings but still I think over team we would need to be selling some of these players and some might wanna leave on their own when they don't get enough playing time (cz its impossible to give everyone the adequate playing time when we have such a start-studded squad)\n\nI think there's no doubt that bellingham, valverde and tchouameni are here to stay. Camavinga has been a bit injured due to which his form this season was poor compared to his prvs standards. Ceballos had a great few seasons but he has always been inconsistent throughout his madrid career and sadly since coming back from his injury he hasn't been the same for us like he was during his purple patch. Arda guler had limited opportunites to prove himself but he did have a great game vs barcelona.\n\nThat said we definitely need a tempo-setter and the best possible option for that wuld be angelo stiller. Arda culd be our creative midfielder under a proper coach and he has the potential as we all culd see. Imo we wuld need to get rid of ceballos sooner or later and let nico paz still develop for now (or if the board wants use him instead of arda guler cz he has actually proven himself that too while playing for a midtable team. He has 6 goals and 8 assists this season for Como). \n\nIn the next few transfer windows we wuld need to totally revamp this squad especially our defense and in that we wuld need to get rid of all the wealkings. For now if we can get carreras and stiller along with taa and huijsen it wuld be an incredible transfer window.",

        "content": "We lost all matches against Barca and I think there\u2019s gonna be a focus on making sure the next season isn\u2019t the same. Madrid will need to win against them. But Yamal imo has turned into a player that cannot be handled by a single defender.  He has a lot of positional freedom and he\u2019s just too dangerous with the ball. 1v1 is also very likely to go his way. And Pedri is the best at what he does - controlling the tempo and directing plays. You also have Balde, who before his injury was having an incredible season. He\u2019s a strong carrier and likes to run deep. I\u2019m very curious to see how Xabi Alonso decides to deal with Barca\u2019s threat. He likes to have roles rather than positions. \n\nFor people who\u2019ve seen Leverkusen games, how has Xabi dealt with very threatening individual players? Has he altered or changed his tactics for specific players? I know that he\u2019s known to exploit his opponents\u2019 weaknesses e.g. using players like Grimaldo, Frimpong, Boniface. But curious if he\u2019s dealt with opponent threats in a similar fashion.",

        "content": "o, there has been a bit of debate in the sub about the necessity of Stiller.\n\nWithout entering into the need for a midfielder or not (and I believe we definitely need one to go into the season calm and assured that injuries cannot derail our season), this is a good image of the qualities Angelo Stiller displays.\n\nHere are all the European under-24 midfielders, and you can check his numbers in winning duels % and successful progressive passes.\n\nAs you can see, he is elite in both categories at the same time. You can see in the photo Pedri, Camavinga, Marc Casado, and also, if you are interested, see the big lie that Gavi is.\n\nAnother player I like is Adrian Bernabe, but Stiller is much better.\n\nHere, we cannot see the comparison with Tchouameni because he is over 24, but I think this is a good display of why this player caught the eye of Alonso and Real Madrid.\n\nThe guy is elite at bringing the ball forward, and that will help us to quickly bypass the high press of Arsenal and Bar\u00e7a, bringing the ball to Vini and Mbapp\u00e9 in an advantageous position.\n\nThis guy, together with Trent, is exactly the piece we need to break those teams' high pressure that was so difficult to handle this year.",
