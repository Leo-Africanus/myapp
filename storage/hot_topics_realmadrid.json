        "content": "1) Rodrygo has been phenomenal this season so far. He's helping out the main men up fron each game and i feel like since mbappe's arrival fans are treating him like a ordinary player which he absolutely isn't.  He's been active and his work rate is great. He is creating, scoring and time and again holding the links in the attacks and in the midfield from time to time. \n2) Raul Asensio: no one in the beginning of the season would have thought that he will be getting this much time but i am glad he did get it. \nHe's proved that he is worthy of being in that position and man i am a fan of his play style.  With our main guys injured he has done a phenomenal job at defense so far. \n3) Finally Fede. Is there a position this guy can't play at?\nHe's done and is doing a great job at midfield. He's scoring bangers after bangers this season and now his defensive work as the RB against City was so dammm good. He was holding players down, winning duels , slide tacking them giving great clearance his distribution looked great. He's just amazing at everything he does.\n",

Given that he's playing on the big stage for the first time, his confidence, reading of the game, and ability are absolutely astonishing. I'm in awe of how good he's turning out to be. He played another flawless game tonight, and I genuinely love watching him. Everything about his game is outstanding... from his reading of the play to his on-ball qualities, courage, and impeccable ability to block balls with sliding tackles. His ability to clear the ball in dangerous areas while keeping a level head is impressive. I'm at a loss for words to praise his abilities. What a gem of a player we've discovered this season!\n\nAnd I love how down-to-earth he is. When asked if he's earned a starting spot, his humble response was, 'No, I just work day to day and let the coach decide.' I loved his response - this is how legends are made, with dedication, commitment, and hard work. And he has all those qualities. \n\nHopefully, Our future captain!:) ",

        "content": "I don't follow La Liga or Real but this season I've seen two Real games - the El Classico last autumn where Mbappe had a massive stinker of a game, his confidence was shot and seemed like a shell of himself. Yesterday he looked like a football God out there. Silky, smooth, composed, confident and calm as you'd like. It was a joy to watch. So after such two polar opposite performances that's I've seen from him, it begs the question of how is he doing so far this season? I remember hearing in the beginning he was playing kind of poorly and way below his standards (idk if it's legit tho). Has he improved since then, how would you grade his performance out of 10 so far?",
