        "content": "They are well....... not exactly favourites to win so maybe some of the other players can take starting positions, I'm thinking maybe Fran, GG, Endrick, Rodrygo, Mendy (If he's not injured), Ceballos and Alaba could play. Also, should Mbappe start? I'm kind of torn between letting him rest for the Kairat match vs wanting to see him get 3-4 goals. Considering we can let endrick and gonzalo get minutes for the CDR and other domestic matches. We could also deploy a 2-striker formation, letting Mbappe drop deep for his role of playmaker while GG and Endrick can rotate both halves playing as the actual 9's. Also, the midfield, it si no secret that this year we have a thin midfield, so we could experiment with it a little, see what we can get away with and what we cannot. I'm thinking maybe one (or two) of Ceballos, Fran and Alaba could start. However, that being said it IS after all, A UCL MATCHDAY. So the 3 points will be a must-have so we can't take too many risks. What do we think? ",
