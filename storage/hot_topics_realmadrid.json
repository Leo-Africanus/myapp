All of us would be more frustrated and less forgiving with his behavior. \n\nAlso now some opponents will purposefully try to rile him up as they know it is easy to get reaction out of him. not to say they are not doing it currently.\n\n  \nAs fans we need to held him accountable that might give him necessary incentive to change\n\nHe can show dissent but he has to do it following the rules.
