        "content": "I think the key against Rayo will be how Valverde manages the vector flux between our defensive line and the half-space rotations. If Valverde doesn\u2019t maintain phase coherence in the back, their lateral pressing could induce an unexpected entropy spike in our build-up. Camavinga will need to align his shadow runs with Vin\u00edcius\u2019s hypothetical momentum vectors, otherwise the midfield spiral might collapse before it even completes a single cycle. On the wings, if Arda oscillates too early between zones 4 and 9, the expected xG trajectory could decohere entirely, forcing Courtois into a quantum-level intervention. Honestly, it might come down to the bench rotation angles\u2014anything below 42 degrees in stoppage time could break the emergent pattern completely.",

        "title": "About Mbapp\u00e9 and Anfield",
        "content": "Are some people seriously gonna blame Mbapp\u00e9 for recent mishaps??? It\u2019s just so pathetic, is born of player bias and indicates individual failure to recognise mistakes in Xabi\u2019s system. If you watched the build up out of the back at Anfield, it is clear to see a massive errors from how the team set up against Liverpool. As easily as you can blame Mbapp\u00e9, you can blame Vinicius for the loss. But we shouldn\u2019t dwell on such minute matters and instead look at the bigger picture to gain better insight into our problems in the big matches. However, it must be disclosed that these are all in my personal opinion having watched the disaster at Anfield from start to end.\n\n1- To start off, there\u2019s a major problem in escaping presses. Xabi played Trent for a collective total of around 10 minutes in the last two games. His first game fully back from injury was in the most hostile environment in Anfield after his confidence is already being lowered by the starting of Carvajal and Valverde over him. To put it simply, if we don\u2019t play Trent at RB, who was brilliant as allowing Liverpool to escape pressing with his passing range, it just won\u2019t work. The clumping between Valverde, Camavinga and Militao was simply ridiculous at times. Valverde and Camavinga beng desperate to escape the pressure that they found themselves in, were to hit the long balls cross field because the short passing between themselves was going absolutely nowhere.\n\n2- The over reliance on Vinicius. We can\u2019t look for the left flank everytime to create chancesfor our team. Especially at Anfield he needs someone to help relieve pressure so he can play at his absolute best- which is genuinely unstoppable. He\u2019s such a good player but if you\u2019re dribbling the ball out of the game you need to get your head into the bloody game. I see so much criticism of Mbapp\u00e9 when we have Vinicius being given the keys to drive the offence forward against Liverpool and doing jackshit with the role. The diving was flamboyant and unnecessary, he needed to just get his head entirely into the game and not try any funny business.\n\n3- Only one of Bellingham or G\u00fcler should be playing in the middle, not both. Both players have extremely different styles of plays and different talents to offer in the attack but want to occupy the same area of the pitch in possession. I think playing both sacrifices the potency of one of them so it\u2019s an \u201ceither or\u201d situation.\n\n4- Misusing Tchouameni. All I will say is that it seems he is not being found during possession to relieve some pressure even when Xabi wants to pass out the back. We\u2019ve seen from endeavours with France that Tchouameni has the eye for the pass behind when he gets on the ball. Even if we want to pass out the back Tchouameni should be a pivot we turn to because he has the physicality to hold it up and the ability to pass it up the pitch.\n\n5- Horrible substitutions. Xabi should not be waiting until the 80th minute to start substituting players. In addition, the substitutions made no impact because they had no time to. Xabi needs to bring in Gonzalo Garcia or Endrick as well because both bring energy into the match. I can remember Garcia pressing his ass off to meet Barcelona players in their own half when Real Madrid were closing out the game. The importance of energetic presence cannot be understated on modern football and Mbapp\u00e9 and Vini cannot be expected to do such after 70 minutes.\n\n6- The press. Is there even a press in big matches??? Has Xabi told the forwards to save energy for non existent counter attacks? I believe one of Mbapp\u00e9 and Vinicius should be pressing in each defence and the role should be left up to them to decide in lieu of commanded rotation pre and mid match. \n\nTLDR: There are major changes that must be made to roles in personnel and system that have been negatively impacting performances on the big stage. It must be recognised and your mindset needs to change if you\u2019re still riding the Mbapp\u00e9 hate train.",

        "content": "  As no surprise to anyone, we are not in our best form right now. Although, I believe we will get much better. However, evidently there is a lack of something. Many claim we are missing a creative midfielder, while others claim we need a proper 9 in the box. I personally believe that the main issue is that we have too many similar profile players, especially in attack. We basically have three left wingers and no competent Right wingers. If I could bring someone, I would either bring a good right winger, or a proper 9 who can score set pieces which we lack so much. If you could bring someone, who would you bring? ",

I hope we can make space for his return sooner rather than later. I think Cama has had enough time to show us consistent elite form, but hasn\u2019t delivered. It might be time to give up space for this star boy. ",
