It takes one or two moments of madness or a single injury to flip their season upside down.\n\nWe still have all our knockout games ahead of us, and we have already beaten Barca this season, so that monkey is also off our back.\n\nIs there even any sense in sacking Xabi when the board has already committed to transitioning into the tactical-meta era of football?",

        "title": "There is Something Fundamentally Wrong With This Institution And It's Been Exposed",
        "content": "It's seriously concerning just how low we've fallen over the past 2 years. It's like after the double in 23/24, we've just completely and utterly forgotten the values and principles.\n\nWe won the double in 21/22 as well, thing's weren't great the years before but this time feels really off, and the main reason is the performance EVEN when we have a strong squad on paper. Why on paper? Because for some odd reason, the strongest squad is NEVER fully fit.\n\nI want to jog your memory back to the 2016/2017 season. The fact we didn't win the treble that year really ticks me off but I digress. In the 16/17 season, we effectively had 2 squads. Zidane rotated between them, and the injuries weren't as common of course counting out Bale (I feel for him icl). But more importantly, they didn't impact the squad NEARLY as much as the injuries do now.\n\nAnd that's plainly because of depth. Our starting 11 consisted of Cris, Benz, Gareth, Luka, Kroos, Case, Sergio, Pepe, Marcelo And Carva, along with Keylor in goal. Unbelievable line up. But here's the really INSANE thing. \n\nOur B team consisted of: Morata, Asensio, James, Danilo, Varane (though he was pretty much a starter too) Nacho, Kovacic, Mariano, Casilla and a few academy players.\n\nToday it could be argued we have a \"B\" team as well. The issue is that it's no longer set and stone. The injury crisis has decimated the defense and the board thinks another young defender is the way to go.\n\n  \nWe've let go of all veterans that could steer the ship, and that too in quick succession. I still cannot fathom we let Luka of all people leave so soon. We've lost experience AND hunger because I'm sorry, for players that have won 2 champions leagues, they sure as hell aren't showing it. It's baffling. \n\nPerhaps they're tired, perhaps there's something else, who knows\n\nNow our board has decided Xabi has to go because he's not getting the results. Just months ago they had decided Ancelotti was no longer getting the results and should go, coming off the back of a double AND riddled with injuries. The next coach will be someone else who they also deem inadequate. \n\nAnd a final note, Vinicius should be sold end of. He's my favorite player on the team, but his behavior has gotten to the point where nobody benefits any longer. It allows for the media to leech to the team and you best believe it affects the players even if they say it doesn't. It's impossible to avoid the noise, and speaking in the most blunt and unbiased way I possibly can. He's no longer the player that won us those 2 champions leagues, and there has been no change in attitude that would give a person faith that he can regain that form. Saudi want him its obvious, we take the money now and be done with it, or have a saga that will destabilize the team further WHILE we lose money.  \n  \nAlonso IS the man for the job. Ancelotti WAS the man for the job. We cannot make the same mistake a third time, punishing the coach for a collective issue with the institution and protecting the players who play a massive role in said issue.\n\nChange is needed now, otherwise in this modern era, we aren't gonna achieve the success we're used to.",

        "title": "2018-2025 Real Madrid: So many world class players left/declined, barely anyone was replaced properly",
        "content": "I understand that some players are impossible to replace, I totally get that. But it feels like so many times someone important leaves the squad and we don't even bother to replace him.\n\nOf course the most notorious case was Makelele.\n\nIn the most recent future, we had:\n\n* Cristiano Ronaldo, our best player and goalscorer ever left in 2018 and was replaced by... Mariano Diaz. Honestly I don't even know what the plan was back then, considering Benzema had his worst season ever in terms of scoring in 2017/18 and Bale was constantly injured. Maybe they had too much faith on Asensio, Isco and Vazquez and expected them to step up as important starters? A year later we bought Hazard who... yeah. We were just lucky that Vini was helpful since he was a kid and just happened to become world class a few years later.\n* Bale himself declined a lot since 2018 and we never bothered to get an actual RW. We had temporary replacements like Vazquez, Rodrygo, Valverde, occasionaly Brahim and now Mastantuono, but none of these players are Real Madrid starter level at this position.\n* Benzema left one season after winning the Ballon d'Or and was replaced by... Joselu. No disrespect to him, was massive against Bayern, but completely different profile and 1% of the player Benzi was. I suppose his real replacement is Mbappe now?\n* Marcelo declined heavily in 2018 and in 2019 we signed a completely different LB. Who worked well for a couple of seasons, but he's too injury prone and basically a negative in our attack. I think the real Marcelo replacement is Carreras now, maybe some people will disagree with this, I just never rated Mendy that highly.\n* In 22/23 we had four really good CBs: Nacho, Militao, Alaba and Rudiger. Now all 3 left are extremely injury prone and some have declined a lot, while Nacho of course has left. Our only replacement for all 4 has been Huijsen now, who certainly lacks physical/aerial qualities and he's more comparable to Alaba on that aspect. Of course Asencio is there from the academy.\n* And now the worst of all. Modric and Kroos, two of the best CMs ever left and they weren't replaced by anyone of the same position AND role. Bellingham is same position, different role. Guler is similar role, different position. Instead we spent 100m on two teenagers from South America in two seasons.\n\nSo, 10 world class players who have left/declined heavily in the last 7 years, have been replaced by: Mariano, Vazquez/Asensio/Brahim, Joselu, Mendy, Huijsen and nobody. Three guys that were back-up/3rd choice in our previous squads, one guy from Lyon, one guy from Bournemouth.\n\nObviously Mendy and Joselu have been great at times and Huijsen could be great soon, but the point is that we didn't really try to replace some of our best players ever.\n\nThe only decent 1 to 1 replacements have been:\n\n* Navas to Courtois (upgrade imo). Also Courtois to Lunin when he was injured. We've been blessed with keepers\n* Casemiro to Tchouameni (not that similar, but still a decent move)\n* One of Modric/Kroos getting replaced by one of Jude/Fede (both are great as players, the problem is that a midfield of Tchou - Fede - Jude lacks control)\n* Benzema to Mbappe in terms of goalscoring, it remains to be seen in terms of overall impact (trophies etc)\n* *Maybe in the future*, Carvajal to Trent, we'll see\n\nAnd yes, I know we aren't an Oil club and we don't have unlimited funds. But you can't go out there buying Brazilian teenagers when your club DESPERATELY needs reinforcements on certain positions. You can't watch two of the greatest passers of all time leaving the same position empty and just hope that a 18 year old AM/RW from Turkey or Ceballos are gonna fill the role, or that someone like Camavinga MIGHT randomly end up being good on their role.",

        "content": "Our boy had an interview with L\u2019\u00c9quipe and he said some interesting things about us, I havent seen anyone post it here so here's the translation from french:\n\n**About the players:** \n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re missing is just a connection. Between (Kylian) Mbapp\u00e9, Vin\u00edcius, (Jude) Bellingham, Rodrygo. Each one has to know what he\u2019s supposed to do on the pitch. Bellingham has to understand that he\u2019s the playmaker, not the goalscorer. Mbapp\u00e9 is the goalscorer, not the playmaker. Vin\u00edcius isn\u2019t the No. 6; he\u2019s the left winger. As soon as everyone knows what they have to do on the field, that\u2019s it, it\u2019s sorted. Because we\u2019re talking about guys who are among the ten best players in the world, and they\u2019re all on the same team.\u201d\n\n\n\n**Xabi Alonso situation:**\n\n\u201cThe coach can\u2019t do anything. He\u2019s got big names, he picks the best. After that, it\u2019s down to the players\u2026 If your teammate is better than you, you have to accept it. The problem is if you don\u2019t accept that the guy in front of you scores more goals than you. That\u2019s why you have problems when you\u2019ve got five or six great players together. Everyone\u2019s going to bring something. And in the end, the goalscorer will always be a bit more in the spotlight than the others. But he always needs the others! You can\u2019t do everything on your own.\u201d\n\n  \nIt's pretty clear he believes the ones to blame are the players and their lack of chemistry.\n\n  \nSources:  \n[https://www.footmercato.net/a8917801439453191407-karim-benzema-sait-pourquoi-le-real-est-en-pleine-crise](https://www.footmercato.net/a8917801439453191407-karim-benzema-sait-pourquoi-le-real-est-en-pleine-crise)  \n[https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Article/Grand-recit-karim-benzema-qui-peut-refuser-une-coupe-du-monde/1616285](https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Article/Grand-recit-karim-benzema-qui-peut-refuser-une-coupe-du-monde/1616285)\n\n",
