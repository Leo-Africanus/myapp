However, when Kroos left, we saw how much Real Madrid struggled to build attacks and transition the ball from defense to attack.\n\nThis is where Camavinga, Tchouam\u00e9ni, and R\u00fcdiger come into play. These three are excellent on the ball, good passers, and able to break the opponent\u2019s press with their precise passing. A lot of our quick switches and build up play are thanks to their ability to link up the play effectively. This helps solve the problem of not having dribbling wingbacks who can break the press, or a player like Kroos with his superb passing range.\n\nTchouam\u00e9ni is still young, but I really believe that, given time, he will prove to be irreplaceable.",
