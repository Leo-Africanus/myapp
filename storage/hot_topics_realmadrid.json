It's not the original source, but it's very well explained.\n\nhttps://www.lagalerna.com/ciclo-karmico-madridista/\n\nIt goes like this:\n\nStage 1 - Dictator Stage: A new trainer comes to put order, work and rigor in a relaxed team. Supporters celebrate his arrival. Mou or Capello are good examples.\n\nStage 2 - Happy stage: A new trainer comes. He usually has a deep knowledge of the club. Work and order have good results. Team wins. Del Bosque and Carlo. Zidane also.\n\nStage 3 - \"Asador\" stage: Everyone relax too much. Players stop listening to the trainer. The president is too conservative and don't make decisions. Suddenly things don't work any more. Bad results. Crisis. Apocalypse. \n\nThis cycle has been happening over the last 30 years with no exception.\n\nIt is clear that we're at \"Asador\" stage now. A new \"dictator\" is about to come.\n\nXabi Will be welcomed. ",

Meanwhile their owners have backed pretty much every signing their manager requested, even for his coaching staff. \"Yeah he was able to play Merino at ST\" .... yeah, the Merino he handpicked himself knowing how versatile he could be for his system. Meanwhile, our manager asks for Harry Kane who would suit Vini - Rodrygo's playstyles to perfection, but gets told to fuck off, Mbappe is coming and you better make him work. Backline decimated ? Just shove your midfielders there, Saliba is coming on a free in 2026 (maybe).\n\n\"Xabi Alonso will come and make us play champagne modern football, unlike this dinosaur we have\" ... the same Xabi who on his first season made 12 signings and shipped out 8 players at Leverkusen for his system to work. Yeah, good luck convincing Perez with that.\n\n Then and maybe then, y'all will stfu and put more respect on the 2 managers we had for the past 10 years, and actually give them credit for the achievements instead of saying garbage like \" It was thanks to CR7 - Benzema magic - Jude brilliance - Luck\" or whatever.\n\n  \nSo unless Perez actually changes the way he operates with transfers, those unicorn managers y'all keep glazing will NEVER work here.",

        "content": "I have been supporting Real Madrid for 19 years now. While this team has given me immense happiness and joy, unfortunately, the same can't be said for my life.\n\nSince 2017, I have been struggling. I watched this team as an escape from the reality of my life. I have failed multiple interviews that could have helped me become an Army man or an Engineer etc. but sadly I couldn't achieve those dreams.\n\nOn 10th April, I had an opportunity to turn things around, but I couldn't make it count. I don't know what the result will be, but it's heavily affecting me.\n\nI finally decided to seek help. I have been diagnosed with Insomnia and Depression.\n\nWhen they asked me about my insomnia, the source became clear, me watching football matches until 3 AM for nearly 19 years. The depression stems from my personal failures, which also began around the same time mostly in part to those sleepless nights and lifestyle that spiraled from there. \n\nI have been advised to stop watching matches in order to start the recovery process.\n\nI am 28 years old, unemployed, dealing with a bad back and facing a deadline to find a job by the end of 2025 because I have embarrassed my Parents enough already. \n\nWith these issues in front of me, I have decided to make some changes.\n\nSo, I have decided to step away. \n\nI will stop watching football until I find stability and get better.\n\nI have watched every UCL final since 2006, Every UEFA Euro final since 2008 and Every FIFA World Cup final since 2006 and countless more so I have some great memories as well. \n\nGood luck to everyone and I hope football continues to bring you the joy it brought me over the past 19 years. But for me, it\u2019s time to stop.\n\nIt took me a week of courage to write this. If anyone of you is suffering from anything, please seek help. It truly helps in the end.\n\nGoodbye, everyone.",

Also, Quique Ribes on for Loren Aguado\n\nFT - an absolutely perfect match by Castilla today, great reaction on the frustrating penalty early on in the match, our players were cold blooded killers on the counter, and an incredible individual performance by Victor with both 2 great goals and 2 great assists gave the team a comfortable victory today.

        "title": "Most of our recent success has been with 4 Midfielders on the pitch. Why do we insist on switching back to variations of the 433?",
        "content": "Last season was one of the most succesful ones in our history. We won the UCL completely unbeaten. We won La Liga with a 10 points difference, only 26 goals conceded and winning both Clasicos, while rotating for the last 6 matchdays. We won the Supercopa by outclassing Barcelona with 4-1.\n\nA very large part of this success was the 442 Diamond formation, with 4 midfielders perfectly complimenting each other: Tchouameni the destroyer, Kroos the controller, Valverde the lungs of the team and Bellingham becoming a pseudo \"9\" in attack with deep runs and an extra CM in defense. Even after Kroos retired, the logical thing should have been **directly replacing him** with Ceballos or another CM with similar qualities. But the board had completely different plans (Mbappe) and Ancelotti never even tried to bench one of the front three to switch back to the 442 diamond. I think both of them should be blamed, but on this occasion mainly the board was the problem.\n\nThe last time we won the UCL (21/22) we also did it with 4 midfileders, even if Valverde was technically a RW, he was very crucial in defense and transition and mostly functioned as an extra energetic midfielder to balance the aging and less physical Kroos-Modric duo. The start to 22/23 was very strong, with Tchouameni replacing Casemiro, while Fede stayed on the RW and was scoring like crazy. As soon as we returned back to a 433 with Vini &amp; Rodrygo as wingers, our performances dropped in big games, as did our form in the 2nd half of the season and we ended up winning only the CdR. *(Of course the formation wasn't the only reason, but that's another conversation).*\n\nThe 16/17 and 17/18 UCL wins also came with a 442 diamond and Isco playing the AM role in front of the KCM trio.\n\nEven if we go back to 11/12, the season we won La Liga while breaking the goalscoring record and we were playing amazing football (even if we didn't reach the UCL final), our RW was Di Maria. A player with incredible workrate and more of a \"wide playmaker\" than a winger like Vini or Rodrygo. So again, Mourinho's 4231 that season was much more balanced and none of our midfielders or attackers allowed large gaps when defending, unlike the current season.\n\nThe only exceptions of the rule have been the 13/14 and 15/16 UCL winning seasons with the 433 and the BBC attack. But we're talking about one of the best attacking trios ever, that were complimenting each other perfectly. Also our whole XI was crazy talanted and in-form. But every other succesful campaign (especially in the UCL) in the modern Perez era (2009-) has been with 4 midfielders or a 4231 with one winger in a much more supportive role.\n\n**What can we do now?** It won't be easy, but I think we have to say goodbye to one of our front three members. A new coach can maybe improve them and make them somehow work better, but they'll never click 100%, they are too similar to each other in terms of strengths and weaknesses. People are comparing us to PSG, but they have 2 completely two footed attackers (Dembele, Kvara), while most of their attackers are constantly switching positions, it's not the same.\n\nMbappe isn't leaving any time soon, he's Perez' golden boy. Vini had a pretty weird season, but he's still the kind of player that can win you games out of nowhere (Dortmund, City away, La Real 2nd SF etc). I think Rodrygo is the one who has to leave and that's coming from someone who loves the guy [(example)](https://www.reddit.com/r/realmadrid/comments/1itwvr9/rodrygo_silva_de_goes_appreciation_post_his_last/). He's a good player, with some amazing moments for the club, but he's simply not consistent enough to be a Real Madrid starter for 50+ games per season. It's not about his position either, he has 0 G&amp;A on his last 4 games as a LW, he isn't much better as a LW or AM in Brazil. It's just how he is as a player, like it or not.\n\nTchou - Fede - Jude aren't going nowhere from our midfield, so we should either sign a world class AM that can play between the lines and be our creator (Wirtz?) or a good ball playing CM and return Jude to his AM position of 23/24. Of course **going back to the 442 won't automatically fix all our issues**, we still have to buy new fullbacks and defenders in general, we can all agree on that. But it will be a good start.\n\nThe 442 is also better suited for future prospects. Spain produces far more quality AMs or CMs, compared to world class traditional or inverted wingers. Same goes for our academy, look at Nico Paz or Arribas (a few years back). Arda will be far more useful on the #10, compared to when he plays on the right. I feel like even Endrick will benefit more from that kind of set-up, as opposed to being a \"lone striker\" in a 433.\n\n**TL;DR:** Most of our success in the last 16 years happened with 4 midfielders, including last season. We should sell one of our attackers (most likely Rodrygo) and bring back the 442, which will make our whole team much more balanced, while it's also suited for most of our players.",

        "title": "In Defense of Rodrygo, the whole right side of the attack has been really poor since the Carvajal injury",
        "content": "I've been reading a lot of comments on this thread and this post isn't to have a go at anyone even though I wholeheartedly disagree that Rodrygo needs to go anywhere, but I am also one of the first people to realize that Rodrygo seems to fade in games a lot after 50 to 60 minutes. \n\nHe seems to always start very strong and then just disappears whereas Vini is always dangerous till the final whistle which is why when a sub needs to be made in attack Ancelotti usually takes him out instead of Vini.\n\nOne thing I think we have all forgotten to take into account however is that he is missing arguably the best right back in the world on his side for pretty much the whole season. The truth is that Rodrygo, Valverde and every player on the right side of the attack plays significantly better when Carvajal is on the pitch.\n\nThe truth is while Vazquez is decent going forward which is expected as a former right winger, he's a complete liability defensively and the whole team suffers for it as there defensive output all triple due to the major gaps he constantly leaves and his inability to actually mark anyone. \n\nYou just simply have to watch any highlights of him vs Carvajal defending to see this. The reason the left side is better is also for this precise reason, Mendy and even Fran are SIGNIFICANTLY better than Vazquez defensively so Vini rarely has to do as much defending which means he can focus more on attack.\n\nObviously there's other issues in the team beyond this but I'm just saying to not be too harsh on Rodrygo. This is also why I worry about signing Trent now because he cannot do what Carvajal does defensive wise and honestly I don't think Trent is also that much better than Carvajal offensively.\n\nWhat i do know is this is going to have to start playing some serious high pressing football from the attack if we do sign Trent.",

I am unsure what to really believe at this point because I am not sure what\u2019s going on in Perez mind at this moment because we have had such a limited squad even since Zidane\u2019s last season in 2020/2021 season with 60 injuries, mainly lacking defenders which is the bigger issue and now the new issue is needing a creative midfielder who can direct this midfield and provide solid balance to the team, but I feel Perez isn\u2019t willing to splash the cash for quality players these days and we rely on the free agents because rumor says he wants to sign Saliba as a free agent in 2027, I feel like we may end up getting gassed up and get played once next season, only new addition may end up being Trent for free, and this team will reach new lows next season if the board doesn\u2019t act and keeps this same exact squad, honestly I may be preparing myself mentally for Europa League or Conference league on Thursday nights for 2026/2027 season, I have somewhat lost faith in this board with their blind love for signing free agents and especially having only signed Mbappe for free last season and no Nacho, Joselu or Kroos replacement.
