        "content": "I think these statements are all that's needed to be said on the topic. I'm posting this as an answer to everyone who thinks that the youngsters have been done wrong etc. (including myself at some points)\n\n**The question**: You said that G\u00fcler was fine and ready to play the other day, but how are you handling the situation with such a young player, I'd like to know that. Do you expect more patience and work from him, or does the player come to your office himself to request advice?\n\n**Ancelotti**: All the players can come and talk to me. I speak to him, Endrick and all of the young players on a daily basis. I've read that there is an issue with G\u00fcler? But it hasn't got here yet. He's working hard and wants to play, like everyone else, but it's a process for him and for all the young players like we did with Rodrygo, Valverde and Vini Jr. He needs time to join the best squad in the world because the players are very good and the competition is fierce. Everyone understands that and if they don't, they should.\n\nI spend every day with the young players and I don't want to see players who are happy when they're not playing. I want players who work hard, who learn and who want to play. I think that's normal, but this is a small part of their time. They spend much more time with other people and I don't know if these other people have the same idea and are thinking the same way that I do about them: that they improve and that they can soon play for Real Madrid. This is a lack of communication.",

        "content": "Since when is Real Sociedad this aggressive in terms of fouling, pullings shirts and dirty tackles? That tackle from Kubo on Fran, was very f*cking nasty...reminded me the one on Kylian from that Espanyol scumbag that also scored. The 2 fouls on Endrick that their defenders went for a bodyshot instead for the ball and that \"dive\" from Vini (not a dive but he tried to get foul), on the replay their defender put his whole hand to cut him off. (Im not saying its a penalty, but in the last few months we've seen easier penalties given). Also foul on Arda at 44' the defender stepped on him. And as im typing, of course the first yellow its on us, on the first foul by Asencio. (Yes it was a yellow btw)",
