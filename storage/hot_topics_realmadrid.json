        "content": "#FT: JUVENIL A 5:2 OM\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#UEFA YOUTH LEAGUE \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:**\n\n1:0 Thiago Pitarch 17'\n\n1:1 Mohamed Baradji 25'\n\n2:1 Anis Doubal (own goal) 27'\n\n2:2 Tadjidine Mmadi (penalty) 42'\n\n3:2 Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (penalty) 53'\n\n4:2 Diego Mart\u00ednez 'Beto' 80'\n\n5:2 Adri P\u00e9rez 90'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - kickoff, vamos! \n\n\u26bd 17' - GOLLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - Arnu steals the ball from their defensive midfielder, and quickly plays it to Thiago at the edge of the box. He takes a few quick touches to create space, and then cuts his shot across, low into the far corner\n\n\u26bd 25' - goal for OM - Illia punches away a free kick poorly, then their player takes a shot and it hits the post - the ball bounces to Baradji, who takes a little touch, and Joan Mart\u00ednez can't clear it off the line in time (and even then it would've bounced back into the net again), what a crazy and unfortunate goal\n\n\u26bd 27' - GOLLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - and right in the next attack, Fortea advances on the right wing - his powerful and low cross gets deflected into the near corner by Marseille's Doubal! \n\n42' - penalty for OM after a foul by Rivas \n\n\u26bd 42' - Mmadi converts\n\nHT - half time in a very open match where most dangerous situations ended up being goals on both ends - the goals we conceded were entirely avoidable, and the team needs to pay special attention to defending set-pieces better or preventing them from happening in the first place\n\n46' - 2nd half underway \n\n51' - penalty for Juvenil A after Y\u00e1\u00f1ez gets tripped in the box! \n\n\u26bd 53' - GOLLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - Y\u00e1\u00f1ez takes it himself and converts! \n\n\ud83d\udd04 59' - Rivas and Cestero off for Valde and Beto \n\n\ud83d\udd04 71' - Y\u00e1\u00f1ez off for Gabri Valero\n\n\u26bd 80' - GOLLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - golazo de Beto! free kick from around 20 metres out, and Diego Mart\u00ednez strikes it right into the top corner on the goalkeeper's side of the goal! \n\n\ud83d\udd04 83' - last subs, Ciria and Arnu off for Adri P\u00e9rez and Jacobo\n\n\u26bd 90' - GOLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - and the cherry on top, after a dribble by Gabri Valero, he crosses the ball low into the box - it gets deflected towards the far post by the defender, where Adri appears to head it into the net\n\nFT - a calm and controlled second half by the team makes the match end with a comfortable scoreline - they had OM under control defensively much more than in the first half and pounced in the decisive moments in attack. We will get to know the opponents in the Round of 16 and the possible path through the rest of the tournament on Friday\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 16:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee:** Sam Barrott (ENG) \n\n**Competition:** UEFA Youth League, Round of 32\n\n**Viewing options:** [RMTV/RM PLAY](https://play.realmadrid.com/home)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Juvenil A XI (4-3-3):** Illia Voloshyn - Diego Aguado, Mario Rivas (59' Victor Valdepe\u00f1as 'Valde'), Joan Mart\u00ednez, Jes\u00fas Fortea - Jorge Cestero (Diego Mart\u00ednez 'Beto'), Carlos D\u00edez, Thiago Pitarch - Alexis Ciria (83' Adri P\u00e9rez), Adri\u00e1n Arnuncio \u2018Arnu\u2019 (83'' Jacobo Ortega), Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (71' Gabri Valero)\n\nBench: \u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez (GK), Melvin Ukpeigbe, \u00c1lvaro Lezcano, Pol Dur\u00e1n. \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro L\u00f3pez\n",

When people talk about Real Madrid\u2019s worst signings, they mention Hazard, Jovic, Illarramendi, Woodgate, Danilo, Kaka, James, etc \u2014 but never Reinier. Not out of ignorance, but because the player is forgotten to that extent.\n\n\u20ac30 million for a player who never played a single minute for the first team is embarrassing and almost comical. Easily a top-five worst signing in the club\u2019s history.\n\nAnyways.. he\u2019s still only 24. I hope he manages to find himself again. Maybe he\u2019ll get another chance to play in Europe.",

        "title": "How Simone Inzaghi would be an underrated alternative for Real Madrid",
        "content": "I think Simone Inzaghi should be a serious contender for a future Real Madrid manager, if Arbeloa leaves this summer. And if not then, further ahead in the future.\n\nUnlike Tuchel, Emery, and Klopp, who are the most common names circulating, his system does not revolve around a high press, which we realistically will never get with our current squad.\n\nInstead of high pressing, he focuses on defensive shape and structure, similar to how Ancelotti would ask our CB\u2019s and Mendy to stay back while allowing our front three more freedom. His system is filled with quick vertical football and counters, which would suit our pace and speed offensively. Most Real Madrid fans probably thought of him as a manager while watching the Inter Milan vs Barcelona matchup in the Champions League. Last but not least, his system does not revolve around possession, which helps hide the fact that we clearly lack a tempo setter and have more of a physical than technical midfield.\n\nHe is extremely pragmatic in the way he sets his teams up and truly a big game manager. Having taken an aging Inter Milan side to two Champions League finals in four years, drawn against us with Al Hilal, and even beaten Manchester City with them. His personality is calm and collected and likely would not cause the same friction as managers like Conte or Tuchel.\n\nLooking at the managerial market for next summer, he is probably the top level coach least dependent on high pressing football and heavy possession, aside from Ancelotti after the Brazil job. For those reasons, I think these factors make him a realistic fit for Real Madrid.\n\nThoughts?\n\nEDIT:\n\nIt seems many people claim that he has underachieved in the league, and while I understand that argument, Serie A is far less predictable than La Liga. Even Carlo Ancelotti, who had an amazing European career with AC Milan, did not dominate Serie A in the same way.\n\nAs for comparisons with managers such as Tuchel and Klopp, the intention of this post was to highlight tactical compatibility with our current squad. I believe Inzaghi could start winning with only minor additions, whereas the others would likely require a full rebuild for heavy pressing system like gegenpressing. I personally cannot see Klopp returning to management anytime soon, and I do not believe Tuchel would be willing to work here given his previous tensions with mbappe at PSG and potentially with Bellingham in England (depending on how the World Cup goes and whether he starts regularly).",

        "content": "I think it is obvious we have too many similar profiles, but this area is just overwhelmed. Bellingham, Brahim, Mastantuono, Guler and soon Nico Paz. We have too many players who thrive the best at that position. And the other problem is that they perform horribly if put at a different position. Bellingham hasn\u2019t been the same since he was given defensive responsibility and was dropped deeper. Guler has amazing vision, but has little impact when playing deep in the midfield. Brahim and Mastantuono are bench players, but who are not quite good at wingers to constantly play there. Brahim will probably be sold and Mastantuono may get loaned out. And most importantly, Guler and Bellingham can\u2019t work together which will definitely be hard to deal with.",

How would you set up?",

        "title": "The Hidden Cost of the \u201cBaby Galacticos\u201d Project",
        "content": "\u201cReal Madrid\u2019s decline over the last 18 months goes beyond tactics or a manager. It\u2019s not one player that is the issue. It\u2019s not one bad transfer window. It\u2019s a variety of different reasons and some of the cultural issues at board level weigh heavy. \n\nI can\u2019t help but think about the \u201cdelayed bill\u201d from a squad building model that looked ideal even just a few years ago. \n\nThe Youth Transfer Policy was a resounding success but has now become part of the current decline.\n\nThe youth policy or \u201cBaby Galacticos\u201d optimized for talent + resale. The board went with the \u201ccream rises to the top\u201d philosophy but never cut out duplicative roles and skill sets. Forcing managers to put round pegs in square holes.\n\nJoselu is one example. A journeyman who played at seven different clubs in Spain, England, and Germany before finally returning to his dream club. That journey gave him perspective. He knew his role and knew what he could provide to the team. He didn\u2019t take the RM chance for granted. \n\nLuka Modric, another example. Would he be signed today given the new policy? 27-years-old from a Premier League club for big money yet not a commercial super star? The policy would have rejected the most decorated player in RM history.\n\nElite talent isn\u2019t enough. You still need veterans with perspective, role players who accept limits and know their limits. Many within the squad aren\u2019t as good as we thought they were. The reality is some hard decisions need to be made this summer. They may not be good decisions from a commercial perspective, but the right decisions from a sporting perspective. This is salvageable. The model can still work but it needs to be less stringent and open to different profiles: technical profiles, age curves, role expectations, etc.\u201d\n\nThought this was a really good piece that sums up our problem perfectly and would give the full article a read if you have the time.",

        "title": "Clarifying Arda\u2019s Situation",
        "content": "You might think that, as Turks, we sometimes exaggerate the Arda issue. We know he is still developing, he is only 20 years old, and we believe his level will rise much higher. However, as Arda keeps playing in unnatural positions, we clearly see that he will get used to play as a 6 (DLP) or an 8 and these unnatural positions will cause Arda to lose the qualities that a true number 10 should have. This pisses us off. \n\nWe also see that Jude\u2019s ego about playing in that role as number 10, and his influence in the team in terms of hierarchy and dressing-room dynamics, is naturally much stronger than Arda\u2019s. That is very clear.\n\nOtherwise, we do like Jude\u2019s game, his endless tempo and energy. But Jude is a pure talented number 8, but he is not more creative or more technical than Arda. We see this clearly, and that\u2019s why we get frustrated. Very understandable.\n\nWe all believe Arda is being treated unfairly by not being played in his natural position. And we know very well that at this age, this situation will blunt his number 10 instincts and skills and qualities. That\u2019s why, personally, I want him to leave Real Madrid, because I know and I am pretty sure he cannot compete with Jude who has such a strong impact on other players in the dressing room, on the club hierarchy, and also because of his desire to play as a number 10 there. It is impossible for Arda to compete with Jude in those aspects. Arda is a different material and has a different naive character.\n\nYou remember how unwanted Modri\u0107 was when he first arrived, right? Arda is neither Modri\u0107 nor Kroos. We believe that if Arda had played many matches as a number 10 until the ages of 23\u201324, his ceiling would be completely different. Sadly, it looks like this will not happen at Real Madrid.\n\nBy the way, because of Arda, I think almost half of T\u00fcrkiye now supports and follows Real Madrid like crazy. Unbelievable.\n\nNo matter whether Arda makes it at Real Madrid or at another elite club, we will always back him when he is treated unfairly or forced to play in unnatural positions, because he is also a national asset for our national team, just like Kenan Y\u0131ld\u0131z, Can Uzun, Hakan \u00c7alhano\u011flu, and others. And believe us, when Arda plays poorly, we Turks criticize him with sniper-level precision, even more harshly than many Madridistas do.\n\nOur very understandable objection is Arda\u2019s unnatural role in the team. He is not a 6 or an 8. This is unfair. He is a pure, naturally talented number 10. His football IQ is different, and we need to wait to see his true ceiling until he is 23\u201324 or even 25. Modri\u0107 joined Real Madrid when he was 25. Please remember this.\n\nYou are comparing 28\u201329\u201330-year-old Modri\u0107 to a 20-year-old Arda who is constantly forced to play out of position. Do you really think this is fair? Of course not. And yet, Arda still produces very strong statistics. Just check them out.\n\nI also want you to look at the 11 matches at the beginning of the season under Alonso, before Jude returned from injury. It worked. As far as I remember, Real Madrid did not lose any of those matches. The system was working.\n\nAnd honestly, it is unfortune that these young players in the squad did not get the chance to spend much more time alongside mature, football-focused leaders like Modri\u0107 and Kroos and players without childish egos. There are almost no mature and selfless figures left in the squad who can truly guide these young star prospects. On the contrary, there are even pointless internal cliques within the team, and we clearly saw this during the Alonso situation.\n\nHopefully, Real Madrid can still be a big surprise in both the UCL and La Liga. Because Real Madrid is just Real Madrid. All it needs is chemistry, stability, and clarity in player roles and positions.\n\nHala Madrid!",

        "content": "He is the one player I had hoped would make the jump by now. He's had so many opportunities but he just can't seem to focus. He has all the tools to be a great defensive midfielder: he has an insane motor, he can tackle, he can shoot from far, he can pass, he can dribble... I don't know why he hasn't become the player we all envisioned. Is it because he likes partying? Is it because he's injury prone? I really hope that for our sake he turns it around. I do think that he has a very high ceiling as a player, but the floor is pretty abysmal.  At this point I'm open to the team selling him, but he's the one player I'm most scared of losing because he has shown flashes of greatness and it would suck for him to become a world class player for another team after all the opportunities he had here.
