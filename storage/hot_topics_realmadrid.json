That they don\u2019t see the real issue - being our lack of defensive players. \n\nWe have a youth team that gets no trust, what kind of message does that send to younger players? We have Asencio who has showed game after game that he deserves a spot in the starting eleven, yet he\u2019s benched. We have to watch Lucas Vazquez make a fool out of himself week after week, my dead grandmother could defend better - I\u2019m sure someone in Castilla could do better than that, but no\u2026\n\nThe board and management has gone mad, and it shows in Carlo\u2019s press conferences lately\u2026 to blame the referees after yesterday\u2019s game won\u2019t get us anywhere, they need to wake up\u2026",

        "content": "Many of us saw comments about the situation with Mbappe. Some of them talked about pressure from the board to play Mbappe no matter what. The other were talking about Mbappe's slow start, and that he will start playing well no matter what. I can understand Carlo's decisions about Mbappe. Indeed, if Vini and Mbappe manage to find chemistry and a way of playing together, that would be awesome. Endrick is still super young and he will get his chances. \n\nOn the other hand, there is no way that the board or anyone is pressuring Ancelotti to play Vasquez on RB no matter what. It sounds absurd that we do not have better natural RBs/LBs from the academy. I believe Carlo and only Carlo is not letting them play. Even if you are the biggest doubter of this statement, look at what happened to Raul Asencio. He is way better than Tchouameni in the CB role, yet, Carlo's favoritism of the players is above everything. In addition, LB is nowhere better. Both Mendy and Garia are far from Real Madrid's level. \n\nI don't understand Carlo's fear of youngsters. How can somebody play worse than Vasquez? Do we really want a manager who lacks the ability to develop youngsters in an era where we are rebuilding the team? The same thing is happening with Modric. He is sacrificing the development of youngsters giving Modric every other game 90 minutes of playtime. ",

        "title": "Our results this season compared to top managers",
        "content": "It seems like 10 trophies in 3 seasons won by Ancelotti isn't enough to be trusted by a subreddit full of armchair football experts. So maybe a comparison of this season's results will put some light on how deluded this fanbase has become recently:\n\n*Season 24/25 all competitions*\n\nManager | Games | Won | Drawn | Lost\n---------|----------|----------|-----------|--------\nAncelotti | 24 | 15 | 4 | 5\nFlick | 23 | 17 | 2 | 4\nSimeone | 24 | 16 | 5 | 3\nXabi Alonso | 24 | 16 | 6 | 2\nGuardiola | 24 | 12 | 5 | 7\nArteta | 24 | 14 | 7 | 3\nMotta | 22 | 9 | 12 | 1\nDe Zerbi | 15 | 9 | 3 | 3\n\nAll these names were mentioned now or earlier as a clear step-up from Carlo \"Dinosaur with dementia\" Ancelotti, or just as names we should look on to when talking about world class managers. But are their results much better? No, they aren't. Did they have to face 27 injuries in the first squad since the start of the season, like Carlo did? No, only Flick and Guardiola faced a lot of injuries (but still not as many) and their results are similar to ours.\n\nBut if you read some posts on r/realmadrid, you'll be thinking that Ancelotti has some kind of an abysmal record this season, and that coaches like Xabi or Arteta would certainly do wonders in Madrid. This is based on absolutely nothing.\n\nIf you want to fire a manager who got 10 trophies in 3 seasons, including 2x UCL title, when we still have a chance for every trophy this season, you're just lacking spine and faith. This isn't video game and having great players doesn't mean the club will trash every team 4-0, the season is always full of ups and downs and it was like that even with Zidane winning 3 UCLs in a row. Stop being delusional and start actually SUPPORTING the club, have some fucking faith. We really don't need more plastics who turn their backs on the club, manager and players every time we lose some points. There are a lot of them already, and we as a sub should do better.",
