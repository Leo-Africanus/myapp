        "content": "COMUNICADO OFICIAL: \n\nReal Madrid C. F. expresses its satisfaction with today's Supreme Court ruling, which once again finds in favour of our club against LaLiga. \n\nThis ruling fully confirms the arguments put forth by Real Madrid against the illegal statutory amendment promoted by LaLiga in 2015. This illegal amendment altered the distribution of the clubs' audiovisual rights. \n\nThe Supreme Court has declared null and void the Second Additional Provision of LaLiga's Statutes, incorporated in 2015 without legal authorisation and aimed at altering the distribution of audiovisual revenues for the 2015-2016 season outside the scope of the law.  \n\n\nAs a result of this nullity, the valid distribution for that season must be that established by the Statutes at the time: \n\n\\* 60% of the revenue for First Division clubs. \n\n\\* 40% for Second Division clubs. \n\n\\* Equal distribution among all clubs within each category. \n\nTherefore, the applicable legal distribution entails the payment of approximately 88 million euros in additional funds, which were illegally withheld, to the clubs that played in the Second Division in the 2015-2016 season: Alav\u00e9s, Albacete, Alcorc\u00f3n, Almer\u00eda, Bilbao Athletic, C\u00f3rdoba, Elche, Gimn\u00e0stic de Tarragona, Girona, Huesca, Legan\u00e9s, Llagostera, Lugo, Mallorca, Mirand\u00e9s, Numancia, Osasuna, Ponferradina, Real Oviedo, Tenerife, Real Valladolid and Real Zaragoza.  \nIt also means that Real Madrid will receive the amount it was legally entitled to, some 8.8 million euros, of which it was also unlawfully deprived. \n\nThis ruling by the Supreme Court restores legality and ensures that decisions affecting Spanish professional football are always taken with full respect for the law and transparency.  \nThe Supreme Court's ruling completely dismisses the appeal filed by LaLiga and ratifies in full the ruling already made in favour of Real Madrid by the National High Court. \n\nThis ruling is of fundamental importance for the economic interests of the clubs that were then playing in the Second Division and for Real Madrid itself. \n\nWith this ruling, the Supreme Court confirms that Real Madrid and the aforementioned clubs were unlawfully damaged by LaLiga's actions.

Guler and Bellingham as CM or even both CAMs if we are dominating possession. Vini and Mbappe up top, me personally I would shock everyone and put Mbappe as LW and start Brahim or Gonzalo as RW. ",

You can feel that the current version of the player is \u201cvery dimmed and depressed\u201d and I notice it in his facial expressions\u2026 in his reactions to what happens on the field, especially when celebrating with teammates, or when he misses chances. You feel he\u2019s much less energetic than he used to be. There\u2019s a clear coldness in his current demeanor \u2014 when he talks to players, when he argues with referees\u2026 and that\u2019s unfortunate, especially since he\u2019s one of the team\u2019s leaders, and I've always considered him the heart and soul of the team. \n\nI don\u2019t believe everything that\u2019s being said about a conflict between him and Alonso. I know the press will write just for the sake of writing\u2026 It would be easy for Alonso to bench him and replace him with another player (with all the options available) if he wasn\u2019t satisfied with his level or behavior. But there\u2019s definitely something going on, and I hope I\u2019m wrong.\n\nAm I the only one who feels this way?",

        "title": "WE ARE 3 SIGNINGS AWAY FROM DOMINATING EUROPE",
        "content": "A long read but worth it in my opinion.\n\nI already know this post is going to get downvoted into the core of the earth by Player FC fans, but this is for the people who love Real Madrid , not a few individual players.\n\nThis is for those of us who want the strongest possible team, the healthiest dressing room, and the most complete squad to dominate Europe for years.\n\nBefore I talk about the signings, I want to get two things CLEAR \u2014 the two topics that trigger the comment section the most.\n\n\n---\n\n1. SELL VINI\n\nYes, I said it.\n\nI love Vini. We all do. But we have to be honest: Vini shines only when the entire team is built around him \u2014 when he receives endless touches, endless transitions, endless 1v1s.\n\nBut in a tactically structured elite team, when he isn\u2019t the focal point, he becomes\u2026 mid.\nNot bad. Not great. Just not the right profile.\n\nHe needs chaos to thrive; Madrid is moving toward control, structure, and collective superiority.\n\nAnd beyond the tactical fit, the dressing room harmony matters.\nThis season was going perfectly until  El Cl\u00e1sico and you know the rest. We don\u2019t need drama, we don\u2019t need distractions, and we don\u2019t need a player who requires the team to revolve around him in order to hit his ceiling.\n\nIf we can generate \u20ac180M+ for him?\nThat\u2019s a W for the club, financially and tactically.\n\n\n\n\n2. LOAN G\u00dcLER\n\nI adore Arda. He is special. But not there yet. \n\nBut he needs minutes, physical development, and responsibility \u2014 things he won\u2019t consistently get if he's our bench option.\n\nRight now, players like Paz and Franco simply offer more physicality and defensive reliability as backups behind our starters.\n\nLoan G\u00fcler to a UCL-level club where he starts every week, let him grow into the monster we all know he will be. If we keep Arda and loan Franco, fine \u2014 but one of them needs to go play a lot of  minutes next season.\n\n\n---\n\nTHE 3 SIGNINGS THAT COMPLETE US\n\n1. Nico Schlotterbeck\n\nI already explained this in detail here:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/realmadrid/s/CW0ZfG9UIO\n\nBut in short:\n\nElite anticipation\n\nBall-carrying ability and elite passing range.\n\nLeft-footed CB who gives balance\n\nLeader mentality\n\nGood in air.\n\nStrong tackler.\n\nPerfect complement to Milit\u00e3o.\n\nHe is a complete CB.\n\nHe is the profile that transforms a defense from \u201cvery good\u201d to unbreakable.\n\n\n---\n\n2. A CENTRAL BALL-PROGRESSOR (THE REAL KROOS SUCCESSOR)\n\nThe last matches showed everything:\nCamavinga as a deep receiver and ball progressor changed our entire rhythm.\nBut the problem? He is inconsistent, and his availability is unreliable.\n\nWe need a secure, consistent, line-breaking midfielder who can receive under pressure, carry forward, and connect all phases of play.\n\nZubimendi was perfect but gone.\nVitinha, Enzo \u2014 unattainable.\n\nSo let\u2019s look at the realistic market:\n\n\n1. Adam Wharton\n\nGreat passer\n\nGood reading of play\n\nInjury record is a issue.\n\nhe is not a \u20ac100M certainty yet.\n\n\n\n\n2. Angelo Stiller\n\nA Kroos-type tempo controller\n\nExceptional at finding vertical lanes\n\nCould be the perfect affordable solution if we don\u2019t go all-in.\n\n\n\n\n3. Elliot Anderson\n\nThis is the one.\n\nA player with no weakness.\nThink Bellingham, but operating deeper and progressing through both passing AND carrying.\n\nElite press resistance\n\nElite engine\n\nElite carrying\n\nElite passing\n\nTactical intelligence\n\nChampions League level already\n\n\nYes, he will cost \u20ac100M+.\nBut some signings are worth every cent \u2014 like Bellingham, Rice, Enzo, Caicedo.\nThis is that category: the signing you never regret.\n\nIf we want dominance, Anderson should be the one.\n\n\n\n3. A BOX STRIKER (THE FINAL PIECE OF THE PUZZLE)\n\nLet\u2019s be brutally honest:\n\nWe desperately need a true No. 9.\nSomeone who lives in the box, attacks crosses, scores headers, punishes low blocks, and gives us the physical edge we currently lack.\n\nWith Trent and \u00c1lvaro Carreras, we will have elite crossing.\nBut right now, we have nobody inside the box to finish those chances.\n\nThis is what is holding the entire attack back.\n\n\n\n\nHaaland? Dream. Impossible.\n\nHe will never coexist with Mbapp\u00e9.\nForget it.\n\n\nHarry Kane\n\nThe perfect tactical fit.\n\nLink-up play\n\nIntelligence\n\nBox movement\n\nFinishing\n\nLeadership\n\n\nBut he\u2019s likely renewing. And age is a concern (but still 3 elite years minimum).\n\n\n\n\nOsimhen\n\nPhysical monster.\nElite aerial presence.\nBut spending \u20ac100M on him is a huge risk.\n\n\n\n\nShort-term functional options\n\nThese are actually smart, realistic, sensible.\n\nMarcus Thuram\n\nStrong, hardworking, good in tight spaces.\n\nMateta\n\nThis is my favourite bridge option.\n\nFree agent\n\nLow wages\n\nPhysical presence like Joselu\n\nAttacks crosses relentlessly\n\nWon\u2019t block future superstar striker signings\n\n\nA perfect temporary solution until our long-term project arrives.\n\n\n---\n\nFuture No. 9s (in 1\u20132 years)\n\nBenjamin \u0160e\u0161ko\n\nWoltemade\n\nSamu Omorodion\n\nHugo Ekitike\n\n\nThese are the strikers of tomorrow.\nBut they aren\u2019t ready today.\nSo we need someone NOW who gives us the box presence Mbapp\u00e9 needs to fully explode.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CONCLUSION\n\nWith:\n\nNico Schlotterbeck\n\nAnderson/Stiller\n\nA true box No. 9\n\n\n\u2026Real Madrid becomes the most complete team in Europe.\n\nWe already have:\n\nMbapp\u00e9\n\nBellingham\n\nValverde\n\nCamavinga\n\nTchouam\u00e9ni\n\nTrent \n\nMilit\u00e3o\n\nCourtois\n\nA golden generation. \n\n\nWe are literally three signings away from building a dynasty that can dominate Europe for the next 5\u20137 years.\n\nThis is not about hating players.\nThis is about building the best version of Real Madrid \u2014 a team greater than any individual.\n\nAnd I will always choose Real Madrid over Player FC.\n\nPeople will say: \u201cBut we can\u2019t afford these signings.\u201d\nYes, we absolutely can. Easily.\n\nIf we make tough but correct sporting decisions, the finances line up perfectly.\n\nMarket Values of Potential Outgoings\n\nVin\u00edcius Jr \u2013 \u20ac150M\n\nRodrygo \u2013 \u20ac80M\n\nBrahim D\u00edaz \u2013 \u20ac40M\n\nFerland Mendy \u2013 \u20ac? \n\nCeballos \u2013 \u20ac?\n\n\nConservative total: \u20ac270M\n\n\n---\n\nCOST OF THE THREE TARGET SIGNINGS\n\n1. Nico Schlotterbeck \u2014 \u20ac40M\n\nHe has 1 year left on his contract and wants to leave.\nDortmund cannot demand \u20ac60+M anymore.\nA \u20ac40M deal is the realistic zone.\n\n2. Elliot Anderson \u2014 \u20ac120M (max)\n\nYes, he is expensive.\nYes, he is worth it.\nA generational 8/6 hybrid who instantly elevates our midfield.\n\nA signing on the level of Rice,Caicedo,Enzo,Bellingham.\n\n\nElite talents cost elite money.\n\n3. A Box CF \u2014 Remaining Budget\n\nAfter the above two deals (~\u20ac160M), we still have:\n\n\u20ac110M+ available\n\nFinancially, we are absolutely fine.",
