        "content": "Spreading the play, opening up the field, forcing the opposition to shift, this is all possible from these players with the ease and accuracy of the long ball. Beckham had a very rough season with injuries and losing motivation, but with the title race very much on and his qualities needed, he rose to the occasion training well and winning Fabio Capello's trust. with 8 matches left he had an instant impact with 4 assists, but most importantly opening up space with his dangerous passes. After tough years of the gal\u00e1cticos, he pushed on in the end and helped give Madrid a much needed title win.\n\nTrent tearing his Lcl two seasons ago and then forcing a quick recovery last season to help win the league title with Liverpool and secure a free transfer to Madrid is now needing to recover properly. He is here to stay for 6 years, so we needed to give him time to properly recover. Now with 15 la Liga matches left, I have no doubt he will be a key piece in elevating this Madrid team. Vini spreading wide, Mbappe making runs in behind, and Jude/ Valverde ready to win the second balls or attack the center of the field we will see a very different Madrid side. Just look at Liverpool from being an easy title winner to struggling to qualify for the champions league. Salah with 47 g+a, now completely disconnected with no service in dangerous space with only 9 g+a.\n\nTrent getting that well needed recovery and will be key now in the later stages of the season.",

        "content": "(Just to be clear, this is what I feel about the current state of the team. Not to take a shot against anyone.)\n\nThe last two Champions League wins changed how many people talk about Real Madrid. A lot of fans and media now say that Madrid\u2019s style is to suffer. They say we sit back, absorb pressure, and survive until a moment appears. This idea ignores our history and ignores the context of those wins. From La Decima to the three peat era, Madrid did not define itself by suffering. We defined ourselves by control, confidence, and fear. Opponents feared us before the match even started. During games, we imposed our rhythm and personality. Only Bayern and peak Barcelona could truly say they could outplay us consistently. Even then, those games felt like battles between equals. Our goalkeepers were important, but they were rarely the main story every week. The recent Champions League titles came at a very different moment. The squad was aging. Key players were injured or leaving. The team was clearly rebuilding. In that situation, choosing a more conservative approach made sense. It was logical to protect the team and rely on experience and discipline. That approach was supposed to be temporary. The problem is that it became accepted as our identity. Struggling and sitting deep is now defended as Madrid DNA. That is not true. That style is closer to Atletico Madrid than to Real Madrid. What makes it worse is that we are not only suffering against elite teams. It would be understandable to be outplayed by Manchester City, Liverpool, or maybe last season\u2019s PSG. But we are also being dominated by mid table teams. We struggle to keep the ball. Our attackers can barely connect three passes under pressure. We look uncomfortable in possession. In the past, players like Isco, Casemiro, Toni Kroos, and Luka Modric could escape any press. They used quick short passes and smart movement. They turned pressure into control. That quality is missing now. This is not only a tactical issue. It is also about standards. We need to stop accepting mediocrity because trophies were won. Winning should not silence criticism. Players must be called out for poor performances. Diva attitudes are part of the problem, but so is a lack of visible improvement. We signed some of the most exciting young talents in football. Many of them have stopped developing. Yet they are still treated like superstars. That is dangerous for a club like Madrid. Real Madrid has never been about comfort. It has always been about demanding more. Suffering can happen in football. It should never be the goal or the identity. If we accept that suffering is our style, we lower the standards that made this club great. We need to reject that narrative and demand football that reflects our history. ",
