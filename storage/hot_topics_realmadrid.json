Our team will strengthen its defensive line with a young talent who, at 20 years old, is already a Spanish international and has played professionally in Italy's Serie A and the Premier League.\n\nComing from Bournemouth, the center-back is one of the nominees for the Premier League's best young player for the 2024-25 season.\n\nHuijsen made his debut for the Spanish national team last March. He came through the youth ranks at M\u00e1laga and in 2021 signed for Juventus, where he made his first-team debut in a match against AC Milan. He later spent half a season on loan at Roma before finally joining Bournemouth.s=46",

        "content": "**Let\u2019s get one thing straight:** we didn\u2019t lose the league because Barcelona were some untouchable footballing gods.  \nWe lost it because we ghosted our own standards.\n\n---\n\n**Last season:**  \n\u2022 1 loss  \n\u2022 87 goals scored  \n\u2022 26 conceded  \n\n**This season** *(with two games left)*:  \n\u2022 6 losses  \n\u2022 74 goals scored  \n\u2022 38 conceded  \n\nThat\u2019s **13 fewer goals** and **12 more conceded** \u2014 a tidy little **25-goal swing**. Inspiring.\n\n---\n\nNow here\u2019s the part that really hurts:  \n**Four of those six losses \u2014 Valencia, Betis, Espanyol, Athletic \u2014 were by a single goal.**  \nAs in: *completely winnable*.\n\nFlip those, and that\u2019s **12 extra points**.  \nWe\u2019d be **five points clear** of Bar\u00e7a\u2019s 85 \u2014 and that\u2019s *without even touching the Clasicos*.\n\nLet\u2019s relive the heartbreak, shall we?\n\n---\n\n### **Valencia**  \n\u2022 3.5 xG, 21 shots, 9 on target. We scored *one*.  \n\u2022 They had 0.7 xG, 2 shots on target \u2014 scored *two*.  \n&gt; Played them off the pitch. Lost anyway. Magic.\n\n---\n\n### **Betis**  \n\u2022 Lost 2\u20131.  \n\u2022 Gave them 18 shots worth 2.39 xG. They needed just 3 on target to score twice.  \n\u2022 We managed 2 on target the entire game. 9 shots total. 1.13 xG.  \n&gt; Clinical... just not from us.\n\n---\n\n### **Espanyol**  \n\u2022 21 shots. 7 on target. 0 goals. xG: 1.3.  \n\u2022 They had 5 shots total, 2 on target, worth just 0.3 xG \u2014 and scored one.  \n&gt; At this point, the universe was just trolling us.\n\n---\n\n### **Athletic**  \n\u2022 Both teams took around 10 shots. 1.8 xG each.  \n\u2022 We got 5 on target and scored once.  \n\u2022 They got 3 on target and scored two.  \n&gt; Guess who took their chances?\n\n---\n\nEven if we still let Betis beat us (the toughest of the four and our sloppiest showing), just **winning the other three** \u2014 which we *should* have \u2014  \nwe\u2019d be **two points clear** of Bar\u00e7a.\n\n---\n\n### **Aggregate across Valencia, Espanyol &amp; Athletic:**  \n\u2022 **Shots:** Us: 52 | Them: 17  \n\u2022 **On Target:** Us: 21 | Them: 7  \n\u2022 **xG:** Us: 6.6 | Them: 2.8  \n\u2022 **Goals:** Us: 2 | Them: 5  \n\n---\n\n**Conversion Rates:**  \n\u2022 1 goal every **26 shots** for us  \n\u2022 1 goal every **3.4 shots** for them  \n\u2022 1 goal every **10.5 shots on target** for us  \n\u2022 1 goal every **1.4 shots on target** for them  \n\nWe **underperformed by 4.6 goals**.  \nThey **overperformed by 2.2**.\n\n---\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a missed title.  \nIt\u2019s a **manual on how to bottle one**.\n\n---\n\nSo who do we blame?  \nNot Bar\u00e7a.  \nNot the refs.  \nNot bad luck.\n\n**Us. Only us.**\n\nWe didn\u2019t drop the ball.  \n**We slammed it into the dirt and left a crater.**\n\nAnd when you do that, you don\u2019t get to whine when someone else picks it up and runs with it.\n\n**They earned their celebration.**  \n**We earned the reruns.**\n\n---\n\n**We underperformed.**  \nThat\u2019s on us.\n\nEverything else?  \nJust background noise.",

        "content": "First of all I haven't watched him play however I have heard that Toni Kroos praised him and asked real madrid to bring him to fill in the role of kroos as a tempo-setter.\n\nHe is a defensive midfielder (24 y.o). He currently has 4 Goal and 9 Assists this season playing in the bundesliga for VFB Stuttgart. I will be watching him in the dfl cup final today. \n\nImo we really need someone like kroos bcz in all the el classicos we lost the battle in the midfield. We need someone who can dicatate the play desperately. So if anyone of you has watched him before could you give any idea how good he actually is?",
