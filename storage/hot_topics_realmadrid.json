He used to be this extremely passionate workhorse but we dont see that nowadays either. He plays like he's tired. Keep in mind this is the captain of real madrid we're talking about here. You wouldnt ever notice that he's the captain if it werent for his armband. This sub is going crazy about Jude and Arda but in reality Fede is the one who's been severly underperforming. Camavinga 100% deserves the starting spot over him. Hope he gets back to his best...",

        "content": "Here's an example of why this couldn't be further from the truth:\n\nManchester City won a treble in 22/23 (in more dominant fashion than our double in 23/24) and yet last season most of their players were terrible. Now Ederson and Gundogan are playing in Turkey, Cancelo and Mahrez are playing in Saudi, De Bruyne and Rodri are injured all the time, Walker plays for the worst team in EPL, Grealish plays for Everton, others like Stones or Ake are washed, even Bernardo or Foden are nowhere as good as they used to be.\n\nApart from Haaland, the only ones who are as good or improved from their 22/23 squad are... Alvarez and Palmer, two players that ironically don't even play for them anymore.\n\nAnd this is just the most recent example, we've seen other teams winning trophies and then regressing a lot soon. Inter 2010, Chelsea 2021 are a couple of good examples. We've seen it with our own team as well. How good were the likes of Marcelo, Isco, Asensio, Varane etc. in 2018 and how these guys were performing a season or two or three later?\n\nI don't understand why people can't grasp the concept of players regressing, even if they won trophies in the near past. Doesn't matter if these players are in their 20s, don't have injury issues or they were very succesful recently. Dembele and Raphinha were both considered failures until a year ago, yet last season they were the two most influential players. Salah went from Ballon d'Or candidate to a completely painful to watch ghost of himself, in a matter of few months. Hazard was considered a top 10 player on earth when he joined us. Players get better and worse all the time, I know some people are too sentimental with our current squad, but it's time we should start accepting that fact, some players (not all of them) are already past their primes.",

We don\u2019t have a proper 8 or 6 who will make us have a good midfield that makes us win matches Our 6, who is  Tchouam\u00e9ni, a 90M worth player, he is not a proper 6. many deserve this place more than him: Caicedo or Elliott Henderson or Wharton or De Jong and many more. And our 8, the English model who doesn\u2019t want to play 8 and makes a mess because he wants to play 10 and park at the front to score tap-ins and celebrate, but to play as a proper 8 and be useful for the team ? No it won\u2019t happen.\n And the big two stars Vini and Kylian who only want their personal benefit, not the team. The poor press they don\u2019t even do it.\nVini , who made the disrespectful action in the classico who loses the ball a million times in every match and become a winger can\u2019t get even agianst any Right back in 1v1 except some matches and we saw it and makes stupid decisions most of the matches this season,man even Bradley put him in his pocket \nAnd Kylian, who wants princess treatment. he won\u2019t press like the rest of the team; he doesn\u2019t want to tire himself every match. He just scores goals and celebrates, that\u2019s all.\n\nXabi obviously have faults but will it be Every time the coach faults? So Carlo was first now Xabi, Every time we will do the same mistake and blame the Coach and forget about the Ridiculous players ?",

But do you ever feel like a few of them have already achieved so much\u2014Champions Leagues, major trophies, individual awards\u2014that the hunger to keep winning isn\u2019t as strong as it used to be?\n\nIt makes me wonder whether it might be healthier for both the club and the players if some of them moved on to their next challenges. That could open space for young, ambitious talents who are absolutely desperate to win trophies and build their legacy.\n\nWe used to have players like Kroos, Ronaldo, Modri\u0107, Benzema, and others who were relentless in their drive to keep winning year after year. I sometimes feel that mentality is what we\u2019re missing now.\n\nWhat do you think? Is this just nostalgia, or is there something to the idea that hunger matters just as much as talent?",

        "content": "Hi, madridistas. \n\nI am going to Madrid at the end of this year, and I would very much like to watch the Real Madrid vs. Real Betis game on January 4, 2025.\n\nI'm Brazilian and I know I'm unlikely to return to Spain again. So this is a unique opportunity. Could you help me with tips on how to buy tickets to watch the game?\n\nI know it's very difficult to buy them online, and I'm already imagining that I won't be able to do it this way. I'm evaluating alternative options: buying directly through socios or buying through reseller websites.\n\nWhat would be the best option?",

        "content": "Why there is a number 10 obsession in this sub. Have people forgotten that there can be two 8s in a team and if you cant play as an 8 then you don't deserve to start for madrid. Last sucessful number 10 at madrid was three peat isco in a stacked madrid team where Benzema, ronaldo, isco, marcelo and carva were playing fluidly to hold the width. This ain't the three peat team. I don't understand why people think your creativity get worse if you are not a 10 on paper.you will always get the ball in right areas no matter what to show your creativity. This ain't fifa. Specially against low blocks,even a fullback can become 10",

        "content": "Real Madrid has looked noticeably worse ever since Franco Mustantouno went down injured. He was never a perfect player, but his nonstop energy, vertical runs, and aggressive work rate on the right side gave the team a crucial extra dimension. With him, opponents had to respect that flank, stretching defenses and creating space for Vini and Mbapp\u00e9 to exploit. Without him, the entire right wing has gone dead, letting teams overload the left and simply lock onto our two superstars. The attack becomes predictable, the buildup stalls, and Madrid loses the balance and unpredictability that Franco\u2019s presence naturally provided.",

        "title": "Our midfield is too unbalanced and lacks technical ability",
        "content": "I've said something similar after the Olympiacos win and every single game the problem becomes more and more evident. We have too many midfielders with the exact same similar weaknesses: creativity from the back, passing and technical ability in general. We have too many \"physical\" midfielders, who aren't that amazing with the ball on their feet.\n\nThe weirdest part is that this team has been so used on playing with the best technical midfielders in the world: Kroos, Modric, Isco and before them, Ozil and Xabi himself. Nowadays apart from Arda, who's also struggling when sharing the pitch with Bellingham and he's getting pushed wider, none of our other (starting) midfielders can distribute the ball well, especially from the back. \n\nAgainst both Olympiacos and Girona we saw the same thing. Tchouameni receives the ball from the defenders, takes 5 touches and... 3 business days to do anything and once he's tighty marked, he does a simple sidepass that leads to more sidepasses, nothing or losing possession. Jude and Fede are nowhere to be found on these situations, so nobody can really collect the ball deep and start an attacking sequence. In the past, Casemiro also wasn't the best ball playing guy ever, but he was surrounded by two of the best passers ever. Now, nobody has these abilities. Camavinga was decent on both halves he played in the recent week defensively, although with the ball on his feet he has the exact same problems.\n\nWe basically need desperately a deep lying playmaker. Can Nico Paz play that role effectively? I'm not sure. Is there anyone else available on the market who is on RM level and won't cost a fortune? Again, not really sure. But until we get someone, even an inconsistent Ceballos might be very useful into balancing out this team. We also have to look into the Fede situation. The guy hasn't had a good performance in a while now.",
