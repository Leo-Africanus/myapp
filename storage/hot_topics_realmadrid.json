But my believe is, to be successful in the long run an to win titles, the attack needs to be complementary - and the three are simply not.\n\nLet\u2019s face it: In their core they are all LW and in particular Vini &amp; Mbapp\u00e9s strenghts (and weaknesses) are too similar. In contrast (and I hate to say that) look at Barcas Raphina, Lewa &amp; LY, how they fit perfectly together and tick all the boxes an attack has to from my point of view.\n\nThe ugly truth in my opinion is: Unfortunately one of them has to go. I have an unpopular opinion who  that should be, but what do you think: Will we win titles with the three? ",

        "title": "There seems to be a prevailing opinion blaming Alaba for yesterday's defeat",
        "content": "I disagree with that. While Alaba wasn't exemplary, I don't think he did that bad &amp; I believe the blame should be directed towards others.\n\nAlaba wasn't bad yesterday except for the foul on Saka that resulted in a goal from the free kick.\nHe kept Saka under control, and the only time Saka went through the defense was when Alaba went over to mark Odegaard and left Saka to bellingham. Saka went through bellingham easily and Alaba tried to sprint back. Luckily, Saka just crossed the ball, and it resulted in nothing.\n\nNow, let's talk about Alaba's tackle on Saka that resulted in the goal:\nThis tackle was made far from Alaba's position. He had to cover for the fact that certain midfielders were not doing much defensive duty (Camavinga in particular). Camavinga made a tackle in this similar position in Saka later in the match, and what do you know? He almost got red carded &amp; resulted in the 2nd goal for Declan.\n\nThe third goal was also the result of shambolic defensive midfield performance. There was far too free space for the opponents, and I don't know what to say about it. But you can see what I'm getting at.\n\n\nNow to the other question:\nWhy was the midfield easily overrun against Arsenal? I believe the answer is:\n\n1. They were outnumbered because our front line failed to fall back and support them, particularly in the 2nd half.\n2. Modric doesn't have the lungs anymore, and Valverde wasn't in the midfield to compensate for that.\n3. Camavinga is tactically illiterate and has zero sense of where to position himself. This is why he's been so bad this season. The man failed to improve since his first season. In fact, I think there's a good case for saying that he has regressed.\n4. Bellingham's workrate seems to have been worsening game after game. Particularly since January.\n\nThis is why Ceballos was so effective when played and manage to help this midfield immensely.\nHe has better tactical sense &amp; decision making, better passing range, and at least a similar workrate to Camavinga. We need Ceballos in that midfield.\n\nI do not understand how a coach like ancelotti, who went through something similar to this in 2014/2015, doesn't see this.",

Have you guys forgotten the player he is? It as if you guys have never seen him play. Some of you saying he has only had one good season is crazy some of you saying he hasn\u2019t improved is crazy. This is his first bad season but if you want him to leave the team you are not a Madrid fan. This guy at his best is capable of being a top 5 midfielder in the world he has been a huge part of our comeback in 2022 and a huge part of the success we had last year. I would argue this guy hasn\u2019t even been able to reach his potential because our manager consistently benches him even after good performances and this was last year and he consistently plays him out of position. I agree Cama deserves critism for this season because he has been disappointing regardless of injuries. but let\u2019s not start acting as if he has shown nothing or done nothing to help this team. True Madrid fans know what this guy is capable of and we are all waiting for him to find that confidence back and find his form",

That's literally the biggest reason all the plastic fans don't like him, because he doesn't have flair like Marcelo or dribble like Marcelo but you know one thing he does better than Marcelo, that's defend which is something he is greatly under appreciated for considering this is a team without Casemiro so he usually on most occasions has to defend in a 1 v 1 against some of the best wingers in the world but he gets beat once than\nIf Mendy has been playing yesterday or even Fran, Saka has a much more quiet night than he did and yes even though I don't think Fran is as good as Mendy defensively, even though he's better offensively, he would have have still done much better than Alaba. This also goes to show how important Tchouameni is because even though Camavinga has lots of energy and is quicker, his positional awareness is nowhere near Tchouameni which would have been crucial in that midfield battle. Modric should never have started.\n\nI just hope players like Mendy and Tchouameni and even Fran can take their game to the next level if we eventually do get a manager that will help them develop their game beyound their own natural ability the way Klopp did for a lot of the youths that came through the Liverpool academy of Flicki for Raphina",

        "content": "Maybe it's time for a change, but a manager who has won 3 out of 5 UCLs and reached the semi-finals in all five with us deserves a respectful farewell.\n\nIt's crazy how some people think Carlo is an idiot and Pep is a genius\u2014meanwhile, Pep loses the UCL year after year, despite having the most balanced and stacked squad, plus a free hand to sign almost any player he wants.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti gave us everything he had. Maybe it's not enough anymore\u2014but hearing fans talk about him like he's the most useless piece of trash is just heartbreaking. Some people are truly ungrateful, entitled, lowlifes, and it's sad to see.\n\nAnd the irony is, for most of them if they saw him in real life, they'd be begging him for a selfie just so they could show it off to their friends and feel better about their lives.\n\nShow some dignity and grace. If you're upset because your friends are trolling you, grow up already. Did you really think you were going to win everything for the rest of your life? You're watching sports\u2014sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. Most people learn that by the age of five.\n\nI think the man is doing his best. And if his best is no longer enough, we part ways respectfully. There's no need to insult him",

Then injuries and fixture congestion starts to take its toll. The team just is unable to play well.\n\nThe season ends without any major silverware. Ancelotti is sacked. The favorite to replace him is a former Spanish midfielder who was once at the club. ",

        "title": "We Need To Talk About Jude In This Team",
        "content": "Jude has been the most important player in this squad both this season and last. Vini insane last season and Valverde now but Jude shades both for me and should have won the Ballon d\u2019or last year due to those national performances with a dysfunctional England team too, if he was properly backed and not Vini. That's not important though. This season, the way he\u2019s been contributing across every area of the game is something we rarely see, not just in Madrid but anywhere in world football. He\u2019s been asked to do practically everything: controlling the midfield, creating chances, scoring goals, defending, pressing, covering for fullbacks\u2014it\u2019s a long list, and he\u2019s consistently delivered in all of them. But while his versatility is a huge asset, the way he\u2019s been used recently hasn\u2019t always brought out his best qualities.\n\nTake the first leg against Arsenal. He was dropped into deeper and wider roles to try to stabilize a shaky midfield, and while he put in a shift and performed, like he always does, it limited his ability to dictate the game or contribute in the final third. Compare that to matches like Valencia or Real Sociedad, where he was positioned more centrally and advanced. In those games, he created chances, controlled the tempo, linked up with the attack, and even got into the box to score. We\u2019ve seen that when he\u2019s given freedom to play higher up the pitch, the team looks far more dangerous and cohesive.\n\nWhat makes Jude stand out, though, isn\u2019t just his versatility. It\u2019s the level he\u2019s performing at in every part of the game\u2014defending, passing, creating, finishing, pressing, and more. He\u2019s the midfielder who plugs gaps everywhere, filling roles his teammates can\u2019t, and yet he\u2019s still delivering at an elite level in his own right. Look at his press-resistance, for instance: in tight games where opponents try to suffocate our midfield, Jude is often the one who finds a way through with his composure and technical skill. Add to that his workrate, his physicality, and his ability to make late runs into the box, and it feels weird sometimes how we can\u2019t win games more easily.\n\nThis is part of why Jude hate baffles me. When he\u2019s asked to play higher up, people complain about a lack of midfield control. When he\u2019s tasked with more defensive running, it\u2019s \u201cwhere are the goals and assists?\u201d But the reality is, Jude is taking on more responsibility than almost anyone else in the team, and often he\u2019s compensating for gaps in the system or poor performances around him. Other midfielders are given clear roles and expectations; Jude is the one making up for deficiencies everywhere. The idea he has PR at this point or is any way overrated baffles me considering takes on him get wilder by the day and media and fans go out of their way to drag him after any bad Madrid performance regardless of how he did or if he does anything that shows literally any emotion or even media skills. Guess it\u2019s just playing for Madrid though\n\nThis is exactly why the system has to be built around him. Not in a way that overburdens him, but in a way that lets him influence the game where it matters most\u2014controlling the midfield, creating chances, and being a goal threat, all while being supported by a cohesive structure that doesn\u2019t demand he do everything at once. When the team gives him the freedom and support he needs, he lifts everyone else around him.\n\nIf we want to secure big wins at all like completing a comeback against Arsenal, winning all the big games we just get owned in like the CDR final, or comfortably winning those smaller ones as we should, it\u2019s going to depend on Jude being at the heart of things. Not as a utility player filling holes wherever needed, but as the focal point of a system that maximizes his strengths and builds around the best midfielder itw. Love Carlo for all he\u2019s done but this season it\u2019s been on him plenty and why I imagine someone else could do a better job along with many other flaws in this team.",
