        "content": "[This is the direct comparison of the clubs mentioned in a discussion about rotation as the ones who care about squad shuffling and giving minutes to backup players + Real Madrid under Carlo Ancelotti](https://i.imgur.com/1GCD1Zr.png). \n\nI'm sure every fan here who said that Carlo never rotates and was using Guardiola, Inzaghi or Flick as a example for proper squad management will not have any problems with pointing non-rotating Real Madrid on this picture, right? I mean the consensus about Ancelotti not using his squad is so common, that it has to be true, right? \n\nWell, let's see. Take a look on this comparison and say to me with a straight face that 4 of the squads are managed by the most rotating managers and 1 is managed by a man allergic to substitutions and giving chances. It does not hold up, like at all. We rotate just as much as them, while having shorter bench. Every top manager rotates and Carlo isn't an exception. Saying that he somehow is recluctant to changing his starting eleven is simply not true when you look at the actual numbers. \n\nI'm baffled how hated Ancelotti is here after what he did for the club. Every critic that called him a manager without tactics and was praising Guardiola should take a good look at how Man City is doing right now. This is the guy you pointed as the most tactical, most dominating manager and his team has a slump much tougher than we ever had with Carlo. Not to mention Carlo did win more trophies than Pep in the last 3 years. He earned respect and this sub is just shitting on him with some made-up arguments like \"he doesn't rotate\". Well, he does. Just as much or even more than some of the coaches pointed as the rotation specialists.",

        "content": "People blame Pintus and luck, but how many more injuries are we going to suffer, because Ancelotti refuses to protect his most important players, even when we're 3-0 up?\n\n* Vini got a muscle injury after playing 90 minutes every game, including the international break (+travelling). Despite the comfortable lead, only 3 subs were made yesterday.\n* Rodrygo suffered a muscle (hamstring) injury in the last 5 minutes of the Dortmund game. Only one sub had been made until that point.\n* Carvajal tore his ACL in the last minute of the Villareal game. We were comfortably winning 2-0, yet Ancelotti had made only 3 subs, one of which was due to another injury (Vini).\n\nAnother example is Militao. He finished the season \"fully\" recovered from his ACL injury and then played pretty much every single minute for Brazil in the Copa America. Then full 90 vs Atalanta. Then 10/11 starts before the Osasuna game, 9 of which were full 90 minutes. And 3/4 starts in the UCL. That's almost zero rest for a player that was out the whole season with a very serious injury, it was inevitable that he was gonna suffer another one sooner or later, sadly it was yet another very serious one.\n\nWhile many might argue that injuries can happen anytime, even in training or during summer friendlies, there's enough evidence that overplayed players tend to be more vulnerable, because they're exhausted. I'm seriously scared for players like Rudiger and Valverde, because I don't see those guys getting rest anytime soon.\n\nI don't understand why Ancelotti rarely uses his 5 subs and barely rotates. Yes, we have issues with the squad (lack of CBs most notably), but it's not like a bench/academy player will score 3 own goals if he plays for 10-15 minutes. See how good Asencio has been for us in the last couple of games? Or rotational players like Arda, Fran and Ceballos? With the extra number of games, other teams and managers seem to want bigger and bigger squads, to deal with the problem. Meanwhile we have a small squad, barely trust our bench and never trust our academy players. And no, you don't need billions to build a huge squad and rotate, like City or Chelsea do. Teams like Dortmund, Juventus, Barcelona etc. rely on their academies. Teams like Inter sign a lot of free players. There are solutions, I wish Ancelotti (and Perez) could see them.",
