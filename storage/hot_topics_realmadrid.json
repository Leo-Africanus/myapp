He would defend, whip long balls and passes and would dictate our attack all simultaneously.\n\nBut now that he's retired, I think we need someone to control our play and Ceballos is the perfect man for that, at least for this season. He has become an essential part of our midfield, especially in our current injury crisis and is proving his worth to Madrid.\n\nAs we know TAA is most likely coming here next season and can take up the passing aspect of Kroos's game, while valverde and Cama take up the defending and Bellingol and Ceballos take up the control of the play.\n\nIf we're able to Find a long term solution for Kroos's replacement, then coupled with the fact that vini and Mbappe's (hoping he'll be back to his best by next year) potent attacking and our reserves team's capabilities (brahim, Bobby, Arda, Ramon and the lads from Castilla), we could end up having a treble on our hands by the next 5 years.",

        "content": "Or could it just be a temporary phase the team is going through?\n\nThe reason I wanted to ask this question is, I look at Arne Slot at Liverpool and he is doing a fantastic job. Not only tactically but he also seems to improve his players 1-1.\n\nIt is reported that he helps his players on an individual basis and is also ruthless in the sense that only performance matters and if you are out of form, you are not going to start and instead get helped on to improve that form. Doesn't matter who you are and players know that. They try to get better.\n\nLike an example is Trent Alexander-Arnold and the man himself said that Arne is strict with him, helped him to improve his defensive game and with that made him one of the best fullbacks of Europe. He also said he personally likes Arne's approach a lot and asked him to be even more strict. And that is shown in stats and how he plays as well.\n\nOr there are other players in the current Liverpool team that got their game leveled up and are able to better stay on form due to Arne and his coaching staff. Even Salah improved a little (which for a player that is already great, wow), he tracks back a lot more and has more assists on top of scoring a lot.\n\nAnd I wonder why can't we do a similar thing? Is it that Arne and his coaching staff are \"special\" and our coaching staff are just \"normal\"? Or are they doing a fundamental and a \"normal\" thing and we are the ones lacking in that department lately?\n\nLike why some other teams can make their otherwise unlooked players perform, level up their games but in our squad, some of our players goes out of form or we can't level up the \"unlooked\" players? Because I'm sure as hell that talent wise we have one of the best squads out there. (I'm not talking about Mbappe or this post isn't about him.)\n\nBtw this is not a dig at a particular coaching staff or Ancelotti himself. Personally I love him and I also can't take a dig even if I wanted to because I'm both not an expert at the matter and also can't see how we train day to day. If I was, this would be a rant post instead of a discussion / a question. :D\n\nI'm also wondering if Ancelotti is showing his age or again is this a temporary phase the team is going through?",
