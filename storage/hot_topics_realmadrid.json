        "content": "Hi all,\n\nFull disclosure: I do not know much about soccer or Real Madrid. But my husband is a huge fan and his first birthday as a married couple is coming up. I was wondering where I could get some good/decent quality but affordable Real Madrid Jerseys? I have looked at Adidas and they seem to be more on the expensive side but I don't know what other sources I can trust; please help. Thank you all!\n\nPS: We live in the US if that makes any difference with options.",
