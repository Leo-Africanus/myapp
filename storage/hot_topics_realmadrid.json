And I don't think Konate would fit Alonso's style to be honest. Anyways I digress.  \n\n\n\n3. The \"Ramos Copycat\" Ranking\nThis ranking weighs Aerial Dominance (30%), Ball Playing (30%), Goal Threat (20%), and Aggression/Presence (20%).\n\n\n\n\n1\tLuka Vuskovic\t88%\tThe closest thing to a young Ramos. Huge goal threat, 97th percentile aerials, and plays with a \"chaos\" factor. He just needs to refine his passing.\n\n\n2\tJacobo Ram\u00f3n\t82%\tThe \"System\" Successor. Already on Madrid's books. He has the elite passing and strong aerials (74%) to fit the role perfectly, though less of a goal threat than Vuskovic.\n\n\n3\tTiago Gabriel\t75%\tThe Wildcard. 1 goal in 10 games and strong aerials. A very raw, aggressive profile that mimics Ramos's early Sevilla days.\n\n\n4\tIbrahima Konat\u00e9\t65%\tMatches the aerial dominance, but is too \"safe\" on the ball and doesn't score enough to be a true Ramos clone.\n\n\n5\tWilliam Saliba\t40%\tThe Varane Clone. He is elite, but he is \"polite\" (0 yellow cards). Ramos was a warrior; Saliba is a surgeon.\n\n\n6\tMicky van de Ven\t25%\tA Ferrari of a defender, but poor in the air and average distribution. He is a completely different breed of CB.",

Or does La Liga usually keep the schedule as it is? I\u2019m also wondering if the Champions League match vs Ajax on the 20th affects anything.\n\nBasically: should I book my return flight for the 19th to safely catch the match, or is there a real chance that Supercopa/CL scheduling will push the Levante game to another date?\n\nAny advice from people familiar with La Liga scheduling would be really appreciated.",

Absolutely awful performance by Castilla\n\nFT - a performance to forget and a very deserved loss for Castilla, who couldn't find their usual flow and then got taken out for good by a quick double blow in the second half. A disappointing and surprisingly bad performance after the good match against Cacere\u00f1o, and they quickly need to brush it off before the next matchday\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 21:15 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Municipal Reina Sof\u00eda, Salamanca \n\n**Referee**: Aimar Velasco Arbaiza\n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 1, Matchday 13\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[LaLiga+](https://www.laligaplus.laliga.com/) (subscription - 14.99\u20ac/month) (only available in Spain)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-3-3): Fran Gonz\u00e1lez - Manu Serrano (46' Diego Aguado), V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as, Joan Mart\u00ednez, David Jim\u00e9nez (79' Cristian David) - Jorge Cestero, Thiago Pitarch, Dani Mesonero (46' Pol Fortuny) - \u00c1lvaro Leiva, C\u00e9sar Palacios, Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez\n\nBench: Javi Navarro (GK), Guille S\u00fanico (GK), Mario Rivas, Lamini Fati, \u00c1lvaro Gin\u00e9s, Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga. \n\nUnavailable: Jes\u00fas Fortea (injury), Manuel \u00c1ngel (red card suspension), Roberto Mart\u00edn (injury), Bruno Iglesias (injury), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Rachad Fettal (injury). \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** WDWLW\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 5th | 21pt | 7-0-5 | 15:13\n",

        "content": "As everybody here in the sub knows already: Since Bellingham returned to the team, something's been off with our chemistry \u2013 especially in attack. I suspect Bellingham \"believes\" he has established himself as a  10 at REal after his fantastic 23/24 season. However in my humble opinion this is absurd and wrong. He was actually a false 9, not a playmaker. And now that he has Mbapp\u00e9 ahead of him, there's no need for a false 9.   \nWe need a true number 10 now. And obviously, that's currently Arda for us. Jude is a world-class 6/8, and I think he should accept this role for the good of the team. If all goes well, Bellingham will still be playing for Madrid for the next 10 years, while Xabi will most likely stay a maximum of 2 maybe 3 seasons. Everything will be different with the next manager anyway, but as things stand, he and his father should keep their heads down and accept Jude's role as a 6/8 for the sake of the club and Xabi's system.
