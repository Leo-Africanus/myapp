        "content": "The quality of football has significantly dropped in LaLiga in past 1-2 years. The intensity weakened, the players are moving like they are 50+ years old. It is easiest to see when LaLiga clubs face non LaLiga teams. For example, Barcelona players against Chelsea were in \u201cslow-mode\u201d. Similar problem is with us. How did we develop that? I don\u2019t see that enemy teams are pressing a lot, to make us run non-stop, but we rather play super slow and wait for Mbappe to score. \n\nI was hyped to see Atletic Bilbao and Villareal to play in Champions League, but now I am disappointed. \n\nRemember few years ago, Spanish football was dominant, and playing in such league made Real Madrid strong. What we see today is slow and boring football. ",

        "content": "First of all, I think Xabi is doing an acceptable job overall given his constraints and the nature of the squad that he has. However, improvements can be made. \nTo me, the team needs to play at a faster pace. We spend a considerable amount of time in the buildup phase of an attack and that gives the opposition too much time to set themselves defensively. That makes defences harder to unlock generally and near impossible against disciplined teams. \nAdditionally, by spending so much time trying to break a defence makes the players vulnerable on the transition since the defence tends to lose concentration defensively after attacking for so long. \nIn football, possession is a statistic that means nothing. When you have the ball, do something with it quickly. The scoreline is the only metric worth tracking. ",

However, the key difference is that Gareth Bale arrived at Real Madrid as one of the top three players in the Premier League at the time \u2014 a true superstar that any team in the world would have loved to sign.\n\nFor more than seven years with Madrid, Gareth Bale was one of the most criticized players. And the funny thing is that the excuses fans now make for Rodrygo were never once brought up for Gareth Bale: \u201cOh, he\u2019s not playing in his preferred position\u2026 Oh, he\u2019s overshadowed because of Ronaldo and Benzema\u2026 Oh, he doesn\u2019t get special treatment like the other stars of the team.\u201d\n\nRodrygo will live long on the memory of what he did against Man City and Chelsea.

Even during the Barca treble years there was absolutely reports of unrest. RM have always been one of the most media secure football clubs as far as I've known. But what's changed now?\n\nWe're literally top of the table. Have 2 defeats in the season till now with 2 draws. How is there so much unrest? How is Alonso's job at risk? We've got the best defence in the league &amp; 3rd best in UCL. Coming to Alonso. Is he making mistakes? Yes. Are some of his decisons highly questionable? 100%. But that's what you get with a manager with 2+1/2 seasons of senior management. HE WILL MAKE MISTAKES! THAT IS WHAT YOU GET WITH A YOUNG MANAGER.\n\nArteta took time. Kompany literally got relegated. You have to give him the headroom to learn from his mistakes instead of sack threats. Are we not allowed a transition? Are we not alloed a rebuild phase? Plus its a well known fact that we had an incomplete transfer window!\n\nComing to the dressing room. I feel so sad. Bunch of primadonnas. How have you had your head so up your arse as to not renew your contract cause the manager is rotating you? Its his job ffs! His job is create tactics &amp; win &amp; your job is to play the way he wants! These massive egos will ruin the club. I really believed these issues would never appear at RM.\n\nFreaking Cristiano was let go due to these issues. Who do these players think they are?           \n\nI miss Sergio Ramos in times like this. \n\nPS - I'm not defending Alonso but he's exactly what you're gonna get with a young manager.

        "content": "Real Madrid will never be a club defined by average players or a modest star system like Bayer Leverkusen because its identity is built on global media power and the constant pursuit of the biggest names in football. The club thrives on being a spectacle, a brand that demands the brightest stars to maintain its dominance in sales, sponsorships, and media rights. Xabi Alonso understood this culture when he joined, adapting to the reality that Madrid is not just a team, but a global institution. To suggest that Real Madrid would willingly sell off all its star players is absurd, because the club\u2019s financial model and prestige depend on showcasing elite talent. The Gal\u00e1ctico tradition ensures that Madrid will always attract and retain world-class players, reinforcing its status as the ultimate footballing stage.",

        "content": "The situation is worrying. Very reliable sources indicate that several players aren\u2019t buying into the coach\u2019s ideas and are already pushing for his exit after just a few months. To me, that reflects immaturity more than anything else \u2014 a group that has gotten used to having things their way. It\u2019s not shocking coming from Vini, but it is disappointing to see someone like Valverde, a captain, fall into the same pattern, projecting his poor form onto the coach instead of taking responsibility.\n\nI\u2019m not saying Xabi is necessarily the perfect fit, but he\u2019s clearly addressing the main structural issues we carried over from last season. The club cannot bend to players\u2019 whims; even Ronaldo \u2014 arguably the greatest in our history \u2014 was shown the door when he tried to strong-arm the club.\n\nThis is precisely the moment to reaffirm that principle. And I trust P\u00e9rez to make the right decisions.",

        "content": "We just came of our worst season in a long time in the last season.Not everything will be immediately fixed.No coach will ever be able to fix a club with many problems immediately.It will need some time. \n\nWe can't overspend like the premier league clubs because of La Liga rules which is a handicap for us. \n\nWe are basically in a transition period with many of our legends like Kroos and Modric either retiring or leaving the club. \n\nWe have many young talented players who just need some time to settle down. \n\nWe still haven't figured out our proper play style yet and our players haven't yet gotten used to Xabi's tactics. \n\nSo guys I ask we all stay calm and quiet atleast for this season and let Xabi do his work. \n\nIt's not going to be the end of the world if we don't win the champions league this season. \n\nRemember Jose Mourinho built the blueprint of the team which ended up winning 4 champions league in 5 years and Mourinho's team took a while to get going. \n\nSo please stay calm and let the professionals handle it.",

Although many do not want to see it, this team lacks creativity. There are too many one-on-one players and physically gifted midfielders, but few players capable of combining and creating play, apart from Arda and, if he manages to settle in, Mastantuono.",

        "content": "I know some of us don't want to admit it but some of our players are overrated. We have always had world class players in every position in this team, but if you look at the squad post 2024 our quality is severely diminished in all areas except the keepers. Not to say we have bad players, they are good but some of them are at best average at what they do without kroos, modric and benzema holding their hands. Look at some of the quality we lost since those three left: No Aerial threats, our set pieces have gone down the gutter, inconsistent forwards, midfield now lacks a technical player that isn't afraid of the ball, our defense is trash, our right side is completely dead without Carvajal, the bench is full of average players mixed in with young players who wont get chances to play (We have two strikers rotting on the bench) and most importantly we lost our mentality. The only reliable position we have is goalkeeping and thats because its courtois and we have a very good backup in lunin. The squad planning since the departure of Benzema has been questionable to say the least and those two ucl wins glossed over the issues which we are now facing. \n\nI know I'm going to get downvoted just because of what I said but at this point I don't really care. We have become an average team and unless these players start to play for the club and not themselves, we will remain average and no coach is going to fix this doesn't matter if its carlo, xabi or zidane.",
