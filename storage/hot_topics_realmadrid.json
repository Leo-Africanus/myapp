        "content": "Boy oh boy, where do I even begin. Fede\u2026 my lion-hearted angel, my Uruguayan prince. I have adored you from the moment I first saw you tear down the pitch with that unstoppable energy. The way you command the midfield with fire in your heart and thunder in your boots\u2014it takes my breath away every time. Your fierce tackles, your rocket of a shot, that tireless engine that never quits\u2026 you are poetry in motion.\n\nI would do anything for you, mi halc\u00f3n. Sometimes I wish I could freeze time so I'd never have to witness the day you hang up your boots. You\u2019ve been through so much, but you never let it break you. You rose from humble beginnings to become the heartbeat of Real Madrid. Off the pitch, you\u2019re a beautiful soul\u2014a devoted partner, a loving father\u2014and sometimes, I even catch myself calling you \u201cdad.\u201d\n\nThe thought of one day watching you leave the Bernab\u00e9u fills me with dread. I would trade my own happiness if it meant I could see you smile just one more time after a thunderbolt goal or a clutch tackle in the dying minutes of a Cl\u00e1sico. You've brought me joy, you've brought me tears, but above all, you\u2019ve given me pride.\n\nI remember when you chased down Morata in the Supercopa, and sacrificed yourself for the badge. It was in that moment I knew\u2014you weren\u2019t just a player. You were ours. And then, your goal against City\u2026 my heart stopped. Time froze. You were him.\n\nNow you\u2019re growing into a legend, but still that same humble warrior we first fell in love with. You've changed football, you've changed me. I love you, my pookie bear, my glorious hawk, Federico Valverde.\n",

        "content": "So this is Bilbao, the best defense in La Liga that conceded the less goals. It's clear that they came here for a point. They didn't counter but just parked the bus with all of their players, which is more horrible than even Atletico Madrid's haram football. And it's not their C team or D team, I took a look in their formations in La Liga and they do rotate a lot in defense, but still barely concede.\n\nSo our team was shit during the entire season, I know that and fully agree. 2nd half was actually very good and we completely dominated and had all kinds of opportunities, from the right flank ( Valverde's shot ), left flank ( Vini constantly ), from a cross ( Jude's header ), from a fast counter ( Cama ) and lots, but we were unlucky and bad with the finishing. And the fucking ref did a tremendous job in breaking our rhythm with that offside review that should be called from the VAR room.\n\nIf we were a bit more clinical in finishing today, we could have won 3-0, we played a very good second half. Subs were correct, Ceballos still not fit and Endrick was pulling defenders with him, Brahim caused the goal and Arda did good, even LV almost assisted Bellingham but sadly he missed. Endrick was unlucky with his foot slightly been offside to cost Vinicius a goal.\n\nYet people here are like 'as usual, individual brilliance, we have no tactics'. And I'm seeing random screenshots of 'where is our midfield' that are supposed to be proof that we were ass.. well we were NOT, NOT in this game. YES we have been ass for the full season but NOT for the 2nd half of this game !\n\nJust stop it. Y'all getting what you want. Ancelotti is leaving in the end of the season. Celebrate all you want, be happy. But if your team plays well, which what this sub has been asking for months, shut up or celebrate and don't downgrade it.",

        "content": "There's a well-known theory, developed by Pepe Kollins, that explains how Real Madrid evolves over time.\n\nThe article is in Spanish. It's not the original source, but it's very well explained.\n\nhttps://www.lagalerna.com/ciclo-karmico-madridista/\n\nIt goes like this:\n\nStage 1 - Dictator Stage: A new trainer comes to put order, work and rigor in a relaxed team. Supporters celebrate his arrival. Mou or Capello are good examples.\n\nStage 2 - Happy stage: A new trainer comes. He usually has a deep knowledge of the club. Work and order have good results. Team wins. Del Bosque and Carlo. Zidane also.\n\nStage 3 - \"Asador\" stage: Everyone relax too much. Players stop listening to the trainer. The president is too conservative and don't make decisions. Suddenly things don't work any more. Bad results. Crisis. Apocalypse. \n\nThis cycle has been happening over the last 30 years with no exception.\n\nIt is clear that we're at \"Asador\" stage now. A new \"dictator\" is about to come.\n\nXabi Will be welcomed. ",

        "title": "Our UCL exit might have been a blessing in disguise",
        "content": "We might get new signings to fill the demanding positions and Carlo will have to create new tactics for the evolving football. The players will also develop hunger, especially Kylian Mbappe who might have thought will win the ucl(or even the treble) in his first season. \n\nEras come to an end, and I think this season we've run out of \"luck\". Football tactics might stop working at some point, and that may be the reason Carlo's tactics haven't been great this season. I'm not sure if that's the same issue with pep at man city. Every manager needs to adjust their tactics as football keeps evolving everyday. \n\nSome reasons for this season's failure is how the team has not built the perfect midfield fluidity, how the team hasn't been defending as a whole; the forwards rarely track back to defend. \n\nRemember last season how our attack was so lethal? Because both Vini and Rodrygo knew they were the best forwards we had, and they had to give it their all as there was no great #9. This season the attack hasn't been as lethal as everyone expected, and I think the main reason is that they lack chemistry and they don't give their all,every forward thinks Mbappe should do all the work. \n\nMy suggestion to improve the team would be, the attacking trio need to play top tier football, otherwise sooner or later one might have to go to make way for a top #9. The club has to sign new fullbacks and atleast one CB. Carlo needs to tweak his tactics to ensure they work accordingly as injuries have cost us so much this season. The forwards have to help in defending. They should also stop relying on individual brilliance, every attacker needs to produce goals like their life depended on it. \n\nDisclaimer: I'm a keyboard warrior, and I don't know shit about managing players or playing 90 minutes on the pitch. These are just suggestions to help improve the team. \n\nLet's hope Carlo adapts quickly and the players give it their all.\n\n HALA MADRID! \n",
