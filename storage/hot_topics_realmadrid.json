But he still had a lot of potential and to some extent has proven that he is a top talent.\n\nHonorable Mentions: Gareth Bale and Isco. I didn\u2019t include them because they contributed and have their own legacies but they had potential for even more.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Any players that come to mind?",

Also considering the scenario in which rodrygo stays that means endrick could possibly get less minutes than last season since we might be playing with 2 attackers. It's really sad to see honestly because endrick is better than gonzalo (except for aerial ability) and has the potential to be insane, he literally saved us in the copa del rey and had 5 goals in 5 games",

        "content": "Can someone please explain to me why we let Zubimendi get past us? I understand the 60 Million was pretty high but considering today's market, I am struggling to understand the reasoning behind this. \n\nLast season we really struggled to play the ball from the back ESPECIALLY from the center circle of the pitch. This season without Modric (who arguably created the most \"futbol\" through the middle for us), a Ceballos who does not seem to convince Xabi, and Tchouameni/Camavinga who are most likely to have a stronger presence in defence and perhaps in quick counters, I am struggling to see how we have a squad strong enough for this upcoming season.\n\nEven with Zubimendi gone, this honestly feels like another negligent window. We needed a Zubimendi and a creative midfielder BADLY. We have NONE OF THOSE.\n\nI am not one for ringing the alarm bells without reason but I hope this team and president back this manager because he deserves it.",
