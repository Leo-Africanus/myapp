        "title": "[TheAthletic] Real Madrid\u2019s mentality worries put extra pressure on Xabi Alonso",
        "content": "After Real Madrid\u2019s 5-2 defeat by Atletico Madrid back in September, stern words were shared among the first-team group.\n\nSources who witnessed this, speaking anonymously to protect their position like others consulted for this article, say there was a frank exchange between players, with particular criticism aimed at junior members of the squad over their attitude and application in the build-up.\n\nIt was the first major test of this new squad, and they badly failed it.\n\nSince then, Madrid have managed to get things back on track. They are two points clear of Barcelona in La Liga. They have registered two wins from two in the Champions League so far. But, in truth, they haven\u2019t been significantly tested.\n\nFor that reason there is concern that, as Xabi Alonso\u2019s side enters a difficult run that includes games against Juventus, Barcelona and Liverpool over the next two weeks, issues over leadership and the team\u2019s mentality may surface again, with another mis-step likely to add significant pressure on the manager.\n\nOne club source likened the situation around Alonso right now to a player in danger of receiving a yellow card, with the match only just having started.\n\nTo understand why Madrid have these concerns, we need to look back a little.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2024, Madrid celebrated six Champions League titles, an unprecedented number that leaves their total number of European Cup wins at 15. The closest team to them, Milan, have won it seven times.\n\nMadrid\u2019s squad did not stay the same over that decade, far from it. Key players came and went, managers were hired and fired. But there was still a strong sense of continuity: Toni Kroos and Lucas Vazquez won five of those six titles. Luka Modric, Dani Carvajal and Nacho were there for each one.\n\nCarvajal, 33, is the only of that group still at Madrid today. He is the club\u2019s current longest-serving player, and therefore its captain (as is policy at the Santiago Bernabeu). Thibaut Courtois is the same age but he has not been at Madrid as long \u2014 Federico Valverde, 27, is vice-captain.\n\nAfter that Champions League title in 2024, three influential senior players left. Kroos retired. Nacho joined Al Qadsiah in Saudi Arabia. Joselu \u2014 who was only at Madrid a year but was still a big voice in the dressing room \u2014 left for Al Gharafa in Qatar.\n\nLast summer, two more departed: Modric is now at Milan and Vazquez is with Bayer Leverkusen in Germany.\n\nThe presence of senior players was always an important factor for Carlo Ancelotti during his second spell at the club from 2021 to 2025, a period in which they won the Champions League twice, as well as two La Liga titles and the Spanish Cup.\n\nAt Madrid, there is an unwritten rule that players over the age of 30 are only offered one-season contract extensions, with these proposals often only coming close to the end of the campaign.\n\nWhenever the club asked Ancelotti for his opinion on these renewals, the Italian was always in favour of keeping the veterans. It was a footballing issue first and foremost, but also an environmental one.\n\nTowards the end of the 2023-2024 season, a source involved in the day-to-day running of Real Madrid considered it \u201cessential\u201d that at least one of Modric (who ended up renewing) and Kroos (who decided to retire) stayed. This year, the situation was described in the same way when there were doubts about the continuity of Modric again and it looked like Vazquez might depart.\n\n\u201cIf they both leave this is going to be very difficult,\u201d the source said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a technical issue, but rather one of atmosphere. If Carvajal is left alone, he\u2019ll explode within a month.\u201d\n\nNeither Modric nor Vazquez were renewed, despite concerns developing over the dressing room atmosphere last term, and that apparent worry over Carvajal.\n\nOver 2024-25, Madrid went from having (according to staff sources at the time) \u201cthe best dressing room\u201d in the previous season to one with more ego and friction. The fact the campaign ended without a trophy did not help.\n\nIt got to the point that one first-team player told The Athletic in May: \u201cLet\u2019s see if Xabi dares to enter this madhouse.\u201d\n\nHe did indeed. Alonso\u2019s arrival was seen by Madrid not only as a way to improve the team\u2019s play and results, but also to improve the day-to-day functioning of the dressing room.\n\nSources familiar with the situation say that Alonso found \u201ca dressing room with many bad habits\u201d. The Basque coach has been working on creating a new culture, asking for key elements such as punctuality, and high intensity in training sessions.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve gone from having a coach who was hardly involved in training sessions (Ancelotti) to one who seems like just another player,\u201d a person close to a first-team player said.\n\nMadrid\u2019s squad still has its senior figures, but there is definitely a sense that they do not possess as many leaders as they once did.\n\nThis summer, along with new manager Alonso came five reinforcements. Academy striker Gonzalo Garcia was promoted to the first team, Dean Huijsen joined from Bournemouth, Trent Alexander-Arnold from Liverpool, Franco Mastantuono from River Plate and Alvaro Carreras from Benfica. The average age of these signings was under 22.\n\nHuijsen, although he started positively, has made several much-commented mistakes in recent weeks. Sources say he has been specifically asked to improve his concentration in order to develop his great potential.\n\nMeanwhile, even though Alexander-Arnold was, at 27, the most experienced of those summer arrivals, he is described around the club as someone who will need more time to adapt, as he still seems shy.\n\nThis term, Kylian Mbappe is one of the players who has stepped up, although he is described more as a leader in matches than on a day-to-day basis, where he does not reach the level of Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s well-documented ego and hunger.\n\nDespite the noise that has surrounded Valverde in recent weeks, the Uruguayan is noted as a leader through the daily example of his work ethic, while Aurelien Tchouameni, signed in 2022, is also seen as heading in the right direction.\n\nHowever, there are others who need to fill the void left by the departed veterans, such as Jude Bellingham.\n\nAlonso and his staff feel that now is the best time to pull together, to reap the rewards of all their hard work and changes. They point out that they have only made one mistake, against Atletico, but that it caused such a stir that it brought back memories of the heavy defeat by Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup semi-final in July (which Madrid lost 4-0).\n\nAnother mis-step in the big games ahead would call into question the credibility of the project, complicate the run-up to Christmas, and leave Madrid with real pressure to win the Spanish Super Cup in January, where they face Atletico in the semi-finals with Athletic Club and Barcelona to contest the other.\n\nFirst up it\u2019s Juve in the Champions League, followed by the small matter of El Clasico on Sunday.",
