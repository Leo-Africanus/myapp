We saw how Arteta demanded respect and inlisted discipline into his players. Flick has shown that he can be a friend to his players and take no nonesense. \n\nI really hope Xabi is a manager that takes no bullshit. I dont care who you are, if you are lacking disciple, u need to get benched. \n\n\nI honestly love how Mbappe is coolheaded.

        "content": "So lets look at the stats, lets start with last season, because thats when i started having problems with Rodrygo.\n\nSo if we focus specifically on the league, lets start with last season\n\n23/24:\n\nBetween gameday 1, and gameday 12, or essentially three months, Rodrygo scored 1 goal, and got 1 assist.\n\nThen after that, between gameday 13 and gameday 17, almost two months, he scored 6 goals and got 3 assists.\n\nThen after that, for the reason of the season, in 20 games, he got 3 goals, and 1 assist.\n\nAnd now in this current 24/25 season:\n\nBetween matchday 1 and matchday 16, almost 4 months, Rodrygo got 3 goals and 1 assist. (He did miss 3 games due to injury)\n\nThen once again in around december, he went crazy, between matchday 17 and 21, he scored 3 goals and assisted 5.\n\nThat was in January, and now we're almost in may, and Rodrygo hasn't scored or assisted a single goal in the league since. Obviously there has been goals or assists in the CL, but if we're just looking at the league, this isn't good at all.\n\nIm really tired of this narrative of how he's played out of position and all that, if he can't adapt to the right wing, then he's gonna have to be benched, or sold, because he just isn't better than Vini on the left, even though this sub probably has a hateboner for Vini right now because he didn't play very well in the final, i think if we're being objective, Vini is a better left winger than Rodrygo is. Having Rodrygo and Lucas Vazquez on the same flank feels fucking horrible, and its not really surprise to me that the moment both of these players were subbed off for Kylian and Arda/Modric, that we started playing infinitely better yesterday, we were actually able to carry the ball forward from defence.\n\nI love Rodrygo, he's one of those unhateable players, everyone loves Rodrygo, but he is painfully inconsistent, i still remember all those edits from before this season about how the force of Kylian/Jude/Vini/Rodrygo would be unstoppable, and i always thought ''Why the fuck is Rodrygo included in that conversation with 3 greats?'' I really fail to see why we have to change our entire formation into a 4-3-3 just so that Rodrygo can fit in on the right wing, when he hasn't really done anything to deserve us changing from our best formation, which would be with Vini and Kylian up top with Jude behind them, then Tchou+Fede with Luka/Cama/Dani/Arda as the 3 behind Jude.",

        "content": "I totally get our frustrations this season and I agree with many of the points already discussed by everyone. Madrid will succeed again. We always do. \n\nThat being said, in analyzing the season, I think we should be careful not to blame Mbappe for our failures. I'm not saying everyone is doing that but there seems to be a sense of buyer's remorse because he hasn't hit the heights we expected yet. \n\nThings will click. This young team needs clearer coaching, strategy and instruction as they enter their primes. We need those signings we all know of. Some players need to leave. Many players still need to mature their game. But Mbappe, for a \"sub-par\" season, just passed CR7's first season goal record and brought us back into the game yesterday.\n\nBefore he got here, most of us wanted that level of player up front. Once the team balance is figured out, it can be even better. Tchouameni said it well: We'll be back. In the meantime, let's not make the mistake of regretting the good things we already have. Like a free transfer World-Class Kylian Mbappe \ud83d\ude0c \u00a1Hala Madrid!",

Unsportsmanlike behavior an understatement and completely unacceptable.\n\nThe way vini complains after each and every touch like he is entitled to get calls for him.\nJust play your heart out like Fede and Jude.\n\nThere is no comradery in the team like it used to be. We finally played well for once this season against a big team but IMHO we can't start winning unless this attitude from some players change.",
