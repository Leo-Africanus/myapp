        "title": "Real Madrid &amp; Xabi Alonso - How do we lineup for next season?",
        "content": "With the current squad and done deals how do we see us starting with Xabi?\n\nThis will be a long one, and very opinionated.\n\nTaking into consideration the 3-5-2 that Xabi is known for, some tweaks will have to be made for it to be suitable for Real Madrid.\n\nThe idea is to use the talent we have instead of digging for a midfielder. I strongly believe the current squad can be used to make the team stronger and more creative but it will require some changes to players positions. Mainly Tchouameni and Guler.\n\n1. TCHOUAMENI as the 3rd defender: Tchouameni proved to be a versatile player and he picked up his form significantly at the end of the season. Playing him in middle of the 2 CBs during buildup gives us a solid defender with great ball playing abilities to cycle possession and keep the press up while we have possession. Pressing high and abortion any counters before they even start. Asencio and Huisjen are fast players that can help cover for long balls.\n\n2. GULER as the creative output: Its time to get Guler out of the winger position and give him more playmaking roles. Guler can easily be our creative output in the midfield diamond with flexible roaming and movement, his development into a Modric regen should accelerate in a more central position. \n\n3. JUDE back up front: With Kylian's deal last year its clear that we will not be having a pure number 9. Its time to play Jude back behind The frontline to strengthen our goal scoring options. He already proved he is a great space player and is always in the right place which should work very will with Mbappe's drop-deep style of play.\n\n4. VALVERDE is still the heartbeat: Valverde will be the one staying deep with a higher workrate than Guler. I might even Switch Valverde to the right side and Guler to the left as Fran Garcia requires less defensive cover up than Arnold. Valverde will be chasing second balls and acting as linkup between sides during buildup working dynamicly with Guler and Tchouameni to cycle posession. With a more posession based play I also expect Valverde to develop his passing game and become a solid possession distribution option for us, a true successor to his idol number 8.\n\n5. VINICIUS and MBAPPE double trouble: Vinicius and Mbappe are our target forwards. They will spearhead attacks, take shots, and most importantly draw defenders. Vinicius can easily draw 3-4 defenders when on the ball freeing space for Bellingham, Mbappe, or a marauding Arnold on the other side. Mbappe can also drop deeper to receive and link with Jude and Vinicius to break into the box.\n\nOut of possession Real Madrid can go back to 4-3-3 with Tchouameni going back to hid CDM role and guler going wider.\n\nThe move forward with Xabi is a transitional one and with such a young squad I think a lot of the players will change and grow into different roles and positions to accommodate for the possession and high press playstyles that will probably be the new identity. I wouls LOVE to see Valverde and Guler develop into modric and kroos types.\n\nVery interested to hear what everyone thinks",

        "content": "Tchouameni, Camavinga, Bellingham, Valverde, Arda, Ceballos, Mastantouno, Brahim.\n\n8 midfielders for 3 positions in midfield. Lets say Mastantouno shares right wing with Rodrygo. thats still 7 top midfielders that deserve a lot of playing time. I know we had tonnes of injuries and many games but I feel like someones gotta go.\n\nIll even say Rodrygo should share left wing with Vini and Arda and Franco share right wing, just to give more space to more players. Thats still 6 players competing for limited spots.\n\nHow do you guys see this playing out? Is everyone going to be happy? Are the younger players like Arda, Franco and Cama going to stay as rotation players and stall their progress? The 2 players i see most unhappy here are Brahim and Ceballos and personally I wouldnt want either of them to leave. But if they arent consistent and stamping their identity on the team like the others, I feel they are the most likely to be unhappy by midseason with lack of minutes.\n\nEDIT FORGOT TO ADD: Bellingham will probably miss first 3 months if he does the shoulder surgery so that may give more minutes to someone ",

        "content": "Our La Liga points tally was lower in 18/19, we got knocked out in CL at the Bernabeu in R16, lost to CDR in the semis to Barca.\n\nBut still last season was more disappointing for me. All because of the expectation to performance ratio. Losing CR7 with no replacement meant that 18/19 season was doomed to fail. \n\nIn terms of a single moment though, that horror week of 18/19 tops everything. In one week we lost 3 matches at the Bernabeu, 0-3 to Barca in CDR, again lost to Barca 0-1 in the league and then lost to Ajax 1-4. Knocked out of all 3 in one week. Nothing tops that.\n",
