        "title": "Real Madrid will file a complaint to FIFA over refereeing",
        "content": "Source: Marca\nTranslation: Google\n\nReal Madrid Television announced it at 6:50 p.m. News. Real Madrid is preparing a dossier on what happened from the refereeing perspective in these first four matchdays of La Liga and last season to send to FIFA so they can take note of what's happening in Spain. The Whites were outraged by the refereeing incident at Anoeta and decided to make public a measure they have been working on for some time. \"It's a shame we have to talk about this scandal and not about Mbapp\u00e9's great game or Tchouam\u00e9ni's 150 matches,\" they stated on RMTV, where they insisted. \"Real Madrid will present this report so that FIFA can take note.\"\n\nThe Real Madrid club ended the match against Real Sociedad outraged by Huijsen's red card, which wasn't reviewed by VAR despite Oyarzabal being on the touchline, 50 meters from goal, and Militao being level with the Malaga native. \"The fact that the referee wasn't given the chance to review it...\" the players lamented. Even Xabi Alonso, usually calm with the referees, couldn't believe it, received a yellow card for protesting, and ended up demanding an explanation from the referee. \n\nOn Real Madrid television, they're reporting on a red card report dating back to the Negreira era , stating that Bar\u00e7a's record against the Reds is +65 , while Real Madrid is at -2 . In the Champions League, the club claims, the record is +12 for Bar\u00e7a and +13 for Real Madrid. They don't understand why, in the 21st century, Bar\u00e7a has a winning record in 65 games playing with a man advantage, while Real Madrid has a winning record in two games playing with one less man.  \n\nMbapp\u00e9's disallowed goal against G\u00fcler for offside didn't raise as many eyebrows, although Real Madrid believes the VAR frame rate is detrimental to them in 90% of cases. Once again, the Frenchman's offside position was pinpoint accurate. \n\nMadrid does not change its policy\nThe Whites made it clear before the season began that they weren't happy with the changes to the CTA and that they wouldn't stop until all the referees or directors who had had contact with Negreira were removed. The war continues, and the start of the season isn't helping.\n\nBecause Madrid is no longer just denouncing the refereeing decisions it suffered, but that report will also reveal facts such as the fact that the Rayo-Bar\u00e7a match was played without VAR during certain phases of the match, coinciding, for example, with a non-existent penalty on Lamine Yamal. \n\nMadrid will take all of this to FIFA, a complaint that serves as a measure of pressure in response to what it considers \"a constant abuse\" that began with Negreira.  \n\n\n\n\n",

Do they review how the first half went and adjust their approach for the second? For instance, if certain players are playing dirty or pushing limits, do refs talk about it during the break and agree to be stricter or keep a closer eye on them once the game restarts?",

A little goal I have is to get that little collection back (new ones of course, the old original ones got taken most probably). ",

        "content": "The last game I attended was 20 years ago when I was a study abroad student. I\u2019m in town for the Oct 4th game and desperately want to attend. I apologize if these are silly questions but it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve been to a game. Questions I still have after googling and searching this sub:\n\n1. Where are the best seats? After searching this sub, it looks like the north side next to the box is good? 100-300 seats? I typically like to be at least 200 level for a wider view. I ask this because I find posts that mention seats on the other side of the stadium are good as well.\n\n2. After researching, it looks like most people without Spanish credit cards have a difficult time buying tickets online even if they\u2019re paying madrista fees with a valid global cc. I\u2019m an Irish citizen living in America. I use Amex everywhere. Will I run into issues when tickets open up despite being a \u201cmadrista\u201d? Is it safe to buy from stubhub beforehand? (I researched this as well and found varying answers). At home, it\u2019s a safe way to buy American football tickets but I wouldn\u2019t assume that\u2019s the case everywhere.\n\n3. I will be attending alone, so what are the chances there\u2019s a single seat in a great area available on sept 30, when I get into town? \n\n4. I appreciate any and all advice! \n\nEdit: I couldn\u2019t find a great flair for this post, forgive me!",
