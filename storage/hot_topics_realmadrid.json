Still able to play but with painkillers, most likely not able to bring out his best performance and worsen the injury.\n\nCourtois our main goalkeeper will only be ready against arsenal.\n\nFran Gonz\u00e1lez, our third goalkeeper who has never played at our senior club.\n\n~~Cama &amp; Fede are ready to be the goalkeepers.~~ (lol jk)\n\nNow Madrid are in the title race in the laliga standings.\n\nWho do you think is the best option for the goalkeeper who should play in tomorrow match against Valencia?",
