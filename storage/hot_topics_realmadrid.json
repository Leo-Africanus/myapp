        "content": "I know we won 6-1, it was amazing to watch us dominate an opponent this way after back to back lows and Vini played well. But I wouldn't give in to thought that we are so back and Vini will be great again because we played against a team which was playing higher and we could counter well. \n\nI haven't forgotten the matches against teams that play a low block and Vini instead of passing the ball back attempts a 1v3 dribble loses the ball and complains instead of tracking back, and we get fucked on the counter. The second thing I want to point out, we have seen the flashes of good all the time in the past 1 year but they came very sporadically and he wasn't consistent at all, even wingers like Sterling and Walcott could produce flashes of Brilliance once in 5-7 games, the reason they are not considered the best is because they weren't consistent. Then comes the time when the coach subs him off he does nothing but complain and  finally says, I'll leave the club, that's a cardinal sin in my eyes because the club has always discarded players who have done this.And if you're playing shit we have amazing players like Brahim and Gonzalo that can come in and change the game. And to the Vini fans this wasn't just a Xabi thing he did this with Ancelotti as well but Ancelotti being Ancelotti played it down.\n\nAll we need is for him to be consistent, complain less and if you're playing shit, be quiet when you're substituted or benched the next game. Pass the ball when you are outnumbered and when the opposition team is playing a low block, because you clearly don't know how to break it down.And finally don't ask Cristiano Ronaldo money if you can't put up Cristiano Ronaldo numbers.\n\nAbove All Hala Madrid, the club has seen many Vinis and many better than Vini, and they'll continue to do so because this is the biggest Football club in the history of football.",
