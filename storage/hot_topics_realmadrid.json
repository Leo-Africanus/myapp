In my eyes he wasn\u2019t doing completely bad last season so I don\u2019t understand why he isn\u2019t having a chance at least. He has a lot of talent in finishing, has good pace and he utilizes his body well. Ofc he wasn\u2019t great either but I think he deserves a chance to prove himself. Gonzalo Garcia was great in Club WC but since then he also didn\u2019t catch up on that. Rumors are starting that Endrick is getting sold in January or after the season. \nCan you guys give me your opinion or is there insider information on why Endrick doesn\u2019t play? Should he play or go? Maybe on loan?",

I just wanna point out that Ancelotti knew what he was doing more than we knew. One of the major problems right now is that we don\u2019t have that much players that fit the profile Xabi needs. On the other sides, some players like Guler are fitting in perfectly. Ancelotti never played him since it didn\u2019t fit his tactics. Ancelotti played a counter attacking game, which led to many saying he had no tactics. The whole point of his style was giving free movement to his players and focusing on countering. Even I thought that he didn\u2019t have much tactics. However, I think he understood the type of players Madrid had and hence chose to play like that. If you notice, even now, we play better on the counter and fast attacks. Xabi ball has been great but has some flaws since we do not have much creative players, this was seen against Atl\u00e9tico, or momentarily against other teams. I hope Xabi can make things work, and now I understand why Ancelotti was a pretty good coach overall. ",

Fede has been one of the best soldiers playing wherever is needed for so many games in a row, nobody should talk shit about him. \n\n  \nYesterday against Villarreal I think I heard Santiago Bernabaue sing \"Fe-De-Rico-Val-Ver--De\" to the rythm of Seven Nation Army,  and Fede responded with a thumbs-up, that was pretty satisfying,\n\nMILF \n\nMan I Love FedeValverde ",

        "content": "I feel like he can play there against weaker teams but when it comes to the strong teams he definitely can't because his pace is nowhere near good enough for it. To me his best postiton is where guler's currently playing, I mean he was even playing there in his most recent argentina game so it makes sense. In big games valverde should probably be our RW, especially against barca because we're going to need pace on that right side, and also his crossing is very good.",
