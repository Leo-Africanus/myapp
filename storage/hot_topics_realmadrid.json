        "title": "Sergio Ramo's 92:48 equalizer is by far the most important in our club's history...",
        "content": "After watching Barcelona\u2019s second leg against Inter Milan, I\u2019ve started to think that even us Real Madrid fans, don\u2019t fully grasp just how unbelievable it is to have won 15 Champions League titles. This Barcelona team looked capable of beating anyone in the world, pulling off comebacks after comebacks. Yet, they didn\u2019t win it. Because in the end it all comes down to mentality- something they\u2019ve lacked for most of the past decade.\n\nWe won the Champions League in 2002 with a superb team featuring Raul, Zidane, Makelele, Figo, Hierro, and Roberto Carlos. After that, we signed even more global superstars like Ronaldo Nazario, David Beckham etc, only to face repeated humiliation in the Champions League. Were we not good enough? No, we simply lacked that X-factor.\n\nBy 2012, we had a phenomenal team under Mourinho that managed to stop one of the best Barcelona sides in history from winning La Liga. But we still bottled the semifinals against Bayern Munich, a tie we absolutely should have won. Ig it was just destiny at the end.\n\nThen came 2014. We reached the final against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. They took the lead around the 30th minute and defended with everything they had for the rest of the game. We created plenty of chances, many of which should have been finished, but we failed to convert them. By the 85th minute, I had given up hope. Most of us had. After a decade of coming up short in these kinds of moments, it felt all too familiar. But then came that iconic Ramos header in stoppage time, and everything changed. For the first time in what felt like forever, we came back from behind in a Champions League knockout game. From that point on, the victory felt inevitable. Atl\u00e9tico were drained, and we finished the job. But it had an ever-lasting impact on this club's legacy.\n\nSince then, we\u2019ve gone on to win five more Champions League titles. Each run has been filled with close matches and incredible comebacks. Whether you call it luck or the X-factor, there\u2019s something unique about this club. We simply don\u2019t give up.\n\nAnother reason for our success is our adaptability. Against Manchester City in both 2022 and 2024, we defended with everything we had. A lot of big clubs wouldn\u2019t do that, out of pride or because they\u2019re married to a particular style. We aren\u2019t tied down by ideology. Look at Barcelona. After taking the lead against Inter, they kept trying to score again instead of wasting time and locking the game down because they didn\u2019t want to go against their principles. That stupid decision cost them a place in the Champions League final.\n\nMoreover, since 2014, nearly every major club has suffered heartbreak in the Champions League. Every single one\u2014except Real Madrid. And in the end, it all comes down to that one Ramos header.",

Also, dont get why people say \u201ches unproven\u201d. When you play week in week out for such a good side and get called up for spain and is the starting cb, idk how much more proven you can find at his age. Secondly, the boy is a Madrid fan. He seemingly loves madrid and his fav is our very own Ramos. Finally, his price. I know his release clause of 50m is a bit steep and madrid has refrained for going for high cost players lately but the fact that they dont have to outbid any clubs and the player himself is willing to join makes everything so much more straightforward. I say get the guy in",
