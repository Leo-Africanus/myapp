Overall, the lead is deserved however \n\n46' - 2nd half underway \n\n\u26bd 56' - GOLLLL DEL CASTILLA - fast attack with lots of space for Pol Fortuny - Gonzalo makes the run into the box and Pol puts an easy pass into his run, Gonzalo's first touch is perfect, and he finishes softly with the inside of his boot against the far post and into the net! \n\n\u26bd 58' - goal for Marbella right after the kick off - and it's our former player Jos\u00e9 Callej\u00f3n who scores, just like in the first match. He initiates the attack himself, dribbling past our midfield and playing it out wide - his teammate lays it off to him in the box with the back of his heel, and he comes running at the ball full speed to finish it past Fran \n\n60' - massive chance to immediately restore the 2-goal lead, another top cross from Yusi from the left to the far post, where Pol Fortuny broke free of his marker but sadly has to finish on the volley with this weak foot, and he puts it just wide of the far post \n\n\u26bd 65' - GOLLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - Marbella take risks and leave lots of space for us to counter - Ribes recovers the ball at the edge of our box, plays it to Chema, who launches a perfect long ball to Victor Mu\u00f1oz - who once again escapes his opponents, and squares it perfecrly to Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, he pokes it past the keeper with the tip of his boot for the 3-1! \n\n70' - Gonzalo hits the post, what a play by him! - he is through on the left side in a 2v3 counter, he takes on the fullback and turns past him with a quick change of direction, then he leaves another opponent behind in the same manner, his finish is almost perfect, but it hits the post, runs across the goal line and goes out for a goal kick on the other side \n\n\ud83d\udd04 74' - triple sub, Yusi, Chema and Z\u00fa\u00f1iga off for Valde, Antonio David and Campos\n\n80' - big chance for V\u00edctor to seal the match, Pol Fortuny releases a through ball for him to chase, and once again he launches like a rocket and outruns the defender by a bit margin, but he fails to put his finish on target with only the keeper to bear\n\n\ud83d\udd04 81' - C\u00e9sar Palacios is back from his ACL tear after 9 months! He comes on for Pol Fortuny. \n\n\ud83d\udd04 90' - last sub, Borja for V\u00edctor \n\n\u26bd 90'+2 - goal for Marbella, golazo by Soto - a bit out of nowhere, he cuts inside from the right wing and blasts an absolute missile out with his left foot, it hits the net in the top left corner \n\n90'+4 - good chance for Marbella for the late equaliser, Ribes fails to clear a ball in our box and the Marbella player fires the rebound over the bar \n\nFT - victory that became unnecessarily tight in the end, with Castilla wasting chances on the counter and Marbella getting a lifeline in added time with a great goal. The team keeps the possibilities of reaching the playoffs alive with this win, but it will still be very difficult, 4 points behind the last playoff spots with only 3 matches to go \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 18:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee**: \u00c1lvaro C\u00e1novas Garc\u00eda-Villarrubia\n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 2, Matchday 35\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[FEF TV](https://feftv.com) (subscription - 12.99\u20ac/month)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (5-2-3): Fran Gonz\u00e1lez - Youssef Enr\u00edquez \u2018Yusi\u2019 (74' V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as 'Valde'), Edgar Pujol, Mario Rivas, Quique Ribes, David Jim\u00e9nez - Jos\u00e9 Maria Andr\u00e9s \u2018Chema\u2019 (74' Antonio David), Pol Fortuny (81' C\u00e9sar Palacios) - Gonzalo Garc\u00eda, Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga (74' Andr\u00e9s Campos), V\u00edctor Mu\u00f1oz (90' Borja Alonso) \n\nBench: Mario de Luis (GK), Diego Pi\u00f1eiro (GK), Lorenzo Aguado, David Ruiz, Babacar Diocou. \n\nUnavailable: Ra\u00fal Asencio (first team call-up), Jacobo Ram\u00f3n (first team call-up), David Cuenca (pubalgia), Manuel \u00c1ngel (?), Jeremy de Le\u00f3n (shoulder injury). \n\nCoach: Ra\u00fal\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** DDDWL\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 10th | 46pt | 10-16-8 | 51:34\n",

        "content": "I love Carlo. he's 100% the best manager we've ever had and he's at worst top 3 best managers ever, for me he is, but I could see the argument for Ferguson or Guardiola being top 1-3 as well.\n\nHaving said that, he's just too stubborn when things clearly are not going well. My man played Arda like 1 La liga match, then threw him to the sharks against Liverpool, one of the thoughest matches on the season and then vanished him to the shadow realm. \n\nThen today, he takes him out when Vini was having a horrible match, yet Arda was subbed...ok. He also subbed Ra\u00fal when Tchouameni is one yellow card away from not being able to play the next match... ok. \n\nI've seen so much hate towards Tcho and Lucas, but how can a player perform when they are played out of their position so much? Tchou shows his worth when he's played at the midfield and to me, not renewing Lucas is a mistake. He's huge on the locker room, he's cold af on penalties, which is very relevant. But sure, we'll crucify him cause he's a right winger being played as an RB pretty much the whole season.\n\nSure Florentino is at fault the most here, the team has been poorly planned and we're lucky that Carvajal didn't get another serious injury in the last 3-4 years, that we had Nacho, who could have been a starter for 99% of teams in Europe.\n\nYet, with all this, Carlo is definitely not making the best choices with the players he had. Why play Tchou as a CB for like half of the season when Ra\u00fal was there? Why insist on Lucas at RB, when Fede is clearly better and he had some kids he could have at least tried? It sucks to lose Fede at the midfield, but I'm sure it sucks more to keep getting scorched on Lucas' side every match.\n\nWhy banish Arda to the shadow realm after the Euros he had, just cause of 2 bad matches? Why is Endrick still playing basically no minutes? If you don't plan to really use them anyways, why not loan them so they can get minutes develop and come back next season as better players? I love Carlo, but he's too set on his old ways and yes, that has worked for us before, but it clearly doesn't anymore.",

And naturally, with all the frustration around us having too many similar profile forwards on at the same time in Vini, Mbappe, Rodrygo, does this spell the end for Rodrygo?? I love Rodrygo to bits. This season from him makes me sad and I want see him thrive at Madrid but...can a more tactical coach figure this out??",

        "content": "I am seeing a lot of people that compare Arda to Kroos here due to his playmaking abilities, and even though I think that Arda could do well in that role, I think that it'd would be a waste of his abilities in the final third. \n\nHe has crazy good shooting and crossing, and has the potential to hit crazy amounts of G/A when he develops into a starter(which could be sooner than expected). His ideal role is probably the play as a #8 and #10 hybrid like KDB, he can still help the build-up with his playmaking but his best quality is his goalscoring and chance creation ability as shown today. Also have to mention that Arda is #4 among most big chances created in LaLiga this season in this team with 9 big chances created, while Vini has 10 and Bellingham has only 4 despite playing a lot more.\n\nThe only problem is that Bellingham has been playing this role already, I wonder how a midfield would work if Bellingham played as a box-to-box with Arda getting more freedom in offense as a midfielder. Curious to see what Xabi is gonna do next season.",

We\u2019ve criticized Ancelotti, and we always do. We\u2019ve criticized Florentino P\u00e9rez and the board, and we always do. Everyone bears some responsibility.\n\nBut let\u2019s be clear\u2014this is not an isolated incident, nor is it the only match with this many poor refereeing decisions going against Real Madrid.\n\nIt\u2019s always important to highlight the responsibility of the coaching staff and the club\u2019s management first, but that doesn\u2019t mean we should ignore how much Real Madrid has been harmed by refereeing this season. Today\u2019s match was just another example.\n\nAt any moment, Celta could\u2019ve equalized\u2014and had that happened, Madrid would\u2019ve officially been out of the La Liga title race. A race that could\u2019ve been over long ago if not for poor decisions\u2014both from within the club and, more importantly, from the referees.\n\nIf that had happened, we\u2019d be criticizing Mbapp\u00e9 and Vinicius Jr. for missed chances, we\u2019d criticize Ancelotti for his substitutions, and other players for poor decisions. But with a better referee today, the outcome could\u2019ve been completely different.\n\nAnyway, congrats on the win. Ancelotti and the players need to keep doing their part. There are four matches left\u2014Barcelona, Mallorca, Sevilla, and Real Sociedad. Winning all four doesn\u2019t guarantee La Liga, but we need to do our part and hope for a slip-up from our rivals.\n\nI hate being in this situation, but it\u2019s partly our own doing. Still, let\u2019s not forget the external factors. I just hope Ancelotti leaves with a legacy we\u2019ll always remember fondly.",
