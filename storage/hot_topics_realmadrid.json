There are multiple games where Courtois leaves the game with only one save, which is something that never happened last year.\n\nWe've had injury problems since the CWC, meaning he hasnt had the full squad to play with. Jude is a big-time player for us and is just now coming back from injury. It takes time to find the right role for each player. There's also Cama, Trent, Carvajal, Rudiger, and Dean. Not saying there will be a point where everyone is healthy, but for now I want results when the key players come back is when we should expect the style of play to improve",

        "content": "**We ended the European matchday with three wins and two defeats, thank goodness for the Premier League.** Athletic won their match against Qarabag, who are proving to be a tough opponent, despite Nico not finding his form and his brother I\u00f1aki suffering a muscle injury. It was a comfortable and much-needed victory, which should stabilise Athletic in the competition.\n\n**But all eyes were on the Bernab\u00e9u,** where the first thing to say is that G\u00fcler has definitely won over the team. In addition to the quality of his left foot and his splendid vision, he has shown impeccable dedication, becoming the ideal Real Madrid player since the days of Di St\u00e9fano: half artist, half warrior. In addition, he is an impeccable corner kick taker, a skill he had numerous opportunities to show off in the first half. Practically all of his corners, from either side, were headed, except when he allowed himself to take an open, precise shot to Valverde to strike outside the area.\n\n**Juve made it a very difficult game for Madrid.** Very tight and sprinkling counterattacks (three very early on created panic), they were very tough to beat. Let's say, before it's too late, that Courtois was enormous. He played his 300th game and kept his 119th clean sheet. Di Gregorio was also very good, with Madrid managing to get to him only a few times, but with danger.\n\n**It took extraordinary efforts from Madrid's extraordinary players** to achieve this. In the first half, Mbapp\u00e9 made a sensational move that ended in a high shot from Militao. In the second half, a devastating move by Vinicius ended with his own shot hitting the post, which was finished off by Bellingham, who will welcome this goal. He is still not back to his best, but I have the impression that he has been improving with every game.\n\n**Mbapp\u00e9 left this time without scoring because of Di Gregorio,** who saved three superb shots, but he is still in good form. For him, trapped in the cage set up by Juve, it was a difficult night. All in all, Madrid has three wins and is among the group of co-leaders, although with a worse goal difference than others.",
