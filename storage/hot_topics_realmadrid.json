They believe the time has come to say goodbye to some players and to open the doors to let in the desire that has been lacking at times, just as Courtois described yesterday with the words of the wingers dropping back and helping the full-back.\n\nLucas V\u00e1zquez and Modric, due to their contract expiry, are the first, but not the only ones. Between now and the end of the season, some will be playing for their continuity. The atmosphere in the locker room isn't what it was in previous years. We will once again be very clear with them and remind them that whoever doesn't want to be there, shouldn't. The door is ajar for anyone who hesitates.",

        "title": "In Defense of Rodrygo, the whole right side of the attack has been really poor since the Carvajal injury",
        "content": "I've been reading a lot of comments on this thread and this post isn't to have a go at anyone even though I wholeheartedly disagree that Rodrygo needs to go anywhere, but I am also one of the first people to realize that Rodrygo seems to fade in games a lot after 50 to 60 minutes. \n\nHe seems to always start very strong and then just disappears whereas Vini is always dangerous till the final whistle which is why when a sub needs to be made in attack Ancelotti usually takes him out instead of Vini.\n\nOne thing I think we have all forgotten to take into account however is that he is missing arguably the best right back in the world on his side for pretty much the whole season. The truth is that Rodrygo, Valverde and every player on the right side of the attack plays significantly better when Carvajal is on the pitch.\n\nThe truth is while Vazquez is decent going forward which is expected as a former right winger, he's a complete liability defensively and the whole team suffers for it as there defensive output all triple due to the major gaps he constantly leaves and his inability to actually mark anyone. \n\nYou just simply have to watch any highlights of him vs Carvajal defending to see this. The reason the left side is better is also for this precise reason, Mendy and even Fran are SIGNIFICANTLY better than Vazquez defensively so Vini rarely has to do as much defending which means he can focus more on attack.\n\nObviously there's other issues in the team beyond this but I'm just saying to not be too harsh on Rodrygo. This is also why I worry about signing Trent now because he cannot do what Carvajal does defensive wise and honestly I don't think Trent is also that much better than Carvajal offensively.\n\nWhat i do know is this is going to have to start playing some serious high pressing football from the attack if we do sign Trent.",

        "title": "My analysis of Carlo's second tenure",
        "content": "This is my thoughts on Carlo's second tenure, its a bit long:\n\n2021/22 we had a balanced team. When you combined it with individual brilliance it can create moments/phases of brilliance and thats what we saw in the CL Knockouts. I'll also add that in 2021/22 we were lacking something until Carlo finally realised that KCM doesn't work and they needed help. He then put Valverde at RW to bring more balance. For a majority part of the tie we were inferior against PSG, City and in the final Liverpool for majority of the game. The only tie I could think of where we were better was the 1st leg against Chelsea, but the 2nd leg... well we all know what almost happened. Our balance squad combining with experience allowed us to hang in there and the moments of individual brilliance from Benzema, Modric, Rodrygo, Vini etc managed to pull us through.\n\n2022/23 we lost Casemiro and that was a HUGE defensive downgrade. Tchouameni had a huge decline after the WC, Camavinga was put on LB shift because Mendy was basically out for majority of the season + he doesn't have the positional discipline and awareness to play the DM role and Kroos as a 6 didn't work because Kroos just doesn't provide enough defensive coverage. Valverde RW experiment came to an end, because he just isn't dynamic enough going forward. On top of that Benzema had a huge fall off as well and our attack became extremely predictable because everything was flowing and only through Vini. The Alaba + Militao duo also had a huge drop in levels. When he finally decided to stop the Valverde experiment and played Rodrygo on the right we immediately saw improvement (beat Barca 4-0)\n\n2023/24 arguably the best defensive Real Madrid team I've ever seen. With Benzema gone, we went back to a 4 midfield set up, but this time we have someone who is creative, has great goal scoring instinct, defensive workrate, basically just the total package in Jude. The balance was back with the diamond. Granted, we still struggled to dominate games. The first Clasico was a disaster till Modric came on and Jude managed to pull off a brace. We barely scrapped past Leipzig, City dominated us for 3/4 part of the tie and needed  individual brilliance from Joselu to help us beat arguably the worst Bayern side in about 2 decades and got dominated by Dortmund in the first half. The team's defense managed to keep us in the game, this is something I'll give huge credit to Carlo. The defense kept us in the game and Vini, Bellingham and Rodrygo will always somehow find a goal or two to help us pull through. I'd also like to add that Kroos learned to play more as a 6. On paper Tchouameni is the DM, but in game Kroos is the one playing deeper and has significantly improved his defensive side of the game.\n\n2024/25 arguably the worst Madrid side I've ever seen. Lost Kroos = no control. Mbappe clearly isn't a striker. Jude given a different role. Injuries + Nacho's departure etc I can go on all day, but this team lacks balance. It feels like this team is playing with 4 attackers, it lacks control. On top of that, to make it even worse both Mbappe and Vini, they don't track back, they don't press AND they don't run !!! We have one of the worst distance covered by a big team in Europe. My opinion is that Rodrygo should've been dropped for an extra midfielder, but Carlo doesn't wanna upset the quartet upfront. There are no structure, no identity and no style of play. Every game is like Carlo fields starting XI he chose and let them do what they want and hoping that they can create something amongst themselves. The defense... I am not even gonna go in on that we all know what's happening. In the modern game you cannot afford to have two players who don't track back at all. You can barely get away with one nowadays, let alone two. Honestly it's frustrating Carlo doesn't give them a huge scolding for this because it is benchable behaviour.\n\nRegardless of the injuries, the squad depth or Vazquez being a liability at RB, this team should be playing WAY better than they are playing right now end of story. It's not Carlo's fault that the board doesn't bring in the players he want or reinforce the squad, but it's his fault that the players don't run, don't press and don't track back. It's his fault that he kept allowing this to happen again and again and again with no repercussions. Its his fault that he isn't authoritative enough to demand more from his players. It's simple, you don't follow instructions = bench, doesn't matter who you are. Carlo might not be the best tactical coach or gives the best instructions, but with the players he has available, this level of performance is disgustingly bad.\n\nHoping the next manager will have more authority and demands from the players. The next manager need to take control of the dressing room and insert his authority because this squad rn are full of entitled and lazy players that they know there won't be any consequences no matter what under Carlo.",

They\u2019re the face of modern football. The poster boys. The dreamers. But football, at its core, isn\u2019t just about dreams.It\u2019s about balance.And in the end, defense is what keeps those dreams alive.Let me tell you something painful \u2014 something no Madridista wants to hear:\n\nWe\u2019ve conceded 12 goals in our last five games.Four of those... at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u. Yes, the fortress. The cathedral of European football. Breached. Shattered. And the harshest part? It\u2019s not fiction. It\u2019s not drama. It\u2019s the truth.\n\n\u00c9der Milit\u00e3o. David Alaba. Two warriors \u2014 fallen, broken, out with long-term injuries.And how did our board react to this crisis? They didn\u2019t. No backup. No emergency loan. No reinforcement.They watched as our defense withered \u2014 and did nothing. You don\u2019t enter a Champions League knockout stage with two fit center-backs and call that a strategy. You call that madness.You call that neglect. Antonio R\u00fcdiger \u2014 31, battle-worn, carrying the backline on his shoulders.He has bled for this badge. Fought like a soldier possessed.But even he is human.In the last few matches, we saw him drained.We saw mistakes. We saw the toll.This wasn\u2019t the R\u00fcdiger we know.\n\nThis was a man pushed to the edge, left to fight alone.After Carvajal's ACL INJURY what did our board do? We didn\u2019t sign a right-back. We didn\u2019t even take a gamble on a loan. Walker was available \u2014 maybe not a perfect fit, but certainly more of a defender than Lucas V\u00e1zquez, a winger shoved into defense, left to fend off elite attackers while we crossed our fingers and prayed. Now we stand exposed.Tactically. Physically. Emotionally.The gamble backfired.And we\u2019re paying the price.This isn\u2019t just about losing games. It\u2019s about losing standards.It\u2019s about watching Real Madrid \u2014 the club of Di St\u00e9fano, of Ramos, of legends \u2014 be run like a team that fears ambition.Florentino P\u00e9rez has made this mistake before. The Gal\u00e1cticos era.All attack, no balance.Selling Makelele was the beginning of that downfall. I thought he had learned. He didn\u2019t..\n\nTonight, we find out something bigger than tactics.We find out who truly cares about the crest on their chest.Who plays for the fans \u2014 not just the fame.Because it\u2019s okay to lose. You can\u2019t win the Champions League every year. But what\u2019s not okay\u2026 is to not give everything. Look at Inter Milan. Look at Arsenal.\n\nThe two best defensive units in this year\u2019s Champions League. Neither had flawless attacks. Arsenal were without a proper No. 9 for much of the season. Saka was injured for a long time. Martinelli, inconsistent.Yet here they are \u2014 within touching distance of their first UCL trophy .Why?Because they defended. As a team. As a family. Inter? They have Lautaro. But beyond that?No one in that front line truly terrifies defenses the way ours did.Yet they\u2019re in the semis. Why? Because their structure held firm. Their backline gave them life.That\u2019s the difference.\n\nDefense gives you a foundation. Without it, you\u2019re building castles in the sand\n\n\u2014and no amount of attacking magic can save you from the tide.If we repeat the same mistake with Xabi, it won\u2019t just be an error\u2014\n\nit will be a crime against everything we claim to stand for. Time and again, we\u2019ve shackled our coaches, denied them the support and the reinforcements they needed. And time and again, we\u2019ve watched our dreams shatter\n\n\u2014fragile as glass\u2014\n\nunder the weight of our own stubbornness. We cannot afford another heartbreak.\n\nIf Xabi comes, let Xabi lead. Let him build. Or prepare to watch it all fall apart once more.",

        "title": "The Club World Cup alters plans for making the decision on the coach",
        "content": "(English Translation)\n\nWith the tough Champions League elimination against Arsenal over, the time has come for Real Madrid to analyze and make decisions. Not for next season, but rather for the end of this season. There's no time to waste. In any other year, they would wait until the end of the season, as they usually do, but this one is very different because the big objective they still have left isn't the league title or even the Copa del Rey final, no matter how tempting Bar\u00e7a might be as their opponent. None of that. The main challenge now is this first Club World Cup, which Florentino P\u00e9rez and Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel S\u00e1nchez have had on their agenda since the start of the season. For reasons of prestige, international exposure, and brand positioning in a key market like North America, winning the first edition of the brand-new FIFA tournament is considered a strategic objective. Therefore, they are considering what the best option might be to face this competition with the greatest possible guarantees.\n\n# Feeling of a completed cycle\n\nWe're talking about the coach, of course. Carlo Ancelotti has lost a lot of face this season, and his poor performance in the two legs of the knockout stage against Arsenal reinforces the notion among those in charge that the squad has long since let go of the Italian manager and his time is over. Normally, he'd play in the Copa del Rey final, and at the end of the season, unless there was a radical turnaround in the team's play and he won both titles, they would agree to terminate his contract as head coach and offer him a grateful exit, in keeping with his impeccable record. Furthermore, the Brazilian Football Federation has been waiting for him for over a year and would like to sign him in June.\n\n# A caretaker or Xabi Alonso ready for the Club World Cup\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that La Liga ends on May 25th, and Real Madrid's Club World Cup debut on June 18th against Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal. The club is exploring alternative options to Ancelotti taking charge if the team's erratic form continues or even worsens after the Copa del Rey final. It's about anticipating all possible scenarios. One option would be to appoint an interim manager, which could be Solari or Ra\u00fal. But the most suitable option would be for the new coach to take charge of the team weeks before the Club World Cup to work with the players, although many international players will be playing in the Nations League finals between June 4th and 8th or in World Cup qualifiers with their South American national teams. That new manager would be Xabi Alonso because he is the option that most convinces the president. The Tolosa native remains focused on his Bayer Leverkusen side, although he's waiting for a call from Real Madrid to activate the release clause that allows him to leave if Real Madrid or Liverpool (but not Bayern Munich) want him, in exchange for a fee as compensation for not seeing out the remaining season on his contract. It's another matter whether Xabi would welcome the option of taking charge in June of a team that's physically and mentally tired, ready to face a tournament as demanding as the month-long Club World Cup at the end of the season.\n\n\\---\n\nBased on this article we could have a new manager finalized within a month and officially signed before 1st June. I recently wrote a post on this sub related to this topic...\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/realmadrid/comments/1k15qcr/timing\\_of\\_ancelotti\\_departure\\_and\\_xabi\\_arrival/](https://www.reddit.com/r/realmadrid/comments/1k15qcr/timing_of_ancelotti_departure_and_xabi_arrival/)",

        "content": "Our squad might be imblanaced especially in our attack but the right manager can find a way to make things work.\n\nBarca is a prime example of a managerial change completely turning things around. We even saw how Zizou shifted things when we sacked benetiz. Sometimes it is not that the coach is bad, it is because the coach's managerial style does not fit with the resources at his disposal. I think our team is perfect for a pressing style manager like Klopp while Alonso might being something new ro the managerial world as a young blood\n\nWe also will find a solution to our Kroos problem in Trent, Trent is probably is the best long ball and through ball passer in the world and both managerial options Klopp and Alonso can bring he best out of him. Alonso loves to play with wingback which is a position Trent will excel in and Klopp was the one who managed trent for 9 years in liverpool. \n\nI keep seeing reports that we might wait for Copa del rey to decide to sack him or not. If we win, what is next? What if we win that one game and we face the same issues next season.",

        "title": "It\u2019s easy to blame Ancelotti, but what about Florentino?",
        "content": "This season, we got hit with a huge reality check, it really showed how important Toni Kroos was to this team. We started off completely unbalanced, with no ideas and the whole squad felt disconnected. Then Ceballos started getting more minutes and gave us a bit of hope. Suddenly there was more creativity and better flow, but even that wasn\u2019t enough, since he\u2019s an injury prone player.\n\nThen our defense collapsed. Carvajal got injured, and we were left with just V\u00e1zquez? and he\u2019s not even a RB. Nacho left and we didn\u2019t bring in a replacement. Relying on a 32 year old ACL injured Alaba, and keeping Vallejo the tourist, who stayed just because Florentino felt bad for him, and that\u2019s about it.\n\nMilit\u00e3o got injured, and out of all that negativity came one positive: Ra\u00fal Asencio. But even then, it took Carlo a few games to see it, choosing Tchouam\u00e9ni over him at first. Few players have been playing out of position and worn out, and who\u2019s to blame for that? \n\nSo how did we fail to bring in what we needed, especially a RB or CB? Particularly in January after the Cl\u00e1sico disaster. We all know Carlo asked for signings, but also why not give the academy players a chance as well?\n\nYes, there are many questions and this season has been a disaster. Injuries, Ancelotti\u2019s poor decisions, lack of tactics, no real rotation, over-reliance on individual brilliance up front and overall weak management have only made things worse. But seriously what are Florentino and the board even thinking?\n\n\nHonestly, it feels like Florentino has been more focused on helping Bar\u00e7a this season than fixing our own problems. It\u2019s clear he and the board are just as much to blame.\n\nThis is Real Madrid, and we\u2019ve been suffering since day one this season and it\u2019s been embarrassing, yet here we are, chasing free agents like a mid-table team and we\u2019ve worn out our players by playing them out of position. And the timing couldn\u2019t be worse because Bar\u00e7a have been unstoppable this season.\n\nI guess it\u2019s karma for all the laughs and mockery aimed at them and Xavi. But one thing\u2019s for sure, we\u2019re not going to suffer for years like a corrupt, broke club like Bar\u00e7a. I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll rise and dominate again. That\u2019s one of the many things I\u2019m proud of with this club, we lose players, but we rise quickly. We don\u2019t suffer for seasons like others do, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll bounce back next year.\n\nSo many question marks this season, but that\u2019s football. Sometimes this is what it takes to start over again. I know that we Madridistas are the most demanding fans in the world, but we have a reason to be and I know many of us feel the same way.\n\nI just hope Florentino and the board have learned from all of this during his final years as president, and I hope our next manager can bring us that joy again. I\u2019m grateful for everything Don Carlo Ancelotti has done for this team, but it\u2019s time for a new era.\n\nI just needed to get that off my chest.\n\nHALA MADRID!\n",

        "content": "HEAR ME OUT! I know this is a stupid title but i just had an idea how to make this team click the next season. Obviously I am no manager, but I will try my best. Please mention you thoughts down below.\n\n**Manager:** Ancelotti is great, but a more tempting option ATP is Xabi Alonso/Zidane.\n\n**Transfers:** Sell Alaba, Vallejo and Modric(?). Loan a proper LB like Tagliafico and buy Raphael Guerreiro next summer. Zubimendi is rumoured to come in to our side which is great as he is defensively sound and is also an aerial threat. Nico Paz, who we have loaned out to Como is on absolute fire. He could bring the creativity we need.\n\n**Formation: 4-3-3 Defend / 4-3-3 False 9** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2zpz94xcfqve1.png?width=475&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1eb9403a22841e047ba1658b6b09ab10ae471289\n\n\u00a0I personally think this might work, ESPECIALLY if the coach benches Vini and plays Mbappe and Endrick. Vazquez, Camavinga, Carvajal, Ceballos(after recovery), Arda and Brahim provide depth to our squad and we can rotate unlike this season.\n\n**While attacking or in possession**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ctul30v7gqve1.png?width=473&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d89f4e24ec027bb742bcde4a4fb1fc578a67f5a1\n\nWith Carvajal / TAA , Zubimendi and our unlimited midfield combos, passes into our attacking third will increase, But our forwards really need to click.\n\n\u00a0**While defending** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yvp7hcergqve1.png?width=478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c51399f6c0ef66e3e32ec2b0ac6ba0131a1ebc80\n\nI have gone with a Mourinho Madrid style, perfect for pacy counters with our front 3. But the front 3 needs to do more defensively\u00a0.\n\n**MBAPPE:**  This might sound dumb, but I think Mbappe needs more time to adapt. While he certainly has an eye for goal. he needs to learn how to move like a Kane. Dont forget that even Cristiano played as a 9 only since that 2011 CDR final vs Barca\n\n**Please share you thoughts on this and what would you suggest for next season??** \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0",
