        "content": "Last season with the vulnerability we had on that right side he was forced back to cover the space and then blamed for his attacking stats, but still he helped us get past City and Atleti in champions. This man has been training with the best for 6 years now and already a legend with the crucial goals he has scored and trophies he has won. This season will be different and with the quality squad depth Xabi has at his disposal, we will be back on top. Maybe Rodrygo will leave next season for a guranteed starting role, but this season Xabi will prove to him how effective he can be under his system. That match against Oviedo with 17 shots in the first half is a glimpse of the low block monster Rodrygo is. People want to compare Rodrygo to Vini, but they are different players and have different strengths and weaknesses and with Xabi, the Invincible man, he will take advantage of that versatility. This season, mediapro won't be able to stop us.\n\nEdit:  \nMade the images more visible for people struggling to watch the video. ",

Is this a common and is it because the Spanish National Team heavily favors Barcelona players? (Think back to Gonzalo Garcia).",

        "content": "Every other day, I see our fanbase saying something harsh about Carlo and it breaks my heart. I understand some people never liked the brand of football he offered and last season in particular. I hear you guys. But acting like he was good for nothing and a big problem is such a harsh way to see him.\n\nBut let\u2019s be fair to him please.. On his first stint, he cane to Madrid from PSG when we weren\u2019t at our best. We had won one league title in 5 years and it seemed like we were never gonna win La Decima. He was the manager to finally deliver the league title to PSG and had unlimited money to push for CL there. He came over and he delivered the biggest night in the club history this century. And the reward he got- unfairly dackedyfor Rafa freaking Benitez next season. All the players publicly said they wanted him to stay.. Did he ever say anything bad about us? Nope, he said he is a Madridista just like us.\n\n2022- Zidane had just quit. Real Madrid were struggling to find a manager. Even Max Allegri snubbed us having said yes before. Who comes to the rescue? Carlo Ancelotti. And what does he do? Win us the Champions League against all odds and the league title too. Remember how far away we seemed from the CL title in 2021? And he does it again the best GK in the world, 2 starting CBs out with ACL and no striker other than Joselu..\n\nYes he had bad moments and difficult times.. Is some of his criticism fair? Yes, absolutely.. Does he deserve the abuse we give him? Absolutely not! He came from Milan and became a Madridista. He is very vocal about it. We owe so much to him. And above all, he was a gentleman. He is my favorite manager along with Zidane. Gracias Carlo \u2764\ufe0f",
