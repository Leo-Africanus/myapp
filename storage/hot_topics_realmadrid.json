        "content": "\nThe new Real Madrid under Xabi Alonso is exciting, not because of big signings, but because of the tactical potential and development of players we already have.\n\nPeople keep saying we need a new Kroos. A midfield controller. Someone who dictates tempo, creates passing lanes, and calms the game. And I agree. But that doesn\u2019t mean we need to buy one. Great coaches develop that kind of player.\n\n1. Jude Bellingham\nBellingham absolutely has the tools to become that kind of midfielder. Great ball control, strong in duels, physically dominant, and with the technical quality to pick passes. Yes, he plays further up right now. But remember, Pirlo used to be more attacking before he became a regista. Even Modric made that shift. With the right guidance, Bellingham can evolve into a complete playmaker.\n\n2. Fede Valverde\nAt the start of this season, Valverde was taking on more creative duties in midfield. He was distributing well, linking up play, and breaking lines. That role faded when he had to cover wide areas, but he\u2019s more than capable. His stamina, vision and drive make him a perfect fit for a modern tempo-setter.\n\n3. Eduardo Camavinga\nWhen people mention someone like Angelo Stiller, I always think Camavinga has a very similar profile, and honestly, a much higher ceiling. He\u2019s press-resistant, great on the turn, and reads the game well. Why not develop him instead of looking elsewhere?\n\n4. Arda G\u00fcler\nPhysically he\u2019s less imposing, which makes it harder to see him in that deep role, but in terms of technique, vision, and creativity, Arda\u2019s got it. Under the right coach, he could grow into something special, maybe not as a regista, but definitely as a playmaker between the lines.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m hyped for the Xabi Alonso era. Not because I expect a transfer spree, but because I believe he has the intelligence and background to shape these players into something bigger. We don\u2019t need to spend 60 million on the next \u201ccontroller\u201d when we might already have two or three waiting to explode.\n\nLet them grow. Let them shine. Let\u2019s build something.\n\nHala Madrid.\ud83e\udd0d",

Solari realized it and took off quite a few big names who had past their prime: Marcelo, Bale and Isco. At the same time he gave all the youngster chances, not just Vini but also Ceballos, Llorente and Reguilon. Valverde also had a little time. They could all have been part of the squad. That require a lot of guts and let the next coach could continue with this route.\n\nMy biggest issue with Zizou in his 2nd spell is that he brought back the old veterans and sold/loan most of these players, or not trust them too much. Especially Marcelo shouldn't have gotten that much time.  \n\nHe also made sure Courtois as the 1st keeper.",

        "content": "Hey fellow Madridistas,\n\nI\u2019m still pretty new when it comes to understanding football tactics, but I\u2019ve been trying to learn more lately\u2014especially with the way Barcelona might play under Flick. From what I\u2019ve seen and read, he\u2019s known for a really aggressive high line and intense pressing style, similar to how his teams played in Germany. It got me thinking\u2014how do we actually beat a team like that?\n\nI know Real Madrid has faced teams with similar approaches before, so maybe looking back at some of those games could help. For example, our matches against Klopp\u2019s Liverpool or even Guardiola\u2019s Bayern come to mind. Those teams also pressed high and left space behind. I remember us punishing them on the counter with fast transitions\u2014maybe that\u2019s a clue? If anyone has game suggestions to rewatch, I\u2019d love to check them out and try to understand how we handled those kinds of setups.\n\nAlso, I feel like having players like Vin\u00edcius and Rodrygo really helps, since they\u2019re quick and good at making runs behind the defense. Maybe that\u2019s one of the keys\u2014targeting the space left behind the high line with pace and timing. But I also wonder how we can handle their pressing without losing the ball too much. Is it all about quick passing and good positioning? Or do we need someone like Modri\u0107 to slow things down and control the tempo?\n\nIf anyone here has more tactical knowledge or can explain it in a simple way, I\u2019d really appreciate it. What kind of formation or style usually works best against a team that presses high and pushes their backline so far up? Any specific games you\u2019d recommend watching to learn more about this kind of matchup?\n\nThanks in advance\u2014and Hala Madrid!",

From what it looked like he streams from his living room and on his left (our right), he's got a big window where you can view some of Madrid downtown. If you know who I'm talking about, please drop a link. This Madridista would really appreciate it. ",
