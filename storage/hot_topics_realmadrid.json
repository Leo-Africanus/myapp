        "title": "Xabi Alonso and the Non-Negotiable Work Rate: Will Mbappe or Vini Jr. Face the Bench?",
        "content": "Alright Madristas,\n\nLet's talk about the burning question at Real Madrid under Xabi Alonso: Will he actually bench Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 or Vinicius Jr. if they don't consistently track back and contribute defensively?\n\nWe've all seen the dazzling runs, the insane goals, the moments of pure individual brilliance from these two. But for years, a common criticism, especially of Mbapp\u00e9 at PSG and at times Vini Jr. under Ancelotti, has been their perceived lack of defensive involvement. With Alonso now at the helm, a manager who built a historically disciplined, high-work-rate Bayer Leverkusen side, this issue is amplified.\n\nAlonso's philosophy is crystal clear. He has repeatedly stressed the importance of a collective defensive effort, stating, \"In my view, we ALL have to defend. The 11 players have to press. Vinicius Jr, Jude, Fede Valverde, Mbapp\u00e9. All of them.\" This isn't just lip service; his Leverkusen team operated with an intense, synchronized press and positional discipline that was instrumental to their unbeaten season.\n\nLooking at last season, particularly in the recent Club World Cup semifinal loss to PSG, reports surfaced about Alonso holding \"crunch talks\" with both Mbapp\u00e9 and Vini Jr. regarding their on-field attitudes and defensive work rate. While Mbapp\u00e9's illness might have played a role, the sentiment from the club hierarchy, as reported by Marca, was a concern over the team's lack of fluency and failure to work together defensively, stemming from an alleged lack of effort from the attacking duo.\n\nWe saw glimpses of Vini Jr. putting in more defensive shifts under Ancelotti at times, but it was often inconsistent. Mbapp\u00e9, on the other hand, has a well-documented history of conserving energy for attacking exploits.\n\nSo, the question is: are these world-class talents truly \"non-negotiable\" in Alonso's system, even if their defensive contributions don't meet his rigorous standards? Or will the sheer offensive output outweigh the defensive compromises? Leverkusen's success was built on a strong collective, not just individual brilliance.\nWhat do you all think? Has Xabi Alonso shown enough resolve at Leverkusen to suggest he'd make such a drastic call? Or are Mbapp\u00e9 and Vini Jr. simply too important to ever be benched, forcing Alonso to adapt his system around them? \n",

Do you absolve him of all mentality criticisms of he shows this extreme display of loyalty? \nEDIT: many are saying it\u2019s $1B across 5 years, point still stands though plus he is getting offers for $350M/year.

I know he scored that insane Copa del Rey goal vs Barcelona and the bicycle kick in the UCL final, but I want to know more. What was Bale like in his prime?
