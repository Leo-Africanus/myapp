Getting a creative midfielder isn't gonna change anything, the tactics are the biggest issue and that's why Alonso is here ( no disrespect to Carlo but he lost the plot last season). At the end of the day these players aren't robots, they're insanely talented and can learn to play in any way that Xabi deems necessary.",
