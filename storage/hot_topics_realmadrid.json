        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm so interested in watching the Bernabeu clasico games at the end of the month. Ticket sale hasn't opened yet, only the VIP is (no tickets available anymore apparently, is that permanent tho? Could any VIP tickets show up later?). I'm mainly looking at the official website and entradas com website.\n\nI know that tickets open almost a week before the game kick-off date. For the Madridista premium members, ticket sale opens one day before the general public category. I'm wondering if this would give me more chances to find a ticket rather than waiting for the general public tickets.\n\nThanks!!",
