No one is happy with the current happenings at the club with regard to the recent losses, sacking of Xabi, effort from some players, etc. I want to remind this sub of our rule to use the open thread (OT) for these posts. The purpose of the OT is to have these discussions, and allows for the home page to stay relatively clean. Sometimes we will keep posts up that have 'gained enough traction' (i.e., enough comments, upvotes) but we will be removing posts that do not fit the home page no matter what at this time.

        "content": "Diario AS: Endrick speaks to AS: Brazilian \"could write a book about\" former Real Madrid boss | After scoring on his Lyon debut, the on-loan Real Madrid forward is set for his home bow on Sunday. Ahead of that game, he spoke exclusively to AS. \n\nFrom Marco Ruiz \n\nFull Writeup: \n\n**How have your first days in Lyon been?** \n\nThey\u2019ve been great. I arrived here champing at the bit. It\u2019s been a tough stretch of work, learning everything I need to be able to play, and also handling things off the field with the transfer. I came to give everything for Lyon and finish the season better than the last one. I\u2019m very focused on training, recovery, and my individual work, so I barely have time to leave the house. \n\n**Do you like the city?** \n\nIt\u2019s beautiful. I already had the chance to eat at Bocuse, which is a legendary restaurant here. And I took a walk through the city center and visited the New Balance store. I want to see a lot more, but I also want to keep pushing forward in my preparation. \n\n**What kind of club is Lyon?** \n\nIt\u2019s a highly respected club in France, with plenty of national titles. It has a huge amount of supporters throughout the country. The structure is excellent - we lack for nothing - and the squad is full of players from all over the world. Everyone has given me a really warm welcome; I\u2019m honestly impressed. \n\n**Did you ever dream of such a special debut, scoring the winner in a cup victory over Lille?**\n\nFrom the first ball I touched, I tried to show that we were going to win. It wasn\u2019t a dream. It was a plan. An aim. Go out there and win. Every one of us gave everything, and in attack, I always have to look for the goal. \n\n**How did you feel after that match? Was it a release?** \n\nI came away feeling really happy. Advancing to the next round was very important. Scoring in my first match was special; it\u2019s something I\u2019ve also been able to enjoy doing in other competitions. It shows I can adapt quickly to new tactics and different types of opponents. The group has helped me a lot, and I already feel like I\u2019m part of everything here. \n\n**Was leaving Real Madrid on loan a hard decision to make?** \n\nIn our careers, we have to understand that time is very valuable. When we\u2019re starting out, we need to grow, and to grow, we need to play. Recovering from my injury and all the work for my return kept me out for months, and I knew it would be difficult to get a steady run of matches in Spain. The hard part was the recovery. I came to France to do what I love. Train and play. Chasing our dreams is always a good thing. \n\n**Why did you choose Lyon?** \n\nIt offers everything I need. It plays in a major league, I\u2019m in a country that\u2019s a reference point for high-level soccer, it has a squad with players from all over the world, an excellent coaching staff that likes to attack with a very technical style of play, passionate fans, and it\u2019s also a club with a strong history of success with Brazilian players. You really can\u2019t ask for more. \n\n**How did Lyon head coach Paulo Fonseca sell the club to you?** \n\nPaulo called me and showed me how he likes to prepare his teams, what Lyon was doing, and what the club could do with my arrival. It was clear to me that he would help me a lot, that I\u2019d have a group that would support me, and that I could help them too. He showed me that now we all have to be together. \n\n**Did you ask Madrid\u2019s French players - the likes of Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 - for advice?** \n\nBefore the announcement, I talked to some players, especially the Brazilians who played at Lyon in recent years. After the announcement, several others reached out to talk to me about the club and French soccer. I got a lot of support and encouragement from many people, not just the French, and that was extra motivation. \n\n**What are your goals between now and the end of the season?** \n\nI have one goal each week: to start the next week better than the last one. That will push me to give everything for the club so we can win every match. My objective is to help the team win. If I manage that, I\u2019ll get the best reward: goals and trophies. \n\n**Are you thinking about your return to Madrid?** \n\nI just got here! \\[laughs\\] I haven\u2019t even played my first home game yet. This is not the time to think about going back. Right now, all I\u2019m thinking about is a\u00a0[full stadium](https://en.as.com/soccer/endrick-madness-hits-lyon-with-50000-tickets-sold-to-see-the-brazilian-f202601-n/)\u00a0\\[against Brest\\] on Sunday and seeing our fans. At this moment, I don\u2019t need to worry about anything except Lyon. \n\n**Is Real Madrid still at the center of everything for you?** \n\nMy relationship with Real Madrid hasn\u2019t changed at all. Right up until the day I traveled to Lyon, the club gave me all the support I needed and helped with this move, responding to my request for a loan. \n\n**How tough were these last few months for you?** \n\nThey were tough - I can\u2019t deny it. An injury that keeps a player off the field is always sad. You\u2019re not doing what you love, and sometimes you don\u2019t know when you\u2019ll be able to do it again, or if you\u2019ll do it as well. Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t a serious injury, and the club paid close attention to the recovery process. \n\n**What was the worst moment you\u2019ve had since you left Brazil to move to European soccer?**\n\nFinding out I\u2019d miss the Club World Cup in the United States. That I wouldn\u2019t be able to play for several months. The moment you discover you won\u2019t be able to compete. Losses are painful, but they\u2019re part of football. We all win and lose. Only a few win titles. No one wins all the time. But injuries take you out of the game. \n\n**And how do you evaluate your first season in Spain under then-Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti?** \n\nI wish I could have helped more, but I think it was a season where I learned and grew a lot. I scored on my debut in several competitions and shared the field with some of the best athletes in the world - a world-class team. I can only thank God. \n\n**Do you think you can make Brazil\u2019s World Cup squad?** \n\nI have to believe. I want to be better in the next game - and then the next, and the one after that. I\u2019ve already been with the national team, and if I improve every week, I\u2019ll be better than I was when I was first called up: more experienced and more mature, with more options in my game. I have to prove that I can help any team. \n\n**Did Ancelotti make a big impression on you?** \n\nI could write a book about everything I learned from him. He played at a high level for major clubs and has won everything as a coach in several countries. He taught us so much about the game, but also about the life of a soccer player. \n\n**Did you expect Xabi Alonso\u2019s departure as Real Madrid head coach?** \n\nI made my debut here when the final was played in Saudi Arabia. I wasn\u2019t able to follow the match. I\u2019m very focused on Lyon now, but I\u2019ll always be rooting for everyone who helped me in Madrid, wherever they are. Xabi was a brilliant player, a world champion, a champion as a coach in Germany, and he\u2019ll soon be at a new club or national team. \n\n**And any message for the people who believe in Endrick and expect the best from him?** \n\nI thank God for all the support I receive and ask Him to bless me so I can bring joy to everyone who supports me - to everyone who enjoys watching me play. I fight for my family and teammates, but also for those who support me. ",

        "content": "A big reason why Xabi left was because he was facing a lot of difficulty in managing some of the players. Do you guys think if Luka had been extended for another season, he would have been able to help in controlling the locker room better and making the players more cooperative and perform better? I would assume given his success, experience and age, he defintely is some form of locker-room leader and Luka doesn't seem the type to go against the coach or make things difficult for the coach and the rest of the team. His performance at AC Milan is still at a high level so its not like he would have been a net negative on the pitch. I think Luka would have added some which needed stability to the team.",

        "title": "List of decisions Jose Mourinho took when he was given complete control of the club by Florentino",
        "content": "People often forget our Golden period only started after Jose Mourinho took Over Real Madrid and demanded literally complete control over the club including staff, transfers, youth, and management. There is no other manager who Perez surrendered the club to other than Jose.\n\nWhen Jose arrived, he wanted us to play counter attacking football to compete against Barcelona tiki taka and here are some decisions he took..\n\n* Firstly changed the formation of Real\u2019s 442 that they played since 2000s to a 4231 or 433.\n* Got rid of Guti, who had issues with managers before..and Raul,by promising only a bench role and nothing more..even though Jose wanted him to stay.\n* Signed Ozil to play no 10, and benched a Balon D\u2019or winner Kaka.\n* Signing Di Maria as a winger, Khedira as CDM despite having Lassana, Gago and Granero and signing Ricardo Carvalho despite having Pepe, Garay and Raul Albiol. Important to note Ricardo Carvalho was got to bring in some leadership to the group \n* Got the Castilla coach Alberto Toril sacked because he didn't like how Jese and Nacho were being developed, and wanted to play a young Dani Carvajal in the copa Del Rey in 2011\n* Got Jose Valdano Sacked cause he had criticised Mourinhos tactics before he even joined Madrid. Mourinho eventually became head of Football operations\n* Got Zidane to Be director of football, then got him demoted because of Zidane's criticism\n* Benched Iker Casillas for performance and other reasons, and played Adan.. A Castilla GK to show Iker that nobody is bigger than the team. Then made Diego Lopez his starter even after Iker returned from Injury.\n* Partially converted Ronaldo to a Striker, and Ramos to a full time CB and unleashed a monster out of Ramos and promoted him to captain despite having a feud with him\n* Showed several players their place.. Iker is one example, Replacing Pepe with a young Varane, Made Arbeloa permenant RB in the second half of 2013, Replaced Marcelo for Coentrao to suit his tactics\n* Literally Fought for and got Luka Modric over Santi Carzorla, and David Silva\n* Starting 11 was purely merit based, Benzema had to compete Higuain, Pepe with Varane, Kaka with Ozil, Marcelo with Coentrao. Each place was earned through merit.\n* He went out of the dugout before the game started so that the Bernabeu could boo him and not the players.. for 40 minutes.\n* Openly took on players in the dressing room such as Ozil, Kaka, Benzema, Pepe, Granero, Ramos, Iker, and even Ronaldo if they weren't chasing, tracking back, or making defensive errors.\n* Benched his whole defence in 2013 Jan after seeing it wasn't working..from Iker, Arbeloa,Pepe, Carvalho, Marcelo..to Deigo Lopez, Arbeloa, Ramos, Varane and Coentrao.\n\nUltimately, Ramos and Iker threatened to leave and the entire dressing room revolted against Mourinho. Once he left, Mourinho mentioned that its more about dealing with politics than with football at Real. Just goes to show the problems a manager has to face when he manages the club.\n\nNot advocating a Mourinho return, just highlighting the politics he had to endure and the decisions he took when he was here. If any manager took one of the decisions today, he will have terrible consequences for any manager.\n\nFrom 8 consecutive R16 UCL eliminations to teams like Lyon and Roma, to 3 consecutive UCL SEMIs is a big achievement.\n\nAncelotti succeded cause Mourinho had already prepared the players mentally and tactically. But even he followed what the management ordered him to\n\n* Played Diego Lopez as his La Liga GK, but eventually had to play the worst GK of the 2014 WC, Iker Casillas as his main GK\n* Changed the whole formation to accommodate James Rodriguez and played Odegaard For PR. (Mentions in his book)\n\nAt the end, Real is now all about egos and politics..and sadly it looks like the Galacticos era is back where players hold the ultimate powers, then the club management and last is the manager",

I log in a few days ago and see Xabi sacked and the fanbase divided..? What's going on? What happened? Yes, I'm all caugh up with fixture results, and while they're not amazing, I (personally) don't think these justify sacking a manager and having the fanbase as divided. Is there something else going on that I'm unaware off? I mean, we were essentially begging for the guy and then he's gone just like that half a season in? Is he having problems with Florentino? I just want somebody to explain to me what's going on with Real Madrid cause I don't get it.",

        "content": "Am I the only one bothered by how the main news lately is whether Arbeloa shows up at Valdebebas at 6 a.m. or Gonzalo at 7, and people celebrate it like we\u2019ve actually won something? \n\nWhen did we get so obsessed with this stuff? They\u2019re just doing their job and getting paid millions for it. We also live in a time where everything has to be said and shown on social media, so of course they use it to generate a positive image around them, which is smart, but at the end of the day what matters is what happens on the pitch.\n\nI\u2019m from Madrid and I\u2019ve been a madridista since I was born, and it really feels like things are getting out of hand and we\u2019re losing focus on what is truly important for this club. They need to remember that \u201cNo player is as good as all of you together.\u201d That sentence is literally in the Bernab\u00e9u tunnel for a reason.\n\nI always think back to when this wasn\u2019t a thing and players were just professional without needing attention for it. Like the story Adebayor told about his first days at Real Madrid: he said he was told training started at 10:30, so he decided to arrive very early to look professional, turning up around 8:30\u20138:45 thinking he would be the first one there, but when he went into the dressing room it was dark and he heard noise downstairs, and a staff member told him Cristiano Ronaldo had already been there since about 7:30, swimming and working. He realised he had tried to be the first, but Cristiano was already there, which showed just how extreme Cristiano\u2019s professionalism and work ethic were, without anyone needing to leak it to the press or turn it into a daily headline.\n\nThat being said let\u2019s hope the situation gets better and certain players understand that they are not above the club, not even close.
