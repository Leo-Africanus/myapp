In the uk this is not acceptable I know but I\u2019ve heard in Spain it is ?\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t be in all red and screaming but will more than likely be noticeable arsenal fans if anyone could shine light on this I would greatly appreciate it as I wouldn\u2019t like to upset anybody or ruin a trip for ourselves. \n\nBest of luck in the game \nThanks",

However some sources say that the only planned signing for Summer is Trent. \n\nIn the past two days however, the situation changed. Somehow Huijsen's callup and interviews lead to madrid interest (Even confirmed by Fabrizio Romano). Huijsen being the centre of attention this entire season does mean a lot of clubs are going to be interested, and if a Yoro situation arises, who else would you like to see?\n\nPersonally the only option I see here is Huijsen. Relatively cheap release clause, Spanish, been flirting with Real and has been seen with Asencio in the Spanish camp too. Real also offered him a contract 3 years ago to join the academy, however he refused. ",

But no old Ronaldo. Even tho you can make case that he is our legend, he played most of the games for us.\n\nBut when you thing about it (I saw someone, somewhere wrote), he played 2 years for PSV, one for Barca, 5 for Inter out of those 2 he was injured, for us he play also 5 (or 4,5 not sure) even tho out of his prime he played for us most. \n\nBecause he played for both Real-Barca, Inter-AcMilan non take him as legend as that. But he is definitely legend of Brazil &amp; legend of Football. (As that guy wrote I mention up there).\n\nSo what you all think about this?",

I would go with a 8/10 as he had some amazing moments like hattrick vs City and a really good game vs Barcelona in Super Cup. He has scored some stunning goals, but I still think we need A LITTLE BIT more from him, which I know he will provide.
