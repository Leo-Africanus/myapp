But he still had a lot of potential and to some extent has proven that he is a top talent.\n\nHonorable Mentions: Gareth Bale and Isco. I didn\u2019t include them because they contributed and have their own legacies but they had potential for even more.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Any players that come to mind?",

Now, successful academy players means nothing if we don't win anything though lmao so we'll see. Also I didn't include Joan Martinez because he's still recovering from the ACL so I doubt he'll be with the first team that much this season",

        "content": "With the news about the club wanting to loan him to sociedad ( from a tier 1 source I believe) I think it's clear that they prefer Gonzalo over him which means he might not get a lot of minutes this season which would lead to him stagnating whereas he should be playing moreto refine himself. Also considering the scenario in which rodrygo stays that means endrick could possibly get less minutes than last season since we might be playing with 2 attackers. It's really sad to see honestly because endrick is better than gonzalo (except for aerial ability) and has the potential to be insane, he literally saved us in the copa del rey and had 5 goals in 5 games",
