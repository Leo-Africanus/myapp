He still makes things happen. Whether it\u2019s beating a defender and sending a cross in, shots on target, hell, even a G/A. He makes things happen and his presence is always felt.\n\nTo put things in perspective, Mbapp\u00e9, in his DEBUT season, is only 10 goals away from equaling Rodrygo\u2019s total LaLiga goal count. That is just crazy to me. I\u2019d like to know everyone\u2019s thoughts here. Am I rushing to conclusions and being reactionary? Or is this truly a player that is just not at the level of a  Real Madrid starter?",

        "content": "This isn't a post defending Rodrygo. I'm just bringing up his case as a perfect example of how lot of fans dramatically change their mind within the span of few weeks, sometimes just one week.\n\nRight after we lost the against Arsenal in El Bernabeu, Marca asked people to  \nvote which players should leave this summer. I'll paste here the most relevant part and I'll provide the link for those who want to read it:\n\n\\&gt;The question was simple, but forceful (Which players should leave in the summer?)... and the answer couldn't have been more direct  \n\\[.......\\]  \n**&gt;Jes\u00fas Vallejo** received 12% of the votes \\[...\\] He narrowly surpassed (11%) **Lucas V\u00e1zquez**, \\[...\\] The list of culprits is long and sharp. **Alaba followed closely (10%), then Ancelotti and Mendy (9%)... before surprisingly reaching Vinicius (63,000 votes).**  \n\\[.......\\]  \n**&gt;As things stand, Courtois gets the best grade of all (7.16) and Vallejo the worst (3.19). In total, 14 players passed (Courtois, Valverde, Asensio, Bellingham, R\u00fcdiger, Brahim, Ceballos, Lunin, Modric, Mbapp\u00e9, Carvajal, Endrick, Rodrygo, and Camavinga) and 10 failed (the rest of the squad and Ancelotti).**\n\n  \nLink: [https://www.marca.com/futbol/real-madrid/2025/04/18/aficion-mira-palco-exige-dos-fichajes-venderia-vinicius-verano.html](https://www.marca.com/futbol/real-madrid/2025/04/18/aficion-mira-palco-exige-dos-fichajes-venderia-vinicius-verano.html)\n\nThat was only 1 week ago. The votes were pretty much in line with what many people was saying on this sub after that game.\n\nThose with good memory should remember how for most part of the season how many people used to name Tchouameni as a player who should be sold, and Vinicius (best of the world last season according to most fans) was very often mentioned as a player an attacker that should be sold.\n\nRodrygo or Mbappe were barely mentioned if someone asked if any of our attackers should leave.\n\nFast forward two weeks and nobody thinks Tchouameni should leave, almost nobody mentions Viniciuys should leave but lot of people think Rodrygo should.\n\nNow some will claim that they never asked for Vinicius to be sold but they always asked Rodrygo to be sold. Well, maybe you in particular didn't but the facts are there. If are one of those who claims this or the other certified great player should be sold then I don't believe you, and if you think Rodrygo isn't a great player (despite his performance this season) then I'm sorry but I gotta laugh at how little you understand this team sport.",

A few years ago, we were losing 4-0 to Barcelona and getting knocked out by teams like Ajax. Yet even then, at our lowest, we found a way to rebuild and come back stronger. Even at our worst, we won trophies because we adapted and evolved.\n\nThere\u2019s no point in commenting on other teams; what matters is that we, collectively, need to evolve again. Football has changed. Players today are so used to individual attention that they struggle to share the spotlight. But remember when we had Ronaldo, no one could have imagined anyone else from our team winning a Ballon d\u2019Or. Yet we produced not just one, but two different Ballon d\u2019Or winners after him. It\u2019s not about individual awards they never mattered much to me it\u2019s about what they represented: the strength of the team. Our trophy cabinet didn\u2019t grow because of individual brilliance alone; it grew because we played for each other.\n\nFootball has evolved, and the people who need to understand that the most are the ones managing the club the board and the decision makers.\n\nThe part that hurts the most when I watch our matches today is this, the soul of the team I once supported feels lost. There\u2019s no passion, no mentality just wannabe Instagram stars and crybabies. Players lose the ball and stay down waiting for a foul instead of fighting to win it back. That\u2019s not the Real Madrid way.\n\nWe need leadership someone who can bring these kids back in line, or, frankly, some people need to leave.\n\nRegardless, I\u2019ll always support the badge. But this? This is not the level, nor the spirit, of Real Madrid.\n\nWe will bounce back, that\u2019s for sure. \n\nHala Madrid!! ",
