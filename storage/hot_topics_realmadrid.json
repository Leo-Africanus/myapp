        "content": "I don't want to sound like a broken record, so I will start with leaving the link to the post that made many people react like I was insulting their mothers.\n\n[The sooner Real Madrid sign Alphonso Davies, the better. Mendy's shortcomings are limiting the team. : r/realmadrid](https://www.reddit.com/r/realmadrid/comments/1ewysu1/the_sooner_real_madrid_sign_alphonso_davies_the/)\n\n5 months have passed since that controversial\u00a0take.\n\n**Against Valencia, Camavinga came on in the 68th minute, and did more in attack than Mendy since the start of the season.** His first touch in the game, a simple give and go and a Valencia player gets a yellow card. Next, focus on the first goal scored by Modric. It would've been impossible with Mendy on the pitch. We all know that the Frenchman would've passed the ball backwards.\n\nLet's hope that Mendy gets back in form, because he's been terrible this season (not only in attack). Real Madrid should start the 2025/2026 campaign with a new starting leftback. Davies would be perfect. If it can't be done just sign anybody who is \"loved by the ball.\" This team is crying out for it.\n\nWhile I'm at it, I have to bring up the rightback position. **Lucas V\u00e1zquez\u00a0has been thrown under the bus by the club and the manager.** It's not his fault. He gives his all as always, but his legs are just gone. If Ancelotti wants to win the CL this year, he has to put Valverde there. It weakens the midfield, but he has no alternative. Maybe Asencio but it's a huge risk to play an inexperienced, young kid out of position against the best teams.\n\n**As for Arnold**, I'm completely indifferent. He's a very good player with some world-class attributes but a terrible defender. I watched Liverpool vs United yesterday. An average footballer like Dalot could go past him with ease. Just another confirmation (like anybody would need more). Clumsy, slow, lazy, just a bull in a china shop when it comes to defending. Still, for free I would take him. Just warn Valverde. The poor guy thought that once Kroos and Modric retire he wouldn't have to run for the others anymore (at least not for defenders).\n\nIt's a shame that **Reece James'** career is being destroyed by injuries. He would be a perfect Carvajal's replacement. A similar style of play with no significant weaknesses. Very good at attacking and defending. He was linked with Madrid a couple of years ago, and Vinicius has praised him several times. I bet that he was the number 1 in Calafat's notebook. Real shame.\n\n**Whoever comes, he will be under scrutiny like no other rightback in Real Madrid's history.** He will have to replace the best rightback in the club's history, the best Spanish rightback in history and the best rightback in the Champions League's history (at least in the modern era). That's\u00a0a\u00a0hell\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0task.\n\nThe fullbacks are Madrid's **Achilles heel** this season. Basically, with the ball (Mendy) and without it (Vazquez or Fran) the team play with 10 men.",

Since this is at the end of our trip, I dont know if I'll have enough money left to buy tickets for all 3 of us, so he will probably he going alone.  \nAlso, I got him the Madridista card as you suggested, thank you for that idea! Is this match a very popular one or is it sort of safe to assume I'll be able to get a ticket if I keep checking the site?  \nThanks!
