He used to be this extremely passionate workhorse but we dont see that nowadays either. He plays like he's tired. Keep in mind this is the captain of real madrid we're talking about here. You wouldnt ever notice that he's the captain if it werent for his armband. This sub is going crazy about Jude and Arda but in reality Fede is the one who's been severly underperforming. Camavinga 100% deserves the starting spot over him. Hope he gets back to his best...",

And our 8, the English model who doesn\u2019t want to play 8 and makes a mess because he wants to play 10 and park at the front to score tap-ins and celebrate, but to play as a proper 8 and be useful for the team ? No it won\u2019t happen.\n And the big two stars Vini and Kylian who only want their personal benefit, not the team. The poor press they don\u2019t even do it.\nVini , who made the disrespectful action in the classico who loses the ball a million times in every match and become a winger can\u2019t get even agianst any Right back in 1v1 except some matches and we saw it and makes stupid decisions most of the matches this season,man even Bradley put him in his pocket \nAnd Kylian, who wants princess treatment. he won\u2019t press like the rest of the team; he doesn\u2019t want to tire himself every match. He just scores goals and celebrates, that\u2019s all.\n\nXabi obviously have faults but will it be Every time the coach faults? So Carlo was first now Xabi, Every time we will do the same mistake and blame the Coach and forget about the Ridiculous players ?",

He was never a perfect player, but his nonstop energy, vertical runs, and aggressive work rate on the right side gave the team a crucial extra dimension. With him, opponents had to respect that flank, stretching defenses and creating space for Vini and Mbapp\u00e9 to exploit. Without him, the entire right wing has gone dead, letting teams overload the left and simply lock onto our two superstars. The attack becomes predictable, the buildup stalls, and Madrid loses the balance and unpredictability that Franco\u2019s presence naturally provided.",

        "title": "Our midfield is too unbalanced and lacks technical ability",
        "content": "I've said something similar after the Olympiacos win and every single game the problem becomes more and more evident. We have too many midfielders with the exact same similar weaknesses: creativity from the back, passing and technical ability in general. We have too many \"physical\" midfielders, who aren't that amazing with the ball on their feet.\n\nThe weirdest part is that this team has been so used on playing with the best technical midfielders in the world: Kroos, Modric, Isco and before them, Ozil and Xabi himself. Nowadays apart from Arda, who's also struggling when sharing the pitch with Bellingham and he's getting pushed wider, none of our other (starting) midfielders can distribute the ball well, especially from the back. \n\nAgainst both Olympiacos and Girona we saw the same thing. Tchouameni receives the ball from the defenders, takes 5 touches and... 3 business days to do anything and once he's tighty marked, he does a simple sidepass that leads to more sidepasses, nothing or losing possession. Jude and Fede are nowhere to be found on these situations, so nobody can really collect the ball deep and start an attacking sequence. In the past, Casemiro also wasn't the best ball playing guy ever, but he was surrounded by two of the best passers ever. Now, nobody has these abilities. Camavinga was decent on both halves he played in the recent week defensively, although with the ball on his feet he has the exact same problems.\n\nWe basically need desperately a deep lying playmaker. Can Nico Paz play that role effectively? I'm not sure. Is there anyone else available on the market who is on RM level and won't cost a fortune? Again, not really sure. But until we get someone, even an inconsistent Ceballos might be very useful into balancing out this team. We also have to look into the Fede situation. The guy hasn't had a good performance in a while now.",

Currently we are playing like some mid-table team, which is crazy for club like this. \n\nIt really looks that Xabi wants to make an impact and to help but that is not happening. Are the players angry, are they unmotivated? Looks like ego is the big part of some players who think they are untouchable and that they should play no matter how good or bad they are. Every player should learn that he is not bigger than coach or a club. Also, do these players ever watch their games and how they play? Looks like after every game they are like 'it is not what we wanted but we need to stay strong and keep going'  and that's it, somebody clicks restart button and they forget everything tomorrow morning. I see Valverde unmotivated on the pitch second game in a row, and can't understand what happened. Now you will see, next game against Athletic everything will be repeated as it was yesterday. \n\nWe need to go on a market not afraid to spend money. In previous years it looked like we don't have any money cause we always wanted someone free or cheap not willing to make a move for someone big and good. Don't get me wrong, player don't have to be famous, just to be good. \n\nAt the end I want to repeat what someone wrote, we sacked Ancelotti for the same thing that is happening to us now. Problem is much more deeper than we thought. \n",

        "content": "I can't do nothing else but laugh at our current situation, cause Perez despite being the most successful club president of the modern era sure is stubborn as fuck and loves to repeat the same mistake over and over.\n\nNow i understand, no one is above the club, bla bla, but ffs how can we be so dense when it comes to committing to managers who actually put food on our table. That's twice in the last 10 years we fall into the same bullshit predicament, all because was thinking about his marketing projects over proper team building.\n\n2014 we get a manager who wins us our first CL since 2002, the elusive Decima, because he goes the next season, things go sideways, we sack him. Bring another wannabe tactician, who could not last 6 months. Then Zidane took the reigns, the rest is history. Not 1, not 2, but 3 CLs back-fucking-back. No team has ever defended the title in the modern CL format and Zidane managed to 3 peat. Instead of giving the man a blank cheque and help him build a dynasty with a already winning team, we let him go because Perez always wants to be man in charge. \n\nThe we bring another wanna boring tactician, he gets sacked in 6 months as well, and where come Zidane 2.0 to save Perez' ass again. 2 seasons later, instead of reinforcing the team for him, we send media hit pieces to shit on him all year to the point of him quitting. Then there comes Carlo, again out of love for the club, and lord and behold he wins the CL+League the same year. Does it again two seasons later. Here comes yet another opportunity where we have a serial winner of a manager, we could just build a damn project around his already winning team and the players willing to dies for the him. But no, we leave him out to dry, no defensive reinforcements, or any at all then he gets all the blame in the end.\n\nNow the cycle repeats, we bring yet another wannabe tactician with zero pedigree who already seem to have lost the locker room. Except, this time, neither Zidane nor Carlo will come save Perez' ass. \n\nAll we needed to do after the 23/24 season, is ask Ancelotti what he needed to keep the team winning, he probably would've asked for a true #9, 3-4 defenders and a Kroos-type player. But Perez, marketing first, Mbappe it is even if he was not needed. And then Alonso cause he's the hot new toy. \n\nWe fucking did this to ourselves. All i was hearing last season was how Xabi would revolutionize this team, how the academy players would get chances, how we would play tactical pressing football under modern ideas ... I guess subbing out Trent for Gonzalo is part of those modern ideas.",

All we can do is hope and pray for better days to come. Again getting too emotional and harsh on our own players and club wouldn't be doing anyone any favors. Let's stay calm positive and just support our club like we do. Our job is not to look for solutions or to make the club do exactly what we want. \nTrust The Process ",

        "content": "A Bar\u00e7a fan coming in peace asking a question for Madrid fans\n\nI was watching the last match vs Alav\u00e9s and noticed something about Flick. Even after winning, he looked kind of sad or distant on the bench. I\u2019ve also seen similar moments with Xabi Alonso rarely smiling, always looking tense.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m overthinking it, but it really made me realise how insanely difficult it must be to manage clubs like Real Madrid and Barcelona. The pressure is constant. Even Pep left Bar\u00e7a after so much success, and Zidane walked away after the three-peat. There are many other examples too.\n\nSo my question to Madrid fans:\nDo you also feel that managing these clubs drains coaches emotionally, even when the results are good?\nWould love to hear your thoughts.",
