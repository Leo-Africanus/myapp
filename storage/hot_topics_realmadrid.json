        "title": "2 Different Ballon Dor Propping.....2024 Pt.2??",
        "content": "Ok, so recently I've seen a bunch of tweets pushing Fede for the ballon dor which I'm all for tbh, I think he deserves it because like Rodri he is out most important player. However, earlier I saw post talking about Mbappe prop for the ballon dor. Now, this caught my attention because it reminded of last season. Last season Jude was on top of ballon dor shouts until the fanbase decided to jump onto Vini halfway. This ruined Jude's charge because the fanbase was split in part, so was the voting, and in the end a third party (Rodri) came through with full support. Now, this season unlike last season we don't have THE favorite, but we do have a favorite in Mbappe.\n\nNow, last season I was apart of the Vini train just because Vini is very sentimental to me because I got into the sport and became a madrid fan when he was just a meme (2019). So, seeing the fact I could watch him develop and now win a ballon dor just took me over. Now, this season Fede is also sentimental to me, but I don't want to make the same mistake. Would I want a Fede Dor, yes more than anything, but I don't wanna see the same mistake be made. I know twitter isn't everything, but majority of where PR goes on is Twitter and i guess Insta but I don't use Insta. \n\n In all honestly I believe we should stick to Mbappe, because he is basically our only player who has the media and the peoples backing. Valverde is one of the most underrated players itw, so that alone is hard to push him. But if we manage to push him, we don't have that Barcelona PR (Saying this legitimately, no troll, no immaturity, but it is evident) where we can support both players and still get them up there. We either focus on one, or the other, and my pick is Mbappe as he is the one with the best chance for us this season.\n\nI just wanted to see others opinions on this. I barely have any followers on Twitter so I took to here because otherwise I'd be talking to nobody lol. Thoughts, Feedback, Opinions?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/425tv9o1wcpe1.png?width=946&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ffcd6fcbfe36686121ab535525b2cab94559441\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ydyxt9o1wcpe1.png?width=952&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=744085cc2c22b1053f26d9f6ed5c27d07bc96a37\n\n",

        "title": "Lucas Vazquez, the fullback that really isn't. Is the criticism actually fair?",
        "content": "I've been wanting to hear opinion about Lucas that isn't a kneejerk reaction that comes off the back of a poor performance or a missed penalty (imagine the angry mob if we didn't make it past Atleti lol)\n\nMy case for Lucas\n\nFootballers aren't Swiss Army knives, not all of them anyways. Certainly not Lucas.  \nHe's our backup RB because once upon a time Carvajal was out injured and at the time we didn't have a backup RB (for the record, we still don't) so he was asked (or volunteered) to perform a role that isn't actually his. He did an okay/decent job back then, and sure some of us joke around calling him Lord Vazquez and Cafucas, but those names came from somewhere. In my mind, that can be considered some form of evidence that he performed well at some point.\n\nFast forward to today and his performances at RB have clearly taken a dip. That is undeniable. However, every time I see people calling for his head every game. None of this is on Lucas, it's on management. Every player that's played at RB over the last x number of seasons that is not named Dani Carvajal has *not* been an actual fullback; Lucas (not a fullback), Nacho (a versatile defender), Valverde (can do the job but is not a fullback), Asencio (versatile defender and really got a shot because of poor planning), Militao (CB).\n\nWhy is context thrown away every time his name comes up lately? You have a guy who is really one of the few options we have performing a role that isn't really his.  \nAgain, I'm not excusing his performances, they have been shaky at best. However he is a winger in a fullback costume and I judge him that way. The same way I would judge Rodrygo, for example, if he were playing at fullback.\n\nWhat am I missing here? Is the criticism *fair*? What are your thoughts?",

I understand his playing time has been limited, but even in instances where he plays -apart from that one CDR game- he seems lost. The squad being unorganized this season has not helped at all.",

        "content": "I don't watch Castilla's matches, but I like to watch some highlights and videos to have a closer look at our gems. And honestly, Manuel Angel is the player that got my attention more than anyone else.\n\nHis playing style is kinda similar to Pedri.. his technique, vision, passes, dribbling skills.. very impressive.\n\nBut I know watching highlights isn't enough to judge a player. So if anyone here is watching RM Castilla, how good is Manuel Angel? I know he missed many matches this season due to injuries. Is he good enough to get promoted to the first team? ",
