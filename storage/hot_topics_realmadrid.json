Anyone who saw Prime Ronaldo at the absolute peak of his power give a decade of his prime to this club would be absolutely embarrassed to downplay his impact at this club.\n\nIt's like these people are annoyed when Ronaldo is mentioned. Sorry, this is not your house, it's his and will always be, he came when it was in shambles, restored it to its past glory and left, deal with it.\n\nAnytime Ronaldo mentions Madrid on his socials or Real Madrid mentions him they get irked, as if the club and it's greatest player interacting with eachother is something weird. and it's embarrassing to watch.",

Do you think this game was more about his individual mistakes or a wider defensive collapse?

He cuts inside and tries to find an opening for a shot, but it gets blocked. Roberto Mart\u00edn receives the rebound and shoots from a tight angle, the keeper saves it, but the ball gets a weird rotation and flies over him and into the goal, with Barroso avoiding to touch it and steal his teammates goal\n\n43' - Liberto moves past two defenders with a single move, but his strong finish from a tight angle is saved\n\nHT - an expectedly dominant first half from Julian L\u00f3pez de Lerma's team, who created a big amount of chances and managed to convert the amount of them necessary to finish off this match already - at the other end, Voloshyn saved the penalty to prevent a blemish on the first half's performance and score\n\n\ud83d\udd04 46' - second half underway, Gasc\u00f3n has come on for Beto\n\n47' - indirect free kick for Kairat in the box after Voloshyn apparently picked up a back pass - the back pass was deflected and headed on by the Kairat player though, big error from the referee\n\n48' - Kairat's Tuyakbayev, after his penalty miss, now also steps up for the indirect free kick - he skies it spectacularly despite the short distance. Not his day, that's for sure\n\n\ud83d\udd04 56' - the center backs bet swapped out - Ariel and Lezcano come on for Galassi and Rivas\n\n\u26bd 58' - Goal for Kairat out of nowhere, huge error by Voloshyn, who drops the ball after a harmless cross, and Bekbolat can tap it in\n\n\ud83d\udd04 62' - Jacobo comes on for Barroso\n\n\u26bd 77' - GOLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - Pol Dur\u00e1n plays in Jacobo, who fakes a shot, putting the defender on the ground, and then calmly finishes past the keeper to restore the 3-goal lead\n\n\ud83d\udd04 79' - last sub, Bail\u00f3n for Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez \n\n90'+5 - penalty for Juvenil A from a corner that would've been the last kick of the game - it was a clear handball by the Kairat player\n\n90'+6 - Jacobo steps up, and takes identical penalty as the Kairat player earlier, no force, no placement and no confidence and the keeper can easily save it\n\nFT - a much worse second half with lapses of concentration in both defense and attack is still enough to take the 3-goal lead home to Madrid against an expectedly weak Kairat side. Juli\u00e1n L\u00f3pez de Lerma's team did their job sufficiently in the first half and is first in the league table for now with 6/6 points and a 7:3 goal difference, however having just played the very first fixture of his matchday\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 9:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Stad\u00efon Akadem\u00ef\u00ef T.S.

Completely focused on the task at hand and focused on making the comeback. Fast foward 2 years later, when we are struggling and things aren't going our way, what do we do ? The leaders of the dressing room tries to hide and hang their heads rather than leading the team and motivating them to make a comeback.",

        "title": "Benzema - On how he kept the squad balanced",
        "content": "Benzema only started to play when Gonzalo Higua\u00edn got injured. At the time, Mourinho wasn't considering Benzema a decent striker, calling Benzema a cat and saying that he preferred to hunt with dogs, not cats, and he had no choice. \n\nBenzema ended up being the second-highest goal scorer for Real Madrid with 354 goals, behind Ronaldo's 450 goals. And the numbers say that if he had taken the penalties that Ronaldo scored, he would've been the top scorer. However, Benzema wasn't as big as the CR7 Brand, which is why he couldn't take penalties. In the 2019-2020 season, if Benzema had taken the 11 La Liga penalties, he would've won the Pechichi, but Ramos was the first choice after Ronaldo left. And that's also why the squad didn't crumble. Benzema's disposition made him not chase stardom or seek the spotlight. \n\nOn the other hand, Perez preferred Benzema over Ronaldo, criticizing Ronaldo on multiple occasions, calling Ronaldo an \"Imbecile\" and Mourinho \"Abnormal.\" Of course, it would be natural to say that he would have preferred Benzema to take the penalties, but the CR7 halo effect was stronger, and the team needed Ronaldo to compete with Messi's Barcelona. \n\nBenzema settled as the second man; he assisted 14% of Ronaldo's goals, helping Ronaldo shine more, which solved the huge problem of having more than one star on the team. he had the confidence within him to become the shadow of Ronaldo. That's exactly what Zidane did during the Galacticos, when he played deeper, not to compete with the others on scoring. \n\n  \nWe can confidently say that Karim Benzema was the true hero working in the shadows. We need a Karim Benzema-like behavior. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y46opzqi84sf1.jpg?width=736&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62f19b459b929c4b2337a2df4ae8e42f86648da0\n\n",

        "content": "We dont have the players to play 4-3-3. Mbappe is not a traditional number 9. Carreras and Vini are often hugging the same space with Vini rarely linking up with Carreras or crashing the CF spot in the box like how CR7 did when Marcelo would make his daunting forward runs. Bellingham is almost always too far from Tchou and Fede. Tchou and Fede dont compliment each other as CM and DMs should do. Arda is not a traditional winger and if he leaves his RW spot to playmake or smooth out the possession distribution, the whole Right side structure collapses.\n\nI dont think this 4-3-3 is made for Real Madrid with the current profile of players we have.\n\nWhen we played against PSG in the CWC, the inclusion of Mbappe forced us into 4-3-3 with Gonzalo Garcia pseudo RW and the gaping holes were again there for them to exploit. In my opinion the distance between our three midfielders is almost always comical whenever we play from the back against a high pressing opponents.",

I saw some people talking about benching or maybe even selling players like fede and jude and rodrygo. Jude came back from injury, yeah it was a bad decision for him to start, but we know the quality he brings to the team, he's a maestro on the ball, let's just give him some time to get adjusted again, and fede?? Holy, criticism is completely fair but this sub is filled with reactionary fans, what would happen to you if you supported your local team where they barely win anything.   \nI swear I'll lose my mind if I see another post on why some player should be benched or sold or that he's shit or doesn't fit the system, from what we know of xabi, he's not reluctant to change the system, he'll adapt with the players he has, you just gotta trust in him",

        "content": "It still  hurts. The biggest reason for the defeat was predictability. Xabi himself said a few days ago that we need to be less predictable, but when it came to the match nothing really changed.\n\nAt Leverkusen, one thing I loved about him was how balanced the attack was. Around 33% down the left and through the center and  on the right. Here with us it\u2019s always the same pattern everything goes through the left, we were successful in previous matches when doing this but we can leave the center empty, and the right side barely exists. Opponents know exactly what\u2019s coming.\n\nIn previous matches, when Mastantuono was starting, we actually had some balance because the kid gave us a real threat on the right. But taking that option away made us repeat the same mistake from last season. Rushing Bellingham back and sacrificing the RW just made things worse and honestly felt like a rookie mistake.\n\nThen came the bad luck too. No Trent, and Carvajal\u2019s injury took away the last bit of threat we had on the right. With both out, we were way too one-dimensional.\n\nIt's good this happened this early, We\u2019ll bounce back. Xabi learns fast, and he will fix these mistakes.\n\nHala Madrid.",
