        "content": "I can\u2019t believe that the player because of whom I started watching football and supporting Real Madrid is leaving. It doesn\u2019t feel real. Luka wasn\u2019t just another footballer to me, he was the reason I fell in love with the game\n\nFor me,Lukita isn\u2019t just the best midfielder of his generation, he\u2019s my favorite footballer of all time. Nobody comes close. The way he saw the game, the way he controlled tempo, the way he made the impossible look effortless. You couldn\u2019t teach what he had. It was pure instinct, pure magic\n\nI\u2019ll never forget that goal against Manchester United in the 2013 champions league RO 16,  Or his long-range strike vs Granada in 2014, when people were still doubting his impact. The trivela assist to Rodrygo vs Chelsea in 2022 still doesn\u2019t feel real. At 36 years old, delivering that in a Champions League quarterfinal with Madrid on the ropes, only luka\n\nThere was that perfect Champions League final in 2018 against Liverpool, where he quietly ran the whole show. And who can forget the 2016 Clasico at Camp Nou when he bossed the midfield and silenced 90,000 with his poise? That was Modric  never loud, always in control\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the big games. It was the moments in between. The press resistance, the turns in tight spaces, the one touch passes that opened up entire defenses. That little skip he does before passing. The way he pressed like he was 28, even when he was 37. He never stopped giving everything.\n\nI grew up with him. I learned football watching him. Thank you, Luka, for every beautiful moment. For the elegance, the fight, the loyalty. You were the soul of this team. No one will ever wear the number 10 like you did.\n\nYou\u2019ll always be a legend.\n\nHala Madrid y nada m\u00e1s",

The moment I never wanted to come, but that\u2019s football as in life everything has a beginning and an end... on Saturday I will play my last match at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u\u201d.  \n  \n\u201cI arrived in 2012 with the desire to wear the shirt of the best team in the world and with the ambition to do big things, but I couldn\u2019t imagine what came next\u201d.  \n  \n\u201cPlaying at Real Madrid changed my life as a soccer player and as a person. It\u2019s been something magic\u201d.  \n  \n\u201cI feel so proud to have been part of one of the most successful eras of the best club in history, Madrid\u201d.  \n  \n\u201cI want to thank the club from the bottom of my heart, especially president Florentino Perez, my teammates, coaches, all the people who have helped me here\u201d.  \n  \n\u201cThroughout these years I\u2019ve experienced incredible moments, comebacks that seemed impossible, finals, celebrations and magical nights at the Bernab\u00e9u... We won everything, I was very happy. Very, very happy\u201d.  \n  \n\u201cBut beyond the titles and victories, I carry in my heart the affection of all Madrid fans. I really don\u2019t know how to explain the special connection I have with you and how supported, respected, loved I have felt and feel\u201d.  \n  \n\u201cI will never forget each ovation, all the gestures of affection you have shown me during the years\u201d.  \n  \n\u201cLeaving with a full heart. Filled with pride, gratitude and unforgettable memories. And even though, after the Club World Cup, I\u2019m no longer going to wear this shirt on the field, I\u2019ll always be a Madrid fan\u201d.  \n  \n\u201cHala Madrid y nada m\u00e1s!\u201d.",

        "content": "\"Dear Madridistas,\n\nThe moment has come. The moment I never wanted to arrive, but that\u2019s football, and in life everything has a beginning and an end\u2026 On Saturday, I will play my last match at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u.\n\nI arrived in 2012 with the dream of wearing the shirt of the best club in the world and the ambition to achieve great things, but I could never have imagined what came next.\n\nPlaying for Real Madrid changed my life\u2014both as a footballer and as a person.\n\nI am proud to have been part of one of the most successful eras in the history of the greatest club.\n\nI want to sincerely thank the club\u2014especially president Florentino P\u00e9rez\u2014my teammates, coaches, and everyone who has supported me throughout all these years.\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve experienced incredible moments\u2014comebacks that seemed impossible, finals, celebrations, and magical nights at the Bernab\u00e9u\u2026 We\u2019ve won everything, and I\u2019ve been very happy. Very, very happy.\n\nBut beyond the trophies and victories, what I carry in my heart is the love of all the Madridistas. Truly, I don\u2019t know how to explain the special connection I have with you and how supported, respected, and loved I\u2019ve felt\u2014and still feel.\n\nI will never forget each ovation and every gesture of affection you\u2019ve shown me.\n\nI leave with my heart full. Full of pride, gratitude, and unforgettable memories. And although, after the Club World Cup, I will no longer wear this shirt on the pitch, I will always be a Madridista.\n\nWe will meet again. Real Madrid will always be my home. For life.\n\nHala Madrid y Nada M\u00e1s.\nLuka Modri\u0107.\"",

        "content": "We simply have to give him one more year, he said numerous times his dream is to retire here and I think he plans to after the World Cup anyway so I don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t fulfil the dream of one of our biggest legends. It\u2019s not like he demands to play every minute, I honestly believe he is even willing to play for free for this club. He is a leader in the dressing room, everyone looks up to him and now with Vazquez leaving who is also a big voice in the dressing room we can\u2019t let another veteran leave. We need Luka in this dressing room, he is irreplaceable. The guy literally just played 90 minutes away to Sevilla and was one of our best players. I am simply not ready for a farewell in 2 days, this is not how his story should end.",
