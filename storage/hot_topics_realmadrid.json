Besides the rare misjudgement, Asencio hasn\u2019t missed a beat as the heart of our defence and I see absolutely no reason that he shouldn\u2019t be a staple/starter going forward. \n\nSergio Ramos is the reason I started following this team. Now having the opportunity to see a new defensive player with that same kind of on-field attitude and technical/physical presence feels like a gift. \n\nStepped into a squad that isn\u2019t generally kind to academy players (in terms of their longevity and usually justified based on the quality of player we sign) and he\u2019s hit every performance metric and looks so comfortable doing it. The fact that he successfully slide tackles multiple times a game alone is enough for my vote. Give him the #4. ",
