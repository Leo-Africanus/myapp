        "content": "We can see other tactical coaches like Pep and Jose are very tough, even if they would get sacked they don't step back.\n\nWe did everything well until Vini's outburst, what punishment did he get? Nothing! He got away free, since then the team started to lose discipline. We also see Mastantuono can bring balance, Xabi knew it and was keep using him, but he also got little time after injury.\n\nAnd remember the ATM 2-5 loss, or even the PSG loss? It all got to do with insert a star player who had just recovered into the formation and caused disaster.\n\nXabi's problem was not being too tough, but too nice when you can't step back. If you do you will be pushed to the abyss in a matter of time. This has happened many times before in RM and other teams. I still feel bad for him and  think sacking him was not the right time. And I want to correct the misinfo of \"RM never need such coach\". Both Jose and Capello are very important in our recent great era.",
