        "content": "I guess we'll find him dragging the defenders to his nearest ball holding teammate instead of making runs and creating chances, effectively limiting his options to do anything.\n\nOr worse, like this case, complain about a perfect chance not being turned into a back pass for him to dribble into a defender and lose the ball \n\nI repeat he may be a great goal scorer but thats all he has to offer and it's simply not enough, he isn't fit for this team Ancelotti knew it and that's why he asked for a true 9 in Kane. \n\nI mean, why does he offer that we didn't have before? Goals? We had Joselu ona fraction of everything Mbappe has and still delivered those regularly. \n\nCreating chances? Lol, lmfao even. \nBut anyway, we had Vini and Rodrygo handing those out like hot cakes. \n\nHis first touch is mediocre, his deibbling atrocious, his passing mediocre, his off the ball movement? Non-existent.\n\nMaybe Benzema raised the bar too high, but I expect the 9 that palys for Real Madrid to be perfect in all the above mentioned aspects. \n\nTwerked for 5 years  befor joining just to drag down the entire team's chemistry  and to do what? Bring 40 goals a season? I'd rather have Joselu and his 20+ goals (mind you, as a sub) and team's perfectly balanced than whatever this is.  Either he improves or hopefully gets sold. \n\nMind you I'm not saying he's the only culprit, but the other get plenty of criticism already, this dude got away for so long with his bs. First season was \"not judge to hastily\"  now for the most part, up until like 3 games ago  the scapegoat was Vinicius.  When will it be enough? \n\nDude ghost the entire game, we play in 10 v 11 for 80 min, the he scores a random goal (possibly a pen earned by someone else hard work, probably the aforementioned Vinicius) and almost everyone forgets he made Casper look like and amateur for the entirety of the match.

        "content": "Full Writeup: **Martin Samuel \u2013 The Times: It's not just Jose Mourinho \u2014 abuse of Vinicius Jr has been enabled at every level | Real Madrid star has been subjected to racism on several occasions in Spain \u2014 Mourinho's reaction to his allegations against Gianluca Prestianni is not the first of its kind** \n\nWhy did Jos\u00e9 Mourinho feel entitled to speak that way about Vin\u00edcius Jr? He was enabled, as others have been before him. Enabled by Uefa, by the Spanish league, by tame local media, by all the figures in authority who, across many years, could have ended this, but did not. It\u2019s not just about Mourinho, it\u2019s about Javier Tebas; it\u2019s not just about Benfica, it\u2019s about Porto, too. What Vin\u00edcius claimed occurred last week at the Est\u00e1dio da Luz has been going on for years; because those with power have allowed it to happen. \n\nIt would be easier to list the grounds in Spain where Vin\u00edcius hasn\u2019t been racially abused, but here are a few where he has: Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Valencia, Albacete, Real Mallorca,\u00a0Real Valladolid, Real Sociedad, Getafe, Osasuna, Real Betis and Sevilla. Since 2021, La Liga has logged 26 different racist incidents involving Vin\u00edcius at 11 distinct stadiums. Sometimes the trouble is brought to his home. In January 2023, a dummy dressed as the player was found hanging from a bridge near Real Madrid\u2019s training ground. Four Atletico fans received suspended prison sentences for this affront, more than two years later. \n\nYet the year Vin\u00edcius was hung in effigy was also the year Tebas, the La Liga president, was forced to apologise for his reaction to the player\u2019s threat to leave the field at the Mestalla, after being subjected to monkey chants by Valencia fans. When Vin\u00edcius said it was a problem he was encountering across Spain, Tebas went on the defensive. \u201cBefore you criticise and insult La Liga, you need to inform yourself well, Vini Jr. Don\u2019t let yourself be manipulated,\u201d he posted on social media, his instinct being to protect the brand. \u201cI think that the message, and the intention I had, was not understood by a significant number,\u201d he later clarified. \u201cIf I hurt someone, if they thought I was racist, it\u2019s far from reality.\u201d \n\nWhat is reality, however, is that Mourinho\u2019s reaction, in which he sought to blame Vin\u00edcius\u2019s goal celebration for what may have been a \u00adracist tirade from one of his Benfica players \u2014 Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 alleges that he heard Gianluca Prestianni use the word \u201cmonkey\u201d towards Vin\u00edcius five times \u2014 is not the first of its kind. In 2022, Pedro Bravo, the president of Spain\u2019s association of football agents, went even further. \u201cYou have to respect your rivals,\u201d he told the television show\u00a0*El Chiringuito*. \u201cIf you want to dance samba, go to a sambodromo in Brazil. Here you have to respect your colleagues, and stop acting like a monkey.\u201d Not a fool, not a clown; a monkey. You know what Freud would say about that dismal serving of word association? Naturally, a clarification followed. \u201cIt always ends with an apology and \u2018I was misinterpreted,\u2019 \u201d Vin\u00edcius commented, ruefully. \n\nYet this isn\u2019t his problem alone. While Vin\u00edcius attracts a disproportionate number of racist incidents compared to other black players, he is not the first to struggle to get his case heard. In March 2024, the Spanish third-tier team Rayo Majadahonda walked off during a game with Sestao River, in protest that their goalkeeper was being racially abused. The Spanish federation punished the accusers, not the abusers, with a 3-0 defeat, a three-point deduction and a \u20ac3,000 fine. Later that year, Christantus Uche, a Nigerian playing for Getafe at the time, gave an interview complaining about racism. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand, he can\u2019t say that,\u201d the Getafe president, \u00c1ngel Torres, said. \u201cWhen he has been here for one or two years and understands Spanish, he can say whatever he wants.\u201d Uche decided not to test this and signed for Crystal Palace. \n\nWind back to 2011-12, the season Manchester City made their first appearance in the modern Champions League. Knocked out at the group stage and dropped to the Europa League, they drew Porto. City were new to this. During the match, their executives thought they heard an ugly sound. It seemed to erupt every time Mario Balotelli or Yaya Tour\u00e9 were on the ball. Fearing inexperience in the European game, and not wishing to offend their hosts, they first checked with the travelling press pack that the noise was what they thought it was. The press, then Balotelli, confirmed it. City complained to Uefa, whose match representatives were uninterested, and their hosts were indeed offended. Porto\u2019s executives behaved as if City were just troublemaking newcomers unused to the big stage. Ultimately, Porto were fined a paltry \u00a316,000 by Uefa. In the next round, City were a minute late back onto the pitch against Sporting Lisbon and fined \u00a324,000. \n\nEuropean football is littered with instances like that. Messengers shot, complainants ridiculed. It was always the English press who were accused of stirring controversy by asking awkward questions after matches. It happened in Bulgaria in 2019. A local cameraman told the England manager Gareth Southgate to f\\*\\*\\* off as he left the room, having fielded questions about racist chanting during a European Championship qualifier. Bulgarian journalists laughed when the subject was raised. Thankfully, there is now a Uefa protocol around racist incidents and at least it was applied last week in Lisbon. But Vin\u00edcius may have to line up against Prestianni again on Wednesday because Uefa investigations move about as fast as law enforcement officers investigating brutalised protesters on the streets of Minneapolis. \n\nAnd media are culpable, too. It was May 2023 when Vin\u00edcius confronted fans at Valencia, accusing them of calling him a monkey. A case went to court in October that year and Vin\u00edcius gave evidence. After misreporting of his words, Valencia insisted he apologised. The local newspaper, Superdeporte, produced a front page with his picture and a long, superimposed, nose. \u201cPINOCHIUS\u201d, read the headline. Soon after the trial, Vin\u00edcius again excelled in a Champions League match against Sporting Braga, all sparkle and step-overs. \u201cIt\u2019s not racism, he deserves a slap for being a clown,\u201d Miquel Camps, a Barcelona board member, posted on social media. \n\nNobody should think tackling racism is easy. Liam Rosenior, Chelsea\u2019s head coach, was asked about the Vin\u00edcius incident and its fallout, and said that any coach or player found guilty of racism \u201cshouldn\u2019t be in the game\u201d. This was interpreted as a call for a life ban on Prestianni if the accusations were proven. Yet proven to what level? In football, a balance of probabilities is often enough to get a guilty verdict. But can, or should, a career be ended on that? John Terry was found guilty of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand this way, but the same case in Westminster magistrates\u2019 court ended in acquittal. Might that happen to Prestianni with need for a greater burden of proof? He covered his mouth with his shirt so couldn\u2019t be lip-read, and Benfica claim Mbapp\u00e9 was too far away to have heard what was said. Uefa may be able to rule given the balance of probability but, if the penalty was a life ban, would surely need to meet more exacting standards. Any hearing could then just deteriorate into he said, she said, with no verdict at the end. The higher the penalty, the more concrete the proof required. \n\nWhat is undeniable, however, is that Vin\u00edcius and others like him have been poorly served. Mourinho spoke as he did because he knew he could; because others had done so before him and got away with it. We may never know what Prestianni uttered beneath the protection of his collar. We can presume, however, that it may hardly be worse than what is often permitted to occur around Vin\u00edcius, very much in plain sight. ",

        "content": "It seems this season has had an uptick in fans trickling in and flooding the sub with very reactionary, and agenda-driven posts. \n\nIt\u2019s normal that with social media and Madrid having some of the most recognizable names on the planet in their squad, the 2023 UCL run would have brought a massive increase in supporters. I\u2019ve seen many of the OP\u2019s here have relatively new accounts or just be younger in general. \n\nI point this out because I think to any fan that\u2019s been following this team a while, you\u2019ll know that this is yet another cycle, during another era, in Madrid history. The story of this club keeps repeating itself because of how it\u2019s run and it\u2019s what\u2019s made it the best sports club to ever exist. \n\nI am not diminishing or gatekeeping any fans\u2019 attachment and loyalty to the club, new or old. I\u2019d just like to put into perspective for some who are new or who have forgotten what this club is and always will be.\n\nThis club will: \n\n\\- Always have the best or most marketable player on the planet, despite having other positional needs.\n\n\\- Go through 10 managers before they question if any stars are the problem. \n\n\\- Always build a squad around talent rather than system. \n\n\\- Never have a manager bigger than its stars. \n\n\\- Never spend money in the winter.\n\n\\- Never prioritize homegrown talent. \n\nThese are the basics that have been true since the 90s. If you are okay with this, then this is the club for you. \n\nAs an aside\u2026I suggest that before a reactionary post is made, you look up the history of the Zidane, R9, Beckham era. A lot of y\u2019all wouldn\u2019t have survived that era. ",
