I really really want to see them and hoping to get an autograph or two on a shirt.\n\nCould anyone please help me out here! There are just too many good hotels to choose from in London and they haven't played arsenal in ages so no reference to use. With the UCL final, they used the grove and with Chelsea, it was one in st James park but that would be far from the Emirates\n\nThanks!",

There's very little online sources for this as well. \n\nI believe him being there for these tough run of games like Arsenal, Barca, etc will be a damn good boost to the team. Anyone with any news?
