        "content": "#FT: JUVENIL A 5:2 OM\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#UEFA YOUTH LEAGUE \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:**\n\n1:0 Thiago Pitarch 17'\n\n1:1 Mohamed Baradji 25'\n\n2:1 Anis Doubal (own goal) 27'\n\n2:2 Tadjidine Mmadi (penalty) 42'\n\n3:2 Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (penalty) 53'\n\n4:2 Diego Mart\u00ednez 'Beto' 80'\n\n5:2 Adri P\u00e9rez 90'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - kickoff, vamos! \n\n\u26bd 17' - GOLLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - Arnu steals the ball from their defensive midfielder, and quickly plays it to Thiago at the edge of the box. He takes a few quick touches to create space, and then cuts his shot across, low into the far corner\n\n\u26bd 25' - goal for OM - Illia punches away a free kick poorly, then their player takes a shot and it hits the post - the ball bounces to Baradji, who takes a little touch, and Joan Mart\u00ednez can't clear it off the line in time (and even then it would've bounced back into the net again), what a crazy and unfortunate goal\n\n\u26bd 27' - GOLLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - and right in the next attack, Fortea advances on the right wing - his powerful and low cross gets deflected into the near corner by Marseille's Doubal! \n\n42' - penalty for OM after a foul by Rivas \n\n\u26bd 42' - Mmadi converts\n\nHT - half time in a very open match where most dangerous situations ended up being goals on both ends - the goals we conceded were entirely avoidable, and the team needs to pay special attention to defending set-pieces better or preventing them from happening in the first place\n\n46' - 2nd half underway \n\n51' - penalty for Juvenil A after Y\u00e1\u00f1ez gets tripped in the box! \n\n\u26bd 53' - GOLLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - Y\u00e1\u00f1ez takes it himself and converts! \n\n\ud83d\udd04 59' - Rivas and Cestero off for Valde and Beto \n\n\ud83d\udd04 71' - Y\u00e1\u00f1ez off for Gabri Valero\n\n\u26bd 80' - GOLLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - golazo de Beto! free kick from around 20 metres out, and Diego Mart\u00ednez strikes it right into the top corner on the goalkeeper's side of the goal! \n\n\ud83d\udd04 83' - last subs, Ciria and Arnu off for Adri P\u00e9rez and Jacobo\n\n\u26bd 90' - GOLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - and the cherry on top, after a dribble by Gabri Valero, he crosses the ball low into the box - it gets deflected towards the far post by the defender, where Adri appears to head it into the net\n\nFT - a calm and controlled second half by the team makes the match end with a comfortable scoreline - they had OM under control defensively much more than in the first half and pounced in the decisive moments in attack. We will get to know the opponents in the Round of 16 and the possible path through the rest of the tournament on Friday\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 16:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee:** Sam Barrott (ENG) \n\n**Competition:** UEFA Youth League, Round of 32\n\n**Viewing options:** [RMTV/RM PLAY](https://play.realmadrid.com/home)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Juvenil A XI (4-3-3):** Illia Voloshyn - Diego Aguado, Mario Rivas (59' Victor Valdepe\u00f1as 'Valde'), Joan Mart\u00ednez, Jes\u00fas Fortea - Jorge Cestero (Diego Mart\u00ednez 'Beto'), Carlos D\u00edez, Thiago Pitarch - Alexis Ciria (83' Adri P\u00e9rez), Adri\u00e1n Arnuncio \u2018Arnu\u2019 (83'' Jacobo Ortega), Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (71' Gabri Valero)\n\nBench: \u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez (GK), Melvin Ukpeigbe, \u00c1lvaro Lezcano, Pol Dur\u00e1n. \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro L\u00f3pez\n",

        "title": "The contradiction between transfers and the reality of football",
        "content": "Football is a very short lived sport. Managers nowadays barely last more than two seasons, after two losses in a row it\u00b4s crisis, what happened the season before doesn\u00b4t really count, what could potentially happen in two years after also doesn\\`t.  Real Madrid is probably the pinnacle of that.\n\nOn the other side more and more big clubs are signing project players. Players who obviously have talent, but who are still raw and who still need a bit of time. So Real Madrid signed the likes of Vinicius, Rodrygo, Reinier, Endrick, Mastantuono, Camavinga, Hujisen. Man City signed the likes of Khusanov, Victor Reis, Doku, Savinho. Chelsea signed so many like talented 20 year olds, they are basically hoarding talent.\n\nNow this works as long as there is an experienced core of players around kind of leading them. So Real Madrid were fine when the likes of Kroos, Modric, a fit version of Carvajal, Benzema...were still around. It actually looked like they got the transition spot on. Man City were fine when they still had De Bruyne, Walker, the peak versions of Ruben Dias and Rodri leading the team. \n\nProblems start when the experienced core of players is starting to fail. In Real Madrid\u00b4s case the current experienced core of players age wise (apart from Courtois) is Carvajal, Alaba, R\u00fcdiger, Mendy, maybe Ceballos. 4 players who have had massive injury issues and one player who has never really been more than a squad player. After that you have the likes of Militao and Trent, who have also had big injury problems this season. The oldest outfield player who is actually playing is Valverde at 27. \n\n3 of Real Madrid\u00b4s back four currently are Carreras, Hujisen and Asencio. I\u00b4m happy all three of them are at the club, I think they could all have good careers at the club but they probably shouldn\u00b4t be starting together at this point in their career. \n\nCompare that to the Champions League winning sides of Real Madrid in the last 15 years. The youngest starting 11 in a final was the la decima starting eleven and the average age was 26.7 years and it would have been older if Xabi Alonso hadn\u00b4t been suspended and Pepe had been fit to start. \n\n",

I personally think endrick will do a better job than him on rw or even arda is more dangerous on rw.. he may has the pressing thing better than others and that\u2019s why arbeloa and even xabi likes to start him. But i think this transfer window we should have bought someone a bit better and a natural rw .. i maybe wrong in the future i hope im wrong and he will succeed and be our next Di maria.",

The 2020\u201321 season was their first season. This was the 22nd meeting of the women's Cl\u00e1sico and Real Madrid has only won once. The matches are very rarely close.

Easily a top-five worst signing in the club\u2019s history.\n\nAnyways.. he\u2019s still only 24. I hope he manages to find himself again. Maybe he\u2019ll get another chance to play in Europe.",

        "content": "I think it is obvious we have too many similar profiles, but this area is just overwhelmed. Bellingham, Brahim, Mastantuono, Guler and soon Nico Paz. We have too many players who thrive the best at that position. And the other problem is that they perform horribly if put at a different position. Bellingham hasn\u2019t been the same since he was given defensive responsibility and was dropped deeper. Guler has amazing vision, but has little impact when playing deep in the midfield. Brahim and Mastantuono are bench players, but who are not quite good at wingers to constantly play there. Brahim will probably be sold and Mastantuono may get loaned out. And most importantly, Guler and Bellingham can\u2019t work together which will definitely be hard to deal with.",

        "title": "How Simone Inzaghi would be an underrated alternative for Real Madrid",
        "content": "I think Simone Inzaghi should be a serious contender for a future Real Madrid manager, if Arbeloa leaves this summer. And if not then, further ahead in the future.\n\nUnlike Tuchel, Emery, and Klopp, who are the most common names circulating, his system does not revolve around a high press, which we realistically will never get with our current squad.\n\nInstead of high pressing, he focuses on defensive shape and structure, similar to how Ancelotti would ask our CB\u2019s and Mendy to stay back while allowing our front three more freedom. His system is filled with quick vertical football and counters, which would suit our pace and speed offensively. Most Real Madrid fans probably thought of him as a manager while watching the Inter Milan vs Barcelona matchup in the Champions League. Last but not least, his system does not revolve around possession, which helps hide the fact that we clearly lack a tempo setter and have more of a physical than technical midfield.\n\nHe is extremely pragmatic in the way he sets his teams up and truly a big game manager. Having taken an aging Inter Milan side to two Champions League finals in four years, drawn against us with Al Hilal, and even beaten Manchester City with them. His personality is calm and collected and likely would not cause the same friction as managers like Conte or Tuchel.\n\nLooking at the managerial market for next summer, he is probably the top level coach least dependent on high pressing football and heavy possession, aside from Ancelotti after the Brazil job. For those reasons, I think these factors make him a realistic fit for Real Madrid.\n\nThoughts?\n\nEDIT:\n\nIt seems many people claim that he has underachieved in the league, and while I understand that argument, Serie A is far less predictable than La Liga. Even Carlo Ancelotti, who had an amazing European career with AC Milan, did not dominate Serie A in the same way.\n\nAs for comparisons with managers such as Tuchel and Klopp, the intention of this post was to highlight tactical compatibility with our current squad. I believe Inzaghi could start winning with only minor additions, whereas the others would likely require a full rebuild for heavy pressing system like gegenpressing. I personally cannot see Klopp returning to management anytime soon, and I do not believe Tuchel would be willing to work here given his previous tensions with mbappe at PSG and potentially with Bellingham in England (depending on how the World Cup goes and whether he starts regularly).",
