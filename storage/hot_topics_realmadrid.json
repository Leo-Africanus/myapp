        "content": "Lately, I can't help but feel a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as a Madridista. The 2024/25 season is starting to mirror the events of the 2014/15 campaign in some uncanny ways.\n\nBack in 2014, under Carlo, we started the season on a high, winning both the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup. Expectations were massive. But as the season went on, things began to slip. We fell short in La Liga, got knocked out in the Copa del Rey, and exited the Champions League in the semi-finals. To make matters worse, Barcelona capitalized on our decline and went on to win the treble.\n\nCarlo was sacked at the end of that season. He was replaced by former player Rafa Ben\u00edtez, but that experiment didn\u2019t last long. By mid-season, Ben\u00edtez was gone, and another ex-player stepped up: Zinedine Zidane, who went on to carry us from chaos to glory.  \n\nNow, fast forward to this season. Once again, we started strong by winning the UEFA Super Cup, and we have CWC to play. But despite the solid start, there\u2019s an unsettling sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, key injuries piling up, dropped points at crucial moments, and doubts creeping in just when we need momentum the most. Meanwhile, Barcelona are finding their rhythm and are in the mix for a potential treble once again (HOPEFULLY FUCKING NOT).\n\nTo top it off, Carlo is set to depart, not by sacking this time, but via mutual agreement and with another former player likely stepping in to take the reins. The parallels are undeniable.\n\nMaybe it's fate. Maybe it's the end of a cycle. But just like last time, I believe this could be the foundation for something even greater. After all, what followed 2015 was the beginning of one of the most dominant eras in Champions League history.\n\nLet\u2019s hope we\u2019re about to witness another rebirth. What's your thoughts guys?",

I write this mostly because, in my opinion, we need number 9 (which we lack since Benzema and Joselu left) who will score on a daily basis. Now we have 3 top players who fight for same position (LW), and that doesn't look good to me at all. So if we had to sign a number 9, who will it be? \n\nEdit: This is 'what if' post, so let's imagine",
