        "content": "As the title says, these other La Liga teams are going to keep getting penalized for their silly mistakes as long as they continue to play the type of football they do. One thing about these teams (except for Barcelona) is whenever they play Madrid it's usually a very rough game, they get too physical, constantly pulling shirts, constantly trying to hurt our players or \"degame\" them. And honestly I don't actually understand the thought process behind their managers, it's like their only mission is to get on the pitch and play as much fouls as possible, what type of football is that? They don't come to win points, they come to park the bus and commit so many fouls it's like they're wrestling out there.\nThis shit also happened against Atletico, those guys were constantly fouling us but the ref let them all slide somehow... And when they finally get booked with a red card it's always \"Vardrid\" or \"Ref carried Madrid\"..bro if you keep fouling us what do you expect? We have players like Vini who are very clever with getting you booked but still you keep fouling the same guy? Are these managers dumb or what? Honestly!",

        "content": "Firstly im no manager, xabi understands better what really is going on, but im noticing fede and tchua are incompaptible with each other in 4-2-3-1. In this double pivot system, whenever 1 performs, the other looks a bit lost. Fede looked great with players like Cebbalos on the pitch tho. Which is why many of our losses or underwhelming performances agaisnt athleti, marseille, sociedad have come from 4-2-3-1. We havent been able to handle ball distribution or create/convert chances in this system. The best ive seen them play as a team was in a 3-4-2-1 against levante, but thats the only game. Would be great if we try that tactic more, cause thats xabi's orignal tactic with leverkusen and would be perfect when our rbs are injured rn.  ",
