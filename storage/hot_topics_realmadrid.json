I really really want to see them and hoping to get an autograph or two on a shirt.\n\nCould anyone please help me out here! There are just too many good hotels to choose from in London and they haven't played arsenal in ages so no reference to use. With the UCL final, they used the grove and with Chelsea, it was one in st James park but that would be far from the Emirates\n\nThanks!",

        "content": "I understand the last two times round we've been thrashed by Barcelona but there were critical squad issues that hadn't yet been resolved. Firstly, Tchouameni was struggling heavily to adapt to CB (we hadn't yet discovered Asencio), Vasquez started at RB (we hadn't yet played Fede in that position) and we were still kind of poor on giving Fran Garcia minutes. \n\nI think with starting the same team we started against Manchester City, bar Dani and Mendy of course, we actually have a solid chance of winning this thing. I've seen a lot of Madrid fans with a big lack of faith every time we play against Barcelona or even for the Arsenal match next week. Madrid is the best club in the world by a large margin. We are obliged to win every final. With the new discoveries to our lineup this game can be won, as can all the rest.\n\nDon't even talk to me about yesterday either by the way. Vasquez starts again, Alaba shouldn't have even been on the pitch and Camavinga out of position. Oversight by Carlo, but this Barcelona game is ours to lose if our starting XI is as it should be.\n\nHala Madrid, Vamossss!!!",

We need masterclass individual performances from the likes of Mbappe, Jude, Vini otherwise we are doomed. \n\nWe go into this match as a clear underdog. ",

First question, when is the full schedule for the season usually released? Second question, how is it decided who plays homes and away? I have seen the last few seasons the first game has always been away. Final question is where is the best place to get tickets from? Just want to say thanks in advance for any help! ",
