        "content": "#FT: OSASUNA B 1:0 CASTILLA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#1\u00aa FEDERACI\u00d3N\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:** \n\n1:0 Ander Yoldi 22'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - kick off, vamos! \n\n5' - the streaming platform is showing the wrong match... Every year it's a new platform, but the same incompetence in this league... \n\n15' - first quarter of an hour is gone, LaLiga+ has not noticed their error so far, and I still can't watch the game - I hope the team started well... \n\n\u26bd 22' - Osasuna score - I still cannot watch the match\n\n35' - 34 minutes played, and they finally put the correct match! \n\nHT - obviously I could only watch the last 10 minutes, but the way Castilla are playing is straight up alarming, they fail to create any danger at all, can't get tempo into their attacking and are also shaky in defense despite little pressure by Osasuna who focus on defending their lead\n\n46' - 2nd half underway \n\n\ud83d\udd04 59' - first sub, Y\u00e1\u00f1ez on for Pol Fortuny \n\n\ud83d\udd04 66' - next sub, Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga for Thiago Pitarch. An absolutely terrible second half of the team so far, absolutely no danger whatsoever\n\n70' - Fran Gonz\u00e1lez keeps the team in the match with a great 1v1 save after an easy counter by Osasuna - this team needs to wake up! \n\n76' - a penalty is reviewed for a pull on Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, but the ref does not change his decision. For me, it was not enough\n\n\ud83d\udd04 78' - Palacios off for Gabri Castrelo, last sub \n\n79' - first good chance for Castilla in possibly the entire game - Castrelo's shot from a tight angle is saved nicely by their keeper\n\n82' - Aguado takes a rebound on the volley nicely, but it flies just over the bar \n\nFT - an absolutely awful performance by Castilla leads to the third loss in a row, without scoring a single goal, or I'd even say, without generating a single clear cut chance for the past 270 minutes. With the U20 World Cup coming up and Fortea, Pitarch, Cristian, Fran and Aguado being out for at least a month, this situation can go from bad to worse if Arbeloa doesn't rethink everything about the way he sets up this team, this way of playing doesn't work, we need to give up the control so there is some space to play into, especially since we don't have any attacker that can make the difference by himself against a tough defence\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 12:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Instalaciones Deportivas de Tajonar, Pamplona\n\n**Referee**: Aimar Velasco Arbaiza\n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 1, Matchday 4\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[LaLiga+](https://www.laligaplus.laliga.com/) (subscription - 14.99\u20ac/month) (only available in Spain)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-3-3): Fran Gonz\u00e1lez - Diego Aguado, Lamini Fati, Joan Mart\u00ednez, Jesus Fortea - Jorge Cestero, Thiago Pitarch (66' Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga), Manuel \u00c1ngel - Bruno Iglesias, C\u00e9sar Palacios (78' Gabri Castrelo), Pol Fortuny (59' Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez) \n\nBench: Guille S\u00fanico (GK), Alejandro Moya, Mario Rivas, Manu Serrano, V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as, Cristian David, Roberto Mart\u00edn, Jacobo Ortega. \n\nUnavailable: Sergio Mestre (first team call-up), David Jim\u00e9nez (first team call-up), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Rachad Fettal (injury). \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** WWLL\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 16th | 3pt | 1-0-2 | 2:3\n",

        "title": "Have you ever thought Benzema was overshadowed by CR7 and Bale?",
        "content": "When CR7 and Bale played for Real Madrid, almost everything were built around these two and as it planned, they made it; they were so good at dribbling, at scoring, at assisting, at passing that every Madridista loved them. However, Benzema looked like he was overshadowed by them; he couldn't score and assist as they could but I don't think it was about him being bad or something. He wasn't in the plans enough about scoring; I felt like he was more like responsible for establishing the pass connections in the forward line for CR7 and Bale. After all of these, when we were in 2022, CR7 wasn't already there, Bale wasn't even thought like he was there. It was the time for Benzema; everything was built around him, he became the captain, he played as a pure 9. When that happened, he performed the best, including all of his time in Real Madrid. He won against PSG completely all himself, He was in a critical role winning against City. Briefly, it wouldn't be weird if we said It was all for Benzema 80%-90% of success Real Madrid had in 21/22 season. Considering all this, I feel like Benzema was unfortunately really overshadowed rest of his times other than 21/22 here. What do you think?",

        "title": "Why do people hate that Mbappe drops deep to collect the ball ?",
        "content": "In games with limited midfield creativity, he must step down to collect the ball. R9 used to do this: he would take the ball from midfield and dribble into the opposing goal, either creating a chance or scoring. \n\nSo far, it's working, and if he hadn't done it against Espanyol, he'd have looked like Gonzalo Garcia, waiting indefinitely for that one chance.\n\n Furthermore, not standing in the box allows you to collect the cutback (which I believe is Cam's responsibility). I also believe that making Mbappe wait for the ball in the box wastes his talent. \n\nMy solution is that when Mbappe drifts wide, someone should fill in the space (Jude would be really good at this), and he just has to stay there and have a presence in the box, plus he's quite tall.",

        "title": "Do we still need a Midfield Controller?",
        "content": "So we all know that last year our biggest issue was that Toni Kroos was not replaced and we suffered from a lack of a high volume, accurate, press resistant and creative passer to circulate and progress the ball from defence to attack. We eventually used Ceballos who then got injured and finally we settled Modric and Arda who couldn't really keep up with the physical demands of the game against energetic opposition for a full 90 minutes. \n\nThis season we still have Ceballos but he's inconsistent. And we have Arda who still struggles against physical opponents. \n\nBut what if we don't actually have the same need for a midfield controller as we did last season? What if the reason we needed one so bad was because we had Mendy/Fran as our LB and Rudiger paired with Ascenicio as our CBs and Lord Vazquez as our RB? \n\nWith Carreras, Huijsen, Militao and Trent/Carvajal, we have an infinitely more competent back line that is very capable of passing around and dribbling through the initial press. In Dean we have our highest volume and most accurate passer. He switches play and is extremely press resistant. Trent too is very adept at the short and long passing game. Militao and Carreras are no slouches on the ball and can also dribble out of pressure.\n\nNow add Tchouameni to the above and then ask yourself, in such a scenario do we actually need a dedicated DLP? Especially when we don't have one that's a perfect fit? \n\nI think Camavinga, Fede and Bellingham are all more than good enough to do the ball carrying required to help move the ball from this competent defence to our attackers.

This is not a critique to Valverde, he is my favorite player in Madrid, but it is evident he has not been the most important part of the team anymore. So, why is Valverde not as highlighted as he used to? I believe it is because of being given a specific role. Valverde is a kind of player that should play out of scheme. He was the one who ran everywhere on the pitch and made sure to contribute everywhere. However, this is also a good sign, the fact that Valverde is not being seen as much means that the team is not a mess like last year. If Valverde is the best player in the team that\u2019s unfortunately a bad sign. I feel like he should one of the only players in the team with no instructions since he is the best at moving around the pitch to contribute. ",

        "title": "[AthleticFC] Real Madrid\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or boycott is a story of politics and paranoia",
        "content": "The Ballon d\u2019Or ceremony is arguably the most glamorous and important event in the football calendar, when the European game\u2019s best players and coaches are recognised in front of a global audience of millions.\n\nFor many players, winning a Ballon d\u2019Or is among their biggest career objectives, so it is hard to comprehend why Real Madrid have essentially decided to boycott the event, a decision influenced most of all by their powerful president, Florentino Perez.\n\nThere was shock last year when the Spanish club decided, at the very last minute and with 50 members of staff ready to travel, that they would not attend. That choice was made after learning that none of their seven nominated players \u2014 including Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham (who finished second and third) \u2014 had won the men\u2019s award, which was claimed by Manchester City\u2019s Rodri.\n\nAwkwardly, it meant Carlo Ancelotti was unable to receive the Johan Cruyff trophy, his prize as best men\u2019s coach for 2024, and nobody from Madrid was there to accept the award for club of the year. Ancelotti, who was replaced by Xabi Alonso as Madrid manager in May, only finally got his hands on his award last week. The Spanish club acknowledged neither of the prizes.\n\nMadrid\u2019s men\u2019s players will once again be absent from this year\u2019s event in Paris, despite Vinicius Jr, Bellingham and Kylian Mbappe again being nominated for the main men\u2019s prize. Thibaut Courtois could win the Yashin Trophy for the best goalkeeper and 20-year-old centre-back Dean Huijsen is a nominee for the Kopa Trophy for the world\u2019s best under-21 player.\n\nTo help explain the situation, The Athletic held over two dozen conversations with current and former Madrid staff, sources close to current and former players and coaches, as well as other industry figures who have dealt directly with the club during Perez\u2019s two terms as president.\n\nAll requested anonymity to speak honestly about how things really work around the Bernabeu.\n\nEvery other top European football club will send delegations for tonight\u2019s glitzy gala at the Theatre du Chatelet, whether or not their players are likely to win any prizes.\n\nBut for Madrid, it seems as if the Ballon d\u2019Or just does not exist \u2014 the award has not been mentioned on any of its official media channels. All the sources consulted for this article, who would be well-placed to know, agreed that the decision for Madrid to adopt such an attitude could only have been made by Perez.\n\nDuring his two spells as president (2000-2006 and 2009 onwards), the now-78-year-old has centralised power at the club so that every final decision is his to make.\n\n\u201cFlorentino controls everything: football matters, communication, business, every department of the club, he is over them all,\u201d says a source who has dealt regularly with Madrid over the past decade.\n\nBut the Ballon d\u2019Or stance has caused problems for other club staff whose jobs involve promoting Real Madrid and dealing with sponsors and other commercial partners. As the highest-profile awards ceremony in football, it can polish the club\u2019s image and grow its fanbase. Boycotting it in such an abrupt manner was seen by many internally as a PR own goal last year.\n\n\u201cA lot of people at the club, probably the majority, thought it was a terrible decision, particularly the timing of it and the way it was communicated,\u201d says a staff source. \u201cIt generated a lot of frustration.\u201d\n\nFor many around the Bernabeu, it was just another example of the \u2018siege mentality\u2019 of Perez\u2019s presidency. Multiple sources told The Athletic that Perez has long believed Spain can be divided into those who love Real Madrid and those who hate it. One summed up the general feeling by saying: \u201cFlorentino really believes that half of Spain are Madrid fans and the other half are anti-Madridistas.\u201d\n\nUEFA and its president, Aleksander Ceferin, joined this list of \u2018anti-Madridistas\u2019 after Perez\u2019s breakaway European Super League project quickly collapsed in April 2021. Sources familiar with Perez\u2019s thinking said they believed UEFA influenced the decision not to award last year\u2019s prize to a Madrid player as a direct consequence of Madrid continuing to push the Super League project, even though \u200b\u200bthe Ballon d\u2019Or awards are decided by a vote of 100 independent journalists.\n\nMultiple sources maintain that many of Madrid\u2019s longer-serving staff, especially in the communications department, believe that much of the world is actively working against them. This perspective helps explain the vehemence and animosity with which Real Madrid TV (RMTV) pursues perceived enemies of the club, such as Spanish referees, or Barcelona president Joan Laporta.\n\nContent is not directly scripted by Perez or the club hierarchy, but all at the station know the editorial line they are required to take against anybody deemed an \u2018anti-Madridista\u2019. A former club employee says that the TV station, which is broadcast free-to-air in Spain and available globally online, is important to Perez \u201cfor political messaging reasons\u201d.\n\nSuch control of the messaging by Perez, who wanted to be a politician before he became a very successful businessman, has helped push through changes to Madrid club statutes that seriously limit the number of potential challengers to his presidency. It has also helped continue support for the European Super League project, and aided the constant battles for money and power with La Liga\u2019s president, Javier Tebas.\n\nStorms of outrage also help distract fans during moments when the team is not performing well. Last year\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or boycott came just hours after Clasico rivals Barcelona had humiliated Madrid in a 4-0 defeat at the Bernabeu. The club\u2019s angriest criticism of referees exploded in early 2025, just as the team were struggling badly through a season that they ended without winning any major trophies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re against everyone and everything,\u201d one RMTV pundit said on air immediately after last year\u2019s Copa del Rey final against Barca. Madrid\u2019s hierarchy let it be known they were considering boycotting that game, after the match referees emotionally complained about videos accusing them of bias that were broadcast in the days leading up to it.\n\nBarca won the trophy, but instead of analysing another lost Clasico, Madrid fans were fed the message that the club hierarchy were once more protecting them from attacks on all sides.\n\nWhen the 2025 Ballon d\u2019Or nominees were announced in early August, Madrid did not even acknowledge the news on their website or social channels.\n\nOn the women\u2019s side of the club, Scotland international Caroline Weir is among the female nominees and is expected to travel, but there has been no public acknowledgement of that achievement from Madrid. Team-mate Linda Caicedo\u2019s nomination for the under-21 award has not been celebrated either.\n\nAround the club, there is a recognition that Perez\u2019s views on UEFA and media outlet France Football, joint organisers of the prize, have not changed. Most staff, and multiple sources close to nominated men\u2019s team players, had long accepted that they would again not be attending.\n\nWhile no Madrid player is likely to win this year\u2019s main men\u2019s award, even being nominated is a huge opportunity for players, given the global exposure. There is also the individual feeling of importance and recognition, so important for top competitors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve no opinion about that at all,\u201d was the ironic and resigned take of someone close to a Madrid player.\n\nLast week, a Madrid club source said the men\u2019s players would find it difficult to travel to Paris because of the Tuesday night kick-off (at 9.30pm local time) against Levante the next day.\n\nAnother irony of the whole situation is how the Ballon d\u2019Or has previously been crucially important to Perez\u2019s project at Madrid. Many of the \u2018galactico\u2019 signings of his first presidency were winners of the individual men\u2019s award \u2014 including Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Michael Owen and Ronaldo. During his second spell, Madrid were very publicly proud when Cristiano Ronaldo (2013, 2014, 2016, 2017), Luka Modric (2018) and Karim Benzema (2022) took the prize.\n\n\u201cThey should give a Ballon d\u2019Or for the best president, too,\u201d Perez joked on Spanish radio station Cadena Ser while attending the 2017 ceremony. Few around the Bernabeu find humour in the club\u2019s relationship with the award these days.\n\nMost sources consulted for this article maintained that, in the end, whether or not players attend the Ballon d\u2019Or ceremony, or whether or not RMTV go after referees, the team\u2019s performances on the pitch are not affected. Madrid have won 37 trophies over the 22 completed seasons of Perez\u2019s two presidencies, and revenues have grown by many multiples to almost \u20ac1.2billion (\u00a31bn; $1.4bn) during 2024-25, the highest in world football.\n\nYet there are costs in the constant battles against perceived enemies. Outside the Madridista bubble, damage is being done to the club\u2019s image. Among those who ultimately suffer are players, coaches, staff, and everyone who has to live and work in such an environment of tension and paranoia.\n\n\u201cThat noise does not help, being against the world,\u201d says the agent of a former Madrid player.\n\n\u201cA club like Madrid cannot be fighting everyone: La Liga, UEFA, France Football. Madrid is very big but the policy of the club \u2014 the referees, the videos \u2014 I really cannot understand.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t always be fighting against everyone.\u201d",
