These things take time but honestly PSG game aside, I think the outcome was very positive. \n\nThe fact that Xabi was willing to play the best players for each role over bigger names and he was willing to bench Vini against PSG speaks volumes. I honestly think that youngsters like Arda and franco mastantuono will be able to shine this season, they are the type of players that Xabi loves, players that can play direct and fast paced football.\n\n3 incidents happened. Xabi was forced to play Vini as his intention was to bench him, and he was forced to play Valverde as an RB. On top of that, 2 stupid mistakes from our CBs made the situation even worse. We would have seen a different game if it werent for these incidents. \n\nIf Rodrygo gets sold, I think we could see Vini have a lesser role in the team unless he is able to turn his form around and adapt to Xabi ball. I think Xabi is willing to play Mbappe and Garcia together upfront with players like Arda, Bello and Franco to support them.",

Not to mention his beef with the club. On the other hand we have Enzo, he is extremely expensive and has performed well already, but his price is not worth what he brings in my opinion. Great player, but he is not the best at game creation. Then we have Mac from Liverpool, who is my favorite. He has already proved himself and is also someone who can play deeper and also break lines. However, I don\u2019t think he is the best option. He is too expensive and will be tough to buy. Then we have the obvious option (imo), Stiller. Stiller is not only great at creating game, and making long passes. But he is also young and cheap. Angelo Stiller this season had stats basically identical to Kroos. Having one of the highest percentage passes and making a lot of long passes. He is cheap, young and recommended by Kroos. If you ask me I don\u2019t know why we wouldn\u2019t go for him. Who do you think is the best option?",

They\u2019re legends of their own, you see them all pressing, running behind the ball. You even see Cristiano at minute 75 in our area defending a corner. That\u2019s why we won 3 CL in a row. Nobody complained about anyone\u2019s work rate and they all ran. That was a team. We have some of the best players in each position at this day and age and I believe things can work out but our team has an attitude problem not necessarily lack of quality or tactics and I do think even Vini and Mbappe can play together. I hope Xabi\u2019s presence shows that he is not there to make friends but to mold a bunch of players into a team. If they all collectively put as much heart as Valverde does, we would steamroll most teams in La Liga and compete against the big ones in Europe. ",

They should still start games tho but maybe against smaller teams first",
