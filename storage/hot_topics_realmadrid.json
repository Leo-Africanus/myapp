        "content": "Testimony was an hour long. I gather some of the important  bits and translated them. \n\n\nRelationship with Negreira\n\nClaim: Laporta said FC Barcelona never dealt with Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Enr\u00edquez Negreira, only with his son (Javier Enr\u00edquez), who supposedly produced the reports.\n\nContradiction:\n\nFormer president Sandro Rosell testified that Negreira senior personally carried out the reports.\n\nEmails exist between Laporta and Negreira senior, contradicting the claim that they never spoke or dealt with each other.\n\n\nAdditional inconsistency:\n\nLaporta said he didn\u2019t even know Negreira senior was Vice President of the Referees\u2019 Committee, which is widely considered implausible.\n\nWho Supposedly Wrote the Reports\n\nClaim: Laporta said Negreira\u2019s son was responsible for preparing the refereeing reports.\n\nContradictions:\n\nAt the time, Negreira\u2019s son was part of Fenerbah\u00e7e\u2019s coaching staff, raising serious doubts about:\n\nHow he had the time\n\nHow he could perform detailed Bar\u00e7a-specific referee analysis\n\n\nRosell\u2019s testimony directly contradicts this, stating the father, not the son, did the work.\n\n\nExistence and Destruction of Reports\n\nClaim: Laporta said reports were routinely destroyed every five years.\n\nContradictions:\n\nLaporta later appeared at a press conference with red boxes full of reports and CDs, allegedly containing hundreds of reports.\n\nHe even displayed two specific reports from 2012, contradicting the claim of systematic destruction.\n\nHundreds of reports later \u201cappeared\u201d in storage, despite allegedly being destroyed years earlier.\n\n\nKnowledge of Payments\n\nClaim: Laporta said he never knew about the payments or their amounts, because presidents don\u2019t approve all expenses.\n\nContradictions:\n\nHe later stated that any payment over \u20ac3,000 requires board approval, contradicting his earlier claim of ignorance.\n\nHe personally justified a dramatic increase in payments, meaning he must have known about both:\n\nThe existence of the payments\n\nTheir amounts\n\nEscalation of Payments\n\nClaim: Laporta justified quadrupling the payments by saying there were \u201cmore matches and more competitions.\u201d\n\nContradiction:\n\nThis explanation requires detailed knowledge of the payments, directly contradicting his claim that he didn\u2019t know about them.\n\nThe increase (from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of euros annually) is considered grossly disproportionate to any increase in matches.\n\n\nCoaches and the Alleged Reports\n\nClaim: Laporta stated that all coaches received and used the refereeing reports.\n\nContradictions (sworn testimony):\n\nLuis Enrique:\n\n&gt; \u201cIn six years as a coach, nobody showed me a single refereeing report, neither to me nor my staff.\u201d\n\n\n\nErnesto Valverde:\n\n&gt; \u201cI was never offered nor shown any refereeing reports.\u201d\n\n\n\nThese are the primary intended recipients of such reports, making Laporta\u2019s claim untenable.\n\nSuspicious Invoices\n\nInvoice 1 \u2013 \u201cAloe Vera Gifts\u201d\n\nFC Barcelona paid \u20ac60,000 to a Negreira-linked company for an invoice labeled \u201caloe vera gift packs\u201d.\n\nNo credible explanation was provided as to how this relates to refereeing analysis.\n\n\nInvoice 2 \u2013 2010 World Cup Referee Report\n\nBar\u00e7a paid for a report analyzing referees at the 2010 World Cup before the tournament even took place.\n\nThis suggests billing for services that could not yet have been performed.\n\n\nOverall Pattern Highlighted by the Testimony\n\nRepeated use of:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know\u201d\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t my responsibility\u201d\n\n\nContradictions between:\n\nLaporta\u2019s statements\n\nDocumentary evidence (emails, invoices)\n\nTestimony from other presidents\n\nTestimony from coaches\n\n\nA central defense (\u201cthe payments were for reports\u201d) that is directly undermined by every coach who should have received them\n\n\nBottom Line\n\nLaporta simultaneously claims:\n\nHe didn\u2019t know about the payments\n\nHe justified increasing them\n\nThe reports were vital\n\nThe reports were never seen by the coaches\n\n\nThese positions cannot logically coexist.",

        "content": "Imo, our fanbase is definently spoiled if not the most spoiled fanbase itw, we can't face an obstacle without throwing fingers at random people and saying they're at fault.\n\nRodrygo scored 2 goals in 2 games so far and did the same celebration like he always does, kisses the badge and calls it a day. Anyone who doubted him in the first place is a clown, cuz there is no way that you watched this guy play games (not on insta reels) and still end up saying he's a \"waste\". Theirry henry went out on sky sports and said rodrygo is not normal. Jude bellingham himself went out and publicly called rodrygo the most talented player in the squad. \n\nYou can't blame a guy for not scoring in 32 games when he only started in 4 of them. Laliga today is just Barca, Real and 18 other teams that play nothing but low block football. You can't expect rodrygo to get subbed in and score a hattrick everytime. Vini hasn't scored in 12 games so far no one's making that much noise about it.\n\nHe came on against almaty in the 60-70th min and provided 2 assists. Went in to his 2nd ucl start this season against city and he immediately scored, is that a coincidence? I don't think so. The league is a very different story compared to the ucl, especially when its laliga.",

        "title": "It is everyone\u2019s fault",
        "content": "I\u2019ve been watching Real Madrid since 2000, and this era is starting to remind me of the Gal\u00e1cticos era.\n\nWe had unreal individual talent back then, but as a collective, it never truly clicked. I\u2019m starting to feel the same pattern now: too much talent, not enough cohesion, and unclear leadership from the top.\n\nUpper Management\n\nThis situation starts with upper management. Their lack of clear and public support for Xabi is a major issue. We\u2019ve seen this story before  it\u2019s exactly why Zidane walked away during his second stint. When a coach feels like every match is a final, it creates fear, not progress.\n\nXabi is constantly under pressure, with the feeling that one bad result could cost him his job. Realistically, how many coaches can work intelligently and build something long-term under that threat? Upper management needs to be decisive: either fully back Xabi or just fire him and bring back Carlo lol.\n\nFlorentino also needs to be firm with Vini. Either sign the contract or accept reduced minutes. No one, regardless of talent, should be bigger than the club. If others are performing better or fitting the system, they deserve playing time.\n\nSquad planning has also been poor. Madrid should have signed more players. We are clearly short in defense  at least one or two more center-backs were needed \u2014and we desperately need another midfielder who can consistently progress the ball and control tempo. Right now, we\u2019re relying too much on individual brilliance instead of structure same as the Carlo era.\n\nPlayers\n\nSeveral players have been underperforming since last season, and not enough has changed. Jude needs to accept that replicating his 23/24 season is unrealistic. That season was exceptional, and asking him to carry the team again isn\u2019t fair to him or the squad.\n\nVini hasn\u2019t been at his best, and honestly, I think his contract situation is affecting him. He\u2019s an emotional player, and when his head isn\u2019t right, it shows. I believe once his future is settled, we\u2019ll see a much better version of him again.\n\nThat said, Vini\u2019s moment at El Cl\u00e1sico hurt the team\u2019s morale. Leadership isn\u2019t just about talent \u2014 it\u2019s about composure. When emotions take over, the entire team feels it. Believe me I love Vini and I have every kit that he wore since he joined Real except this season. It breaks my heart to see him like this.\n\nDefensively, many of the goals we\u2019ve conceded come from the same issue, half the team presses while the other half stands and watches. That\u2019s not just a player problem  that\u2019s a system and communication problem.\n\nXabi Alonso\n\nDespite everything, I\u2019m still on Xabi\u2019s side. He showed real promise earlier this season, and he\u2019s been dealt with injuries, ego management, and a squad that wasn\u2019t fully built for his ideas or players that want to believe in his system. \n\nI used to complain a lot about Carlo because we lacked a clear tactical identity. The \u201cCarlo system\u201d relied too heavily on individual moments, and that approach isn\u2019t sustainable long-term. Xabi, at least, is trying to implement a structure  but structure takes time.\n\nThat said, Xabi isn\u2019t blameless. He should have handled Vini better in El Cl\u00e1sico instead of ignoring the situation. Managing stars is part of the job at Madrid.\n\nI also criticize the constant lineup changes. While injuries explain some of it, stability matters. Players need chemistry, especially in midfield and defense.\n\nFinally, Xabi needs to recognize that Jude and Arda cannot play together if Jude is our number 10. The balance just isn\u2019t there, and it hurts both players rather than helping either of them.",

The frustrating thing is that even playing DLP in the Club World Cup, he was so much more involved in the attack\n\nIs there no principle or system which can utilise Arda\u2019s creativity and long shots in the final third?",

        "title": "Vinicius. A balanced overview of his past, current and future issues",
        "content": "I'll just take some words to talk about Vini. I might leave some questions unanswered and some lines of thought unexplored but here's what I think is a general overview of why he hasn't been playing well and what this means about him as a player, particularly in the future. Is he finished? Let's find out.\n\nForm is confidence, and vini is low on it atm. Take Rodrygo as an example. He scores no goals in 32 games but now has scored back to back. \n\nI'll state my perception of the reason why(he's low on confidence) but keep it brief. I think it's a combination of multiple things that hit its tipping point at the el clasico substitution.\n\nRemember, it's a confidence issue. My feeling is that it revolves around doubts about where he stands with the club and whether or not he's wanted here. There's a couple indicators of this. There's the ballon d'or mbappe signing, the club's unwillingness to commit to a contract with him. People use these things to criticize his mentality but these feelings ARE VALID when we apply context.\n\nVinicius has never been a weak-minded individual. We know that. We should not trivialize the impact these issues have and dismiss them. Ronaldo stated the following as his reason for leaving Madrid.\n\n&gt;I felt it inside the club, especially from the president, that they no longer considered me the same way that they did in the start.\n\nWe know Ronaldo is not a bum by any means, but even he left when he started to feel unloved &amp; unwanted, as he accurately gauged that it would affect his happiness and form.\n\nPlayers are not slaves. Even a good master knows to not ruin his servant's morale. However, we know the club can be ruthless at times. This isn't necessarily a good thing.\n\nRemember that vini was playing really well at the start of the season. He had 5G + 4A(1.08 g+a per 90) and started to get back to his very best. The team also did well in that moment. However, he was unexplainably benched or substituted in scenarios that didn't make sense. It certainly wasn't just mere rotation, neither was it due to form. I remember seeing opinions even then that Madrid were showing a \"power move\" by telling vinicius to either sign the contract or be replaced even without any signing needed. My own opinion was that it was either that or they had promised to give Rodrygo more LW minutes.\n\nThis happened multiple times until Vinicius blew up after the el clasico substitution. His behaviour was wrong and unacceptable, but understandable. We certainly can't pretend it was unwarranted either.\n\nI'm not saying it's the club(or xabi's) fault. Afterall we can't be absolutely sure that they're sending him those subliminal messages. However, for a while it looked like it. By the result, there's valid reasons to doubt if xabi did a good job managing those tensions.\n\nVini's gone out of form since, and though now he appears to have resolved things with Xabi he had already begun on a downward spiral that would always be tricky to recover from. I don't necessarily think they reconciled immediately after El Clasico but they certainly seem to have now.\n\nI think Xabi playing him consistently now is an attempt to fix their broken relationship and by effect his confidence. This is the right step IMO. There's many different reasons to criticize a player for not doing well. But when it's a confidence issue, good managers(or leaders in general) know to not ruin the player's mindset further and to instead show trust in them. Particularly when the player is quality and there are tangible reasons behind their decline in form. It usually is worth it when you believe your chances are better in the long-term with the player. \"**Form is temporary, Class is permanent**\".  \n  \nThe only issue I have is that while showing trust in him is the right move, some might agree that it now feels like an overcompensation and he's playing too many minutes. While xabi is obviously attempting to fix the situation, my personal opinion is that it would have been better if he hadn't contributed to it deteriorating in the first place.\n\nI still think things can turn out fine. Unlike a lot of opinions I've seen claiming that Vini &amp; Mbappe cannot work together(sometimes Jude is thrown in there as well), I think they both can work perfectly and make us clearly the most dangerous front line in Europe. I think losing either of them would be a downgrade. Remember that they each had 49 G+A and 41 G+A last season while being largely out of form for large chunks of it. This is very promising and should be remembered before we make claims that this project won't work. Though either can be replaced, it'd be a big loss if we fumbled either of these players in their prime.\n\nThat being said, neither player is perfect and both still have a lot to learn to play well as a duo. It's largely on Xabi to teach them and help them make that connection. I personally think he has under performed in this regard, although I won't go into details here. He's been trending in the right direction for a couple games now but at a time in the season his tactical requirements for both of them actually made things worse.\n\nThe major question remaining is whether or not the contract situation will get resolved. If it does, it'll be a huge boost for Vinicius. If it doesn't, he'll be forced to leave.",

        "content": "Hello to all the so called real fans.\n\nI used to come here all the time, checking the Real Madrid subreddit for the latest club news, updates about injured players, or simply to discuss matches with you. Lately though, I get irritated the moment I see what some of you are posting, and I honestly start wondering whether some of you are actually Barcelona fans in disguise, trying to create chaos here.\n\nAll I see are absurd questions like: would we be better without Mbapp\u00e9? Or would Kane have been a better option instead? It feels like no matter how well the Frenchman performs, you still find reasons to go after him and criticize him.\n\nLast season you were glorifying Valverde and Jude, and now, almost overnight, you have turned your backs on them and want them replaced or sold. You complain nonstop about the state of the club as if you personally invested money and are now losing it because of the players. I have even seen attacks directed at P\u00e9rez. Fine, maybe we do not agree with every single decision he makes, but can we seriously not appreciate what we have? After P\u00e9rez is gone, you will all regret it, but by then it will be too late.\n\nThis subreddit is dominated by frustration, anger, and regret. Very few people actually stand by the players and the coach. Even fewer show real compassion and genuine love for the biggest football club in the world.\n\nReal Madrid, like any other team, goes through weaker periods. But because many of you are spoiled little bitches who grew up with Champions League trophies, Ballon d\u2019Or winners, and league titles almost every year, the moment things get difficult, instead of acting like real supporters, you rush to Reddit to post all kinds of nonsense.\n\nI genuinely think many of you have forgotten who Real Madrid really are. And that happens because some of you are here only for appearances, or because you support a single player rather than the team as a whole.\n\nIt is time for all of us to show that we are true Real Madrid supporters, because being a true fan of this club is a privilege. Hala Madrid!",
