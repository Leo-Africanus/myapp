This guy has been horrible since december and is barely offering anything to the team. Some people will try to gaslight me and say he\u2018s upped his game a bit since the cwc and while that is true\u2026the bar is in HELL. Like this is the number 7 for real madrid were talking about here. Those were average games at best. Nothing special and I won\u2018t be convinced otherwise. He did a successful step over against Juve and everyone celebrated it like it wasn\u2019t a completely normal thing for him a year ago. He\u2018s literally been playing like garnacho or fkn sterling. His touch is terrible, he makes too many mistakes and he literally can\u2018t beat his man on anymore?? I know I will get flamed for this and it hurts me to say this but it\u2019s true, he\u2019s not even top 10 wingers in the world.He\u2018s pressing a bit more and making simple passes now and is getting celebrated for it man like what are we doing. Give rodrygo a chance at lw and I promise he\u2018s going to be better or atleast on the same level. 100%. Vini looks like he\u2018s gained some muscle mass, he doesn\u2018t look as quick as he used to and its affecting heavily. Whatever, I dont think we should condone his bad performances any longer",

That\u2019s why his current XI only includes players who have understood Xabi-ball best and adapted to it so far. Once this Club World Cup ends, players will get their vacations and rest. Then everything starts from scratch. Mbappe and Vinicius will return as permanent starters, and have the time and freedom in preseason and the new season to make mistakes, learn, and fully adapt to Xabi\u2019s system.   \n  \nThis is not about hierarchy or anyone being \u201cbenched\u201d permanently. It\u2019s simply because this is a MUST WIN knockout tournament where we can\u2019t afford out of sync players.\n\n",

        "content": "I really like the way we\u2019ve played in the last two games (besides that lapse of concentration the last 10 minutes yesterday). Having Tchouameni gives us the flexibility to play a 3-5-2 with the ball and a 5-3-2 when defending. My issue is, who replaces Tchouameni if he gets an injury. I don\u2019t think we have a player that can transition from CB to CDM and back besides him and Alaba (way past his prime). I really think we need another center back with good ball retention that can adapt to CDM if needed. \n\nWhat do you guys think?",
