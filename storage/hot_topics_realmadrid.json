Of course, Nacho eventually gained enough experience to become a very fine CB, but that was after a decade learning from the best.\n\nNacho is a horribly underrated player for RM, but players like him who are able to patiently wait and them come in across the backline are generally undervalued in the football world.",

Without them, matches have become less frequent and intense, with other teams gaining prominence in Spanish football. Recent performances by both teams have been inconsistent, and off-field controversies, like the Negreira case, have added complexity to the rivalry. Although it still captivates audiences worldwide, it may take time to regain its former glory.",

        "title": "Incase you missed it. Here is Laporta's lies and contradictions at his testimony yesterday.",
        "content": "Testimony was an hour long. I gather some of the important  bits and translated them. \n\n\nRelationship with Negreira\n\nClaim: Laporta said FC Barcelona never dealt with Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Enr\u00edquez Negreira, only with his son (Javier Enr\u00edquez), who supposedly produced the reports.\n\nContradiction:\n\nFormer president Sandro Rosell testified that Negreira senior personally carried out the reports.\n\nEmails exist between Laporta and Negreira senior, contradicting the claim that they never spoke or dealt with each other.\n\n\nAdditional inconsistency:\n\nLaporta said he didn\u2019t even know Negreira senior was Vice President of the Referees\u2019 Committee, which is widely considered implausible.\n\nWho Supposedly Wrote the Reports\n\nClaim: Laporta said Negreira\u2019s son was responsible for preparing the refereeing reports.\n\nContradictions:\n\nAt the time, Negreira\u2019s son was part of Fenerbah\u00e7e\u2019s coaching staff, raising serious doubts about:\n\nHow he had the time\n\nHow he could perform detailed Bar\u00e7a-specific referee analysis\n\n\nRosell\u2019s testimony directly contradicts this, stating the father, not the son, did the work.\n\n\nExistence and Destruction of Reports\n\nClaim: Laporta said reports were routinely destroyed every five years.\n\nContradictions:\n\nLaporta later appeared at a press conference with red boxes full of reports and CDs, allegedly containing hundreds of reports.\n\nHe even displayed two specific reports from 2012, contradicting the claim of systematic destruction.\n\nHundreds of reports later \u201cappeared\u201d in storage, despite allegedly being destroyed years earlier.\n\n\nKnowledge of Payments\n\nClaim: Laporta said he never knew about the payments or their amounts, because presidents don\u2019t approve all expenses.\n\nContradictions:\n\nHe later stated that any payment over \u20ac3,000 requires board approval, contradicting his earlier claim of ignorance.\n\nHe personally justified a dramatic increase in payments, meaning he must have known about both:\n\nThe existence of the payments\n\nTheir amounts\n\nEscalation of Payments\n\nClaim: Laporta justified quadrupling the payments by saying there were \u201cmore matches and more competitions.\u201d\n\nContradiction:\n\nThis explanation requires detailed knowledge of the payments, directly contradicting his claim that he didn\u2019t know about them.\n\nThe increase (from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of euros annually) is considered grossly disproportionate to any increase in matches.\n\n\nCoaches and the Alleged Reports\n\nClaim: Laporta stated that all coaches received and used the refereeing reports.\n\nContradictions (sworn testimony):\n\nLuis Enrique:\n\n&gt; \u201cIn six years as a coach, nobody showed me a single refereeing report, neither to me nor my staff.\u201d\n\n\n\nErnesto Valverde:\n\n&gt; \u201cI was never offered nor shown any refereeing reports.\u201d\n\n\n\nThese are the primary intended recipients of such reports, making Laporta\u2019s claim untenable.\n\nSuspicious Invoices\n\nInvoice 1 \u2013 \u201cAloe Vera Gifts\u201d\n\nFC Barcelona paid \u20ac60,000 to a Negreira-linked company for an invoice labeled \u201caloe vera gift packs\u201d.\n\nNo credible explanation was provided as to how this relates to refereeing analysis.\n\n\nInvoice 2 \u2013 2010 World Cup Referee Report\n\nBar\u00e7a paid for a report analyzing referees at the 2010 World Cup before the tournament even took place.\n\nThis suggests billing for services that could not yet have been performed.\n\n\nOverall Pattern Highlighted by the Testimony\n\nRepeated use of:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know\u201d\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t my responsibility\u201d\n\n\nContradictions between:\n\nLaporta\u2019s statements\n\nDocumentary evidence (emails, invoices)\n\nTestimony from other presidents\n\nTestimony from coaches\n\n\nA central defense (\u201cthe payments were for reports\u201d) that is directly undermined by every coach who should have received them\n\n\nBottom Line\n\nLaporta simultaneously claims:\n\nHe didn\u2019t know about the payments\n\nHe justified increasing them\n\nThe reports were vital\n\nThe reports were never seen by the coaches\n\n\nThese positions cannot logically coexist.",

The team is playing dominant and dynamic football despite all the absences\n\n46' - 2nd half underway \n\n\ud83d\udfe5 64' - straight red card for Pol Fortuny - I have no clue why - it's a joke that this tournament has English referees \n\n\ud83d\udd04 66' - Mascar\u00f3 comes on for Mesonero\n\n\ud83d\udd04 69' - Lacosta comes on for Manuel \u00c1ngel, and Marcelo, who is in the stands, watches his son Enzo make his inofficial Castilla debut, coming on for goalscorer Palacios\n\n\ud83d\udd04 84' - Galassi and Almeida come on for Leiva and Cristian David - all 5 players who came on are debutants\n\n90'+5 - City score from a corner but it gets called off due to obstruction against Mestre\n\nFT - Castilla manage to hold on to the draw with one man less, but they deserved even more as they were playing a really good match before the red card and were still dangerous on the counter afterwards. The team did really well today considering 14 players are unavailable and the squad consisted mainly of RM C and Juvenil A and B players today. After the completion of their group stage, Castilla are still first in their group, but have more matches played than all the other teams - they have to wait another month or so to know if they passed, but 8 points might be just enough\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 20:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Joie Stadium, Manchester\n\n**Referee**: Will Finnie (ENG) \n\n**Competition:** U21 Premier League International Cup, Group Stage\n\n**Viewing options:** [RMTV/RM Play](https://play.realmadrid.com/live/237284)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-3-3): Sergio Mestre - Liberto Navascu\u00e9s, \u00c1lvaro Lezcano, Lamini Fati, Jes\u00fas Fortea - Cristian David (84' Paulo de Almeida), Manuel \u00c1ngel (69' Diego Lacosta), Dani Mesonero (66' Joan Mascar\u00f3) \u00c1lvaro Leiva (84' Bruno Galassi), C\u00e9sar Palacios (69' Enzo Alves), Pol Fortuny\n\nBench: Guille S\u00fanico (GK). \n\nUnavailable: Fran Gonz\u00e1lez (first team call-up), Joan Mart\u00ednez (first team call-up), Mario Rivas (Spain U19 call-up), V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as (first team call-up), Diego Aguado (Spain U19 call-up), David Jim\u00e9nez (first team call-up), Jorge Cestero (first team call-up), Thiago Pitarch (first team call-up), Roberto Mart\u00edn (injury), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Bruno Iglesias (injury), Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (Spain U19 call-up), Rachad Fettal (injured), Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga (AFCON (Ecuatorial Guinea)). \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** WLWDW\n\n**PL International Cup stats:** 1st | 7pt | 2-1-0 | 4:1\n\n",
