        "title": "The discourse around Vini has been a clusterfuck and out of everyone, I expected Madridistas to know better.",
        "content": "Do you not remember how this all started? We could go back to the 2018-20 era where a teenager moved to the biggest club in the world, from a different continent, and due to bad circumstances, was unexpectedly forced to the front line and asked to be the club\u2019s starting left-winger; I shouldn\u2019t have to explain the immense pressure of being the guy who\u2019s asked to fill Ronaldo\u2019s boots, now imagine you\u2019re 18 and you just moved from halfway around the world. Remember when we used to call him \u201cFin\u00edcius\u201d? Now look at the player he\u2019s become.\n\nBut we don\u2019t even have to go back that far. I know a Madridista\u2019s memory can be short but do you remember the slowly emerging sentiment from rival fans between 2021-23 that Vini wasn\u2019t a good sport and he was toxic? It grew and grew after every game. they\u2019d clip moments where he\u2019s showboating or arguing and our 2022 UCL win only made it worse; because now he was a superstar. Now, did he do some showboating and arguing? Yes, I won\u2019t deny that, but why the fuck are we cozying up to our rival fans and agreeing with them? They are not our friends; they want nothing but to see Real Madrid fail.\n\nNow, here\u2019s where I think the clusterfuck started: In late 2022, racist language started to rise in the away stadiums and social media; it was always there but I think this is when it started to become mainstream. This all culminated in early 2023 when the Mestalla chanted \u201cmono, mono, mono\u201d. Vini reacted. I don\u2019t want to discuss whether or not he should have done so, but I just ask that you understand why he did; that is an important distinction. To experience someone viewing you as subhuman because of something you can\u2019t change, you cannot expect a person to just \u201cignore it\u201d.\n\nSo he reacted, and then other racists realised what they could do, and then all the noise started to blend together from the 2021-23 haters who judged him on his antics and the racists who judged him on the colour of his skin, and when he complained that he \u201cjust wanted to play football\u201d, all his haters (non-racists + racists) reply with \u201cthen don\u2019t dive and argue\u201d, because both groups have the same message but where they\u2019re coming from is different, and when they all get accused of being racists for this, the non-racists get even more mad.\n\nNow about this recent development where he\u2019s arguing with our team. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever been in a team before or even in a group of friends, but shit like this HAPPENS. Tensions are high in the moment and all you and I see are what happens in public; we don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like indoors. I know it\u2019s bad optics that the person he argued with was Luka, but shit like this happens all the time. I just think it\u2019s important to take a step back and separate all of this hate towards Vini: It\u2019s all clustering together and forming into one big \u201cVini is toxic\u201d narrative.\n\nThe shit that makes my blood boil is when I hear it coming from MADRIDISTAS. Do you not remember? Do you have such a short memory? We have always had players of a \u201ctoxic\u201d variety on the pitch \u2013 Ramos, Pepe, Ronaldo, Casemiro \u2013 and it didn\u2019t matter because they were OUR PLAYERS. They would bleed for us and the least we could do is support them back.\n\nAt the very least, can someone confirm to me that I got the timeline right? There definitely used to be a disproportionate hate on Vini from 2021-23 and then when the element of racism was added into the mix, everyone just forgot all this history? Out of everyone, I\u2019d expect Madridistas to know better.",

They refer to the last statement after the Espanyol-Real Madrid, in which they questioned the professionalism of the referee, and to the continuous videos that are broadcast on Real Madrid TV criticizing alleged errors against whites.\n\nOn the other hand, different sources have congratulated the Federation for the call for this first meeting among all those involved in professional football. \"This is historic. Being able to tell the referees what we think and being able to continue working like this, in tune, is wonderful,\" says a manager of a First Division team. Among the most understanding, FC Barcelona: \"Possibly, we have done things wrong in the past, but now we want to be closer to all of you,\" said one of its managers.\u201d",

Valverde as to help Lucas, so he will be very defensive based. Tchuo I believe in his position he can stand firm. For the rest of the midfield we have belli up front, alongside a lw of rodrygo and a rw of Ibrahim. \n\nRodrygo will be going up but he will still be more back as to help take wait off mendy.\n\nSo most likely our main attacking force here would be Ibrahim and belli and kylian.\n\nI don't think I cooked but that's what I dreamt off last night. What do you think",

He\u2018s been playing terrible for like 2 months and obviously his attitude has always been ridiculous but atleast he played well? He gets a yellow card damn near every game, always creates unnecessary drama on the pitch and now even with our own teammates (eventhough the media is making the most out of the modric incident, you get the point) I can\u2018t believe im saying this as a big vini fanboy but he almost feels like a liability atm. Rodrygo has been performing much better than him, I need Vini to step up again man it hurts to see him like this. Feel like the attention he gets got to his head.",

Don't you realize this is coming from the leeches in the antimadridista media? Maybe you do and are an antimadridista yourself.\n\nIn football, things happen on the pitch, players have arguments, they can be heated, especially when the team is in a tight situation, but that stays there. Of course, the media likes conflict, it gets them clicks, and some \"journalists\" have been on a payroll to damage Real Madrid image. Why would you help them?\n\nIt baffles me how much antimadridismo we see in this sub. Isn't the purpose of this community to support the club, our team? What do you gain from spreading the hate?",

        "content": "Jacobo Ramon started yesterday and didn't have the best game, similar to how Diego Aguado (CB) started against Minera and was a bit shaky. But it's okay, they're still kids and they can only improve from these mistakes, let's not be too harsh on them.\n\nBut these two really put into perspective how good Raul Asencio has been for us. He has really been up to the task from the first second he stepped on the Bernabeu. In terms of physicallity and mentallity he seems to be ready for 1st division football. He still makes some small errors, but that's totally expected. I'd go as far as to say that he deserves to be a starter even if Alaba returns back to action soon, same for Militao in the future (if we still refuse to sign anyone else).\n\nI think Asencio - Tchouameni will be our CB partnership for the upcoming really important games, Ancelotti doesn't really have a choice to try anything else. I really hope we don't see anything too crazy like Mendy CB or something. We can only hope Rudi makes a quick comeback for the 2nd leg vs City and partner him with Asencio, we'll need both of them.",

        "content": "Full transcript:\n\nYour leave from Madrid?\n\nThat's how it is, I talked to him a lot and he told me to stay at Real Madrid. But I think my time at the club had already arrived, because it was 10 years of great demand, where I gave up a lot of time. I tried to explain to him that I could no longer be there because of the difficulties I was having at that time and he said: \"If it's for the money, man, I'll give up my money to give it to you!\". And I said no: \"Thank God it's not for that, it's for other issues\". I also wanted to feel football again, and that's it, I chose to go to Turkey.\n\nThere were eight seasons in common in Madrid. There are surely good stories to remember and some less good ones too. Eight seasons is a lot...\n\nLook, I have a moment with Cris that will never leave my memory. Despite having lost my memory, I lost a piece of this game. It was in the first game of the championship against Valencia. I received a blow from Iker [Casillas], opened my head and went to the hospital. I still entered the game [before that]. There were five minutes left, I entered after the break and, that's it, from there I don't remember anything else.\n\nI remember that when I woke up the next day at the hospital, I was still with Real Madrid equipment tied to the bed. Then, I was going to ask my family what had happened, my wife, who was five days away from having my eldest daughter, who is Angeli, and in the news I see that Cris had been there in the hospital!\n\nAnd you didn't even give it for him?\nAnd I didn't even notise him! And then, of course, my mother was there, also worried because she had come to see the birth of my daughter, my mother and my father. Cris was there practically all night with me, with my family members. Not with me, with my family, because I was in the room. But he was there, giving strength and some comments he made only demonstrate the affection we have for each other.\n\n\nDid you have an ordinary social life in Madrid? Have you ever cooked for him or did he cook?\n\n[laughs] Not that! It was easier for me to go to his house, because he invited me a lot. We went to his house, we had dinner at his house, or sometimes we went out for dinner and then we came home [laughs].\n",
