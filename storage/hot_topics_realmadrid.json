Every header, every strike, every sprint tells a story of resilience, of faith, of those who bleed white no matter the odds.\n\nSome of these players were giants in their time, some quiet dreamers who seized the moment. All of them remind us why we love this game, why we love this club.\n\nLife may throw the impossible at us, but if they can see it through to the final whistle, so can we.\n\n// 004 \\[Remontada.

        "title": "Real Madrid will file a complaint to FIFA over refereeing",
        "content": "Source: Marca\nTranslation: Google\n\nReal Madrid Television announced it at 6:50 p.m. News. Real Madrid is preparing a dossier on what happened from the refereeing perspective in these first four matchdays of La Liga and last season to send to FIFA so they can take note of what's happening in Spain. The Whites were outraged by the refereeing incident at Anoeta and decided to make public a measure they have been working on for some time. \"It's a shame we have to talk about this scandal and not about Mbapp\u00e9's great game or Tchouam\u00e9ni's 150 matches,\" they stated on RMTV, where they insisted. \"Real Madrid will present this report so that FIFA can take note.\"\n\nThe Real Madrid club ended the match against Real Sociedad outraged by Huijsen's red card, which wasn't reviewed by VAR despite Oyarzabal being on the touchline, 50 meters from goal, and Militao being level with the Malaga native. \"The fact that the referee wasn't given the chance to review it...\" the players lamented. Even Xabi Alonso, usually calm with the referees, couldn't believe it, received a yellow card for protesting, and ended up demanding an explanation from the referee. \n\nOn Real Madrid television, they're reporting on a red card report dating back to the Negreira era , stating that Bar\u00e7a's record against the Reds is +65 , while Real Madrid is at -2 . In the Champions League, the club claims, the record is +12 for Bar\u00e7a and +13 for Real Madrid. They don't understand why, in the 21st century, Bar\u00e7a has a winning record in 65 games playing with a man advantage, while Real Madrid has a winning record in two games playing with one less man.  \n\nMbapp\u00e9's disallowed goal against G\u00fcler for offside didn't raise as many eyebrows, although Real Madrid believes the VAR frame rate is detrimental to them in 90% of cases. Once again, the Frenchman's offside position was pinpoint accurate. \n\nMadrid does not change its policy\nThe Whites made it clear before the season began that they weren't happy with the changes to the CTA and that they wouldn't stop until all the referees or directors who had had contact with Negreira were removed. The war continues, and the start of the season isn't helping.\n\nBecause Madrid is no longer just denouncing the refereeing decisions it suffered, but that report will also reveal facts such as the fact that the Rayo-Bar\u00e7a match was played without VAR during certain phases of the match, coinciding, for example, with a non-existent penalty on Lamine Yamal. \n\nMadrid will take all of this to FIFA, a complaint that serves as a measure of pressure in response to what it considers \"a constant abuse\" that began with Negreira.  \n\n\n\n\n",

        "title": "How do you all feel about the RMTV stance on the referees",
        "content": "I believe RMTV is delving too much into their emotions while bringing up the topic. The facts they are pointing at definitely holds truth in itself. But the major issue is the language.\n\nStandard of refereeing is unarguably the lowest in Spain among the top 5 leagues. Even when you look at the matches between mid-table clubs, the refereeing doesn\u2019t paint any more vibrant picture. \n\nIf we are trying to achieve any end goal which involves improvement of the situation, then RMTV needs to be a bit more delicate with their wording. We are well within our rights to highlight the horrendous mistakes from the referees which have been costing us in form of player suspension, goals scored/conceded and match points. When you put it in a way only to showcase how Real Madrid is being affected by those decisions and ruining the overall quality of football in La Liga, perhaps the other clubs may feel encouraged to come out and speak up on their own behalf. But to highlight how Real Madrid is specifically being targeted, would yield the exact opposite result.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the other clubs in La Liga resent Real Madrid. Now, when you are presenting yourself as a targeted victim while being the stronger force than all of your peers, nobody is going to show empathy. And without collective support, we are not going to move a needle in this. We need to be a lot more political through our outlets. Us, Madrid fans, see things through the same lens as the club. So obviously we would all be in agreement. But what matters is bringing the others on the same page and ranting like this won\u2019t help. We won\u2019t need to invite others to join hands, we just need to present ourselves in a way that others feel encouraged to speak up for themselves and voluntarily come forward to collaborate. RMTV is doing poor execution of a noble cause.",
