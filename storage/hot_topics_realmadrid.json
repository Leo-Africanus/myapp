        "content": "It\u2019s been a day about Luka and Carlo and rightly so. They were both amazing for the club and I have limitless love to both of them. But despite how it ended, let\u2019s show some appreciation to Lucas too. A canterano who is Madridista through and through just like us. Despite his limitations, he gave it all to the club. I know this season was off but until last season, he was a brilliant understudy to Carvajal when he was injured. Switched from being winger to RB because the club needed it. Never complained about anything either. And more important of all, he has the Zidane stamp of approval- Zidane loved him! And we all know how brilliant Zidane was in his judgement of players! Farewell Lucas! We\u2019ll always have galacticos and big names because we\u2019re Real Madrid. Players like Lucas, Joselu, and Nacho are the ones I am worried about.
