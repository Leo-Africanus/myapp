Xabi has done a lot of hardwork. \nBarcelona is not looking as good as last year. Inigo's Departure and Injuries has left them vulnerable. Raphinha and Lewandowski (their best El Clasico players last year) are also not playing. \n\nLast two El Clasico, we were close, very close to winning. But it's okay, it's in the past. Only thing that matters is tomorrow. We will get the 3 points and shut all of them up.

        "content": "Barca Pres claimed a few days ago that somehow the blame falls on Real Madrid that Hansi Flick lost his head and made an obsene gesture at the ref, after complaining about the amount of extra time.\n\nSpecifically, the gesture is basically the Spanish (and European) version of the American middle finger at the ref. You tell me, does that not deserve a second yellow? But no, according to Barca Pres, he got the yellow because of Real Madrid.\n\nAnd now this little wet behind his ears punk echoes that ridiculous claim. Lamine Yamal is really showing what a petty and unattractive personality he's got. I understand he's still a teenager but he's over 18, acting like he's 14.\n\nYou got to feel sorry for these people. They even blamed Real Madrid for being discovered to have had a ref on their payroll. Can you imagine?\n\nOne thing that really annoys me is how Barca media constantly sane washes Barcelonas actions. Imagine if Real Madrid had a ref on their payroll, and they claimed it was for some reports. The media attacks would never stop. \n\nRecall when Real Madrid claimed that ref were biased following some insane decisions in 4 games in a row, what the media reaction was. Look at what they're claiming and the media's judged it as just quirky. And you tell me media isn't biased.\n\nApologies if there's a topic on this already.",

Avil\u00e9s can't ask for another challenge for the rest of this half\n\n\u26bd 25' - GOLLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - and on the other side of the pitch, pressure by Cestero leads to an early recovery from David - he moves forwards into the box, and squares it to Loren, who managed to break completely free and only has to calmly slot it into the net for a quick brace \n\n39' - almost the hattrick for Loren - Cestero intercepts a pass and puts through Loren with a great through ball - his first touch isn't great, but he can chip or over the keeper in time. A defender clears it off the line to prevent an early KO for Avil\u00e9s \n\nHT - lovely first half by Castilla against an inconsequential Real Avil\u00e9s. The team is arriving at the opposing box with ease, with Loren converting 2/3 of his opportunities to give us a comfortable lead for now. The midfield of Cestero, Manuel \u00c1ngel and Pitarch is doing a spectacular job so far, but Real Avil\u00e9s have slowly taken control closer to the end of the second half, so the team cannot relax yet \n\n46' - 2nd half underway \n\n\ud83d\udd04 63' - Diego Aguado and Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez on for Manu Serrano and Pol Fortuny\n\n64' - huge chance for Avil\u00e9s after a lobbed pass and a mistimed tackle from Joan, but their player fires the volley shot against the post from a very short distance\n\n68' - Avil\u00e9s pushing hard to get one back here \n\n74' - first good chance in quite some time for Castilla, Y\u00e1\u00f1ez cuts inside at the edge of the box, and his curled shot goes just wide low at the far post \n\n\ud83d\udd04 76' - Mesonero on for today's goalscorer Loren\n\n\ud83d\udd04 88' - Manuel \u00c1ngel and Thiago Pitarch off for Cristian David and Bruno Iglesias\n\nFT - the second half was more open, with Avil\u00e9s trying their hardest to get back into this match, but with a few exceptions, Castilla handled the pressure well and bag 3 deserved points at home. Arbeloa's team has now won 4 in a row and will finish this matchday in the promotion playoff spots\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 21:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee**: \u00c1lvaro C\u00e1novas Garc\u00eda-Villarrubia \n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 1, Matchday 9\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[LaLiga+](https://www.laligaplus.laliga.com/) (subscription - 14.99\u20ac/month) (only available in Spain)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-3-3): Fran Gonz\u00e1lez - Manu Serrano (63' Diego Aguado), V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as, Joan Mart\u00ednez, David Jim\u00e9nez - Jorge Cestero, Thiago Pitarch (88' Bruno Iglesias), Manuel \u00c1ngel (88' Cristian David) - C\u00e9sar Palacios, Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga (76' Dani Mesonero), Pol Fortuny (63' Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez)\n\nBench: Guille S\u00fanico (GK), Jes\u00fas Fortea, Mario Rivas, Lamini Fati, Gabri Castrelo. \n\nUnavailable: Sergio Mestre (first team call-up), Roberto Mart\u00edn (injury), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Rachad Fettal (injury). \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** LLWWW\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 6th | 12pt | 4-0-4 | 10:10\n",

I actually find myself avoiding visiting this place lately because of how toxic it\u2019s become (somehow even more than r/soccer, which says a lot). The amount of hate toward certain players, especially Vini, is absurd.\n\nThen there are the so called \u201ctactical analysis\u201d posts popping up daily. Things like \"why Mbappe is better as a LW\", \"why Fede should play as an RW\", etc are low-effort, repetitive, and doesn't offer any real insight.\n\nWhat\u2019s even worse is the atmosphere. The sub now seems entirely driven by player agendas, and anyone who expresses a different opinion gets instantly downvoted into oblivion.  Even though the sub didn't offer very high quality discussions it still used to feel like a space for Madristas. Now it feels like a fan community just with hot takes and echo chambers.\n\nMods, please approve this post**.** I\u2019m not trying to start drama, just sharing honest feedback from someone who\u2019s been here for a long time and really wants this sub to feel enjoyable again.\n\n",
