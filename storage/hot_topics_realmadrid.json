        "title": "Throwback to the last time Real Madrid faced PSG and Karim Benzema scored a hattrick in 17 minutes after being 0-2 down",
        "content": "When PSG were drawn against Real Madrid, everyone expected a PSG win. They had prime Mbappe, Neymar, Messi, and Di Mar\u00eda. And us? We had Karim, a developing Vinicius, Modric, and Courtois. Our squad had flaws. Kroos was struggling, Casemiro wasn\u2019t sharp, and every time the ball neared Carvajal, we panicked. All our hopes were on Courtois, Modri\u0107, Vini, and of course, Benzema, the man carrying our attack since Ronaldo's departure.\n\nBut when the scoreboard read 0\u20132 in the 60th minute, all hope seemed lost. Madrid fans were chanting Mbappe's name instead of chanting our own players. Then came the moment that changed everything: a 17-minute hat-trick from the best player in the world that night which launched a campaign of goals and elite playmaking. Everyone talks about the Manchester City game and rightfully so but this game against PSG was just as legendary.\n\nStill, the headlines from CBS with Jamie, ESPN etc focused on PSG\u2019s collapse rather than the brilliance of Benzema, who scored a knockout-stage hat-trick while losing 0\u20132 in 17 minutes. He never got the praise he deserved, not even from Madrid fans, despite a better big-game resume than Suarez or Lewa without being the focal point of attack until 2019 and never being a traditional No. 9.",

I agree that this was not the time to experiment with formation, but how is Xabi meant to prevent mistakes like acensio and rudiger made? People are forgetting how much better we played for every match before this other than maybe the first one for obvious reasons because it was his first match with the team. He hasn\u2019t been coaching them for long, and PSG is arguably the best team in the world right now and literally just won the champions league so it\u2019s expected that they will play incredibly well. \n\nXabi can try his best to improve the team but if the players keep playing like this and making lazy mistakes then there is not much he can do, he\u2019s not magic. Xabi isn\u2019t the problem the players are, which should be obvious but apparently some people think no after one bad game Xabi is a bad coach and worse than Carlo and the team is back to how they were last season. \n\nOn a positive, at least we have a bit more time before laliga",
