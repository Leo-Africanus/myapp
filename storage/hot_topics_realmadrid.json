Mbappe is in an amazing form. Midfield is looking good with Guler. Vini looks in good form. Defense is looking good, better than Barca and the most important thing, we have a good structure now. Xabi has done a lot of hardwork. \nBarcelona is not looking as good as last year. Inigo's Departure and Injuries has left them vulnerable. Raphinha and Lewandowski (their best El Clasico players last year) are also not playing. \n\nLast two El Clasico, we were close, very close to winning. But it's okay, it's in the past. Only thing that matters is tomorrow. We will get the 3 points and shut all of them up. Hala Madrid\ud83e\udd0d",

        "content": "Barca Pres claimed a few days ago that somehow the blame falls on Real Madrid that Hansi Flick lost his head and made an obsene gesture at the ref, after complaining about the amount of extra time.\n\nSpecifically, the gesture is basically the Spanish (and European) version of the American middle finger at the ref. You tell me, does that not deserve a second yellow? But no, according to Barca Pres, he got the yellow because of Real Madrid.\n\nAnd now this little wet behind his ears punk echoes that ridiculous claim. Lamine Yamal is really showing what a petty and unattractive personality he's got. I understand he's still a teenager but he's over 18, acting like he's 14.\n\nYou got to feel sorry for these people. They even blamed Real Madrid for being discovered to have had a ref on their payroll. Can you imagine?\n\nOne thing that really annoys me is how Barca media constantly sane washes Barcelonas actions. Imagine if Real Madrid had a ref on their payroll, and they claimed it was for some reports. The media attacks would never stop. \n\nRecall when Real Madrid claimed that ref were biased following some insane decisions in 4 games in a row, what the media reaction was. Look at what they're claiming and the media's judged it as just quirky. And you tell me media isn't biased.\n\nApologies if there's a topic on this already.",

I actually find myself avoiding visiting this place lately because of how toxic it\u2019s become (somehow even more than r/soccer, which says a lot). The amount of hate toward certain players, especially Vini, is absurd.\n\nThen there are the so called \u201ctactical analysis\u201d posts popping up daily. Things like \"why Mbappe is better as a LW\", \"why Fede should play as an RW\", etc are low-effort, repetitive, and doesn't offer any real insight.\n\nWhat\u2019s even worse is the atmosphere. The sub now seems entirely driven by player agendas, and anyone who expresses a different opinion gets instantly downvoted into oblivion.  Even though the sub didn't offer very high quality discussions it still used to feel like a space for Madristas. Now it feels like a fan community just with hot takes and echo chambers.\n\nMods, please approve this post**.** I\u2019m not trying to start drama, just sharing honest feedback from someone who\u2019s been here for a long time and really wants this sub to feel enjoyable again.\n\n",

Trent and Dani are back and we have stable defence, we must improve, but I think we have capacity to stop their attack. And the bonus thing is that we play at the Bernabeu with +2 points ahead of them.\n\nMy prediction is 4-2 for Madrid, Kyky x3 and Franco x1 goal. \n\nLet me hear you as well?",

        "content": "so far he\u2019s started almost every game this season, seems to be a safe bet as an undisputed starter for xabi. i get it he\u2019s young full of energy and our best pressing player of the front 3. BUT i think so far its very fair to say he has been nothing spectacular outside of that. I dont care about goals assists or stats but still he barely contributes in general (poor at taking people on, primarily left footed and even his crossed and passes with his strong foot havent been anything nearing special AND the biggest problem is in multiple game now he\u2019s our main right sided free kick taker and right sided corner kick specialist? not only have pretty every single one of his free kicks went into the stands his corner crosses have been subpar at best. i dont remember what game it was but we had 4/5 free kicks in the first half all of them he took and all wasted. guler then came in and guess what we score from a great cross from a corner. i mean come on now a first year 18 year old being one of the main specialists and hes been shit at it. now that bellingham is back and trent and carva are nearing their return, he definitely has to welcome the bench. guler bellingham and valverde are more deserving of his starting spot (not saying in that position but honestly id prefer any of three over him in his position) and the final nail in the coffin why did we even sign this seemingly subpar left footed attacked when we have a much much better one in nico paz waiting for his chance and proving how good he is. He\u2019s a good depth-rotational piece for now maybe he grows into more but he\u2019s had his chance while belli was out. It\u2019s time he hits the bench",
