But from the games I\u2019ve watched, he doesn\u2019t seem that bad. Like yeah, he\u2019s not peak Carvajal defensively, but he\u2019s not getting destroyed every week either.\n\nIs he really a huge weakness at the back? Or is it just that Liverpool\u2019s system leaves him more exposed and people fixate on every little mistake?\n\nWould love to hear what you guys think.",

        "content": "As a long time supporter of Real Madrid only situation that made me as excited about new season was that summer 2009 when Kaka, Xabi, C. Ronaldo and Benzema were signed. \n\nFlorentino Perez returned and you could feel that was a beginning, a foundation of something great after years of terrible results in CL.\n\nGranted, they didn't succeed instantly, but that was the beginning of a project that would bring us La Decima and then three peat CL.\n\nI kinda have the same feeling again with Xabi. And it's not because of the players that were brought, although they are great.\n\nIt's more the feeling that our play style will change, have more structure, more team play, cohesion, pressing and less individuality.\n\nYou can see the club is really learning on mistakes, especially with the ridiculous number of injuries. New people are brought, with new, modern training techniques to solve that issue.\n\nThey also seem to listen Xabi and don't make problems for him regarding strengthening the positions in team that were disregarded for so long.\n\nIt looks like this could be the start of a new successful era, but again so many things can go wrong (hopefully not). What do you think?",
