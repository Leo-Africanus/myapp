        "title": "Xabi Alonso delighted with Arda Guler [MARCA]",
        "content": "According to MARCA, Xabi Alonso was delighted with G\u00fcler's performance and attitude . What surprised him most was not only his already well-known quality on the ball, but also his willingness to learn automatic movements, occupy new spaces, and acquire defensive concepts that had never been part of his game. The manager was impressed by the maturity with which G\u00fcler assumed this new role and the plan is to continue developing him as a key player in creating play from midfield.\n\nFor his part, G\u00fcler also emerged from the tournament much strengthened. After months of demanding more playing time and continuity, the Turk found in Xabi Alonso a coach who believes in his talent and gives him the space he so craved. At 20 years old, Arda G\u00fcler  is preparing for a crucial season. Real Madrid is entering a new era with Xabi Alonso at the helm, and the young Turk is poised to be one of the key players. His new role as a creative midfielder not only opens a door for him in the starting lineup, but also places him at the heart of the football project of a coach who relies on talent, associative play, and tactical play.\n\nIf the sensations from the Club World Cup are confirmed, this could be Arda G\u00fcler's breakthrough season. \n\n\n",

For one that Rodrygo is going to leave the club the signs were there as early \"Don't Forget the R\" propaganda last summer/early fall. As soon as I saw Rodrygo getting benched in the CWC I knew it was over. Xabi was sending a message and it breaks my heart. \n\nThe other fact is that Rodrygo is nowhere near a move right now depsite rumors being hot all summer. Imo the best fit for him was Bayern and they overpaid for Diaz instead. Liverpool has already spent a lot and currently going for Isak. Then you got Arsenal who seems to have opted for a RW backup and other bench pieces instead of a bona fide starter at LW instead. \n\nHonestly idk how Al Hilal hasn't swooped in and even offered half or 75% of what they were offering to Real Madrid and Vini. I think the club would accept that in a heartbeat and it might turn Rodrygo's head. I mean its turning Vini's. ",

        "title": "Rodrygo Has Run Out of Options",
        "content": "Rodrygo Goes, the Brazilian winger at Real Madrid, finds himself in a complex situation regarding his professional future. Despite being highly regarded in Europe, his role at the club has been drastically reduced, with very limited participation in key matches like the Copa del Rey final and the Club World Cup final. Real Madrid is considering selling him to complete two crucial transactions in the transfer window, though no formal offers have yet been received.\n\nClubs such as Bayern Munich and Liverpool have opted for other targets, while Arsenal has not advanced beyond preliminary interest. Only Tottenham remains as a potential suitor, albeit a less prominent one. This leaves Rodrygo with few alternatives amid declining physical and emotional condition, having lost weight and confidence. The club would only entertain offers of around \u20ac100 million, which presents a significant hurdle in today\u2019s competitive market.\n\nA Market in Flux\n\nAs the global market heads toward a high-stakes finish in spending, there are still players looking for a new space to shine. Rodrygo, born in 2001 in Osasco, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, is among them  \ufffc.\n\nWhile he\u2019s on many clubs\u2019 radar, and Real Madrid hasn\u2019t yet received an official offer, the club\u2019s planning includes his departure to fund the final moves needed to complete their dream squad  \ufffc. Rodrygo played only 45 minutes in the Copa del Rey final against Barcelona in April and 92 minutes in the Club World Cup\u2014indicating how limited his game time has become  \ufffc.\n\nAlthough Rodrygo and his representatives have publicly expressed his desire to remain at Madrid, reports suggest the club views him as a transfer candidate following his substitution in the Copa del Rey final  \ufffc.\n\nPhysical and Mental Decline\n\nSince then, Rodrygo has struggled with a physical imbalance that caused him to lose nearly five kilos, as well as an emotional downturn due to his lack of effectiveness in front of goal. Even a stay in Brazil with his two children did not fully help him clear his mind  \ufffc.\n\nInterest Fading from Big Clubs\n\nDespite maintaining a strong reputation across Europe, major clubs are looking elsewhere. Bayern has decided to sign Luis D\u00edaz (for around \u20ac80 million) and Liverpool has not progressed its interest in Rodrygo. Real Madrid insists on offers close to \u20ac100 million if a sale is to happen  \ufffc.\n\nLiverpool\u2019s considerable winter spending\u2014such as Wirtz (\u20ac125M) and Ekitike (\u20ac95M)\u2014may also explain the lack of movement regarding Rodrygo  \ufffc. Meanwhile, Arsenal has already invested roughly \u20ac200 million in Zubimendi (\u20ac70M), Madueke (\u20ac56M), and Gy\u00f6keres (\u20ac75M), reducing appetite for another major forward signing  \ufffc.\n\nOnly Tottenham remains an option\u2014but it\u2019s seen as a step down compared to the other clubs. Gradually, Rodrygo is running out of viable alternatives to leave Real Madrid this summer  ",

        "content": "David Alaba has been a key figure in the squad, offering leadership, experience, and versatility at the back. But with injuries affecting his consistency and younger players stepping up, it\u2019s fair to ask whether keeping him for another season is the right move. Does he still bring enough to the pitch to justify his place? Or is it time for the club to look ahead and refresh the backline?",

Normally, teams run behind this kind of player.\n\nLiverpool was in the news, they maybe want him, but they say they need to sell Luis Diaz first. Arsenal also talk so much, they say they will pay big money, but still no real bid. PSG even, but Real Madrid says no offer came yet. Tottenham, Manchester clubs only news, no action.\n\nMaybe they all are playing waiting game until the last minute.\n\n",
