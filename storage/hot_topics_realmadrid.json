The team deserves to take the lead and needs to continue like this in the second half \n\n46' - 2nd half underway \n\n\ud83d\udd04 62' - first sub, Y\u00e1\u00f1ez on for Cristian David\n\n68' - great save by Pi\u00f1eiro who scratches the ball of the line on a header after a corner \n\n\ud83d\udd04 70' - David Ruiz for de Llanos\n\n75' - massive double chance for Castilla, after Y\u00e1\u00f1ez' shot is blocked, the ball falls for David outside of the box, but the keeper can save his shot - the ball falls to Y\u00e1\u00f1ez who plays it back to David, his cross is spectacular and Gonzalo's header towards the bottom left corner is too, but the keeper's save is even better \n\n\u26bd 84' - it's just ridiculous at this point - Castilla in full control, David Ruiz loses the ball in his own half - Elejalde's shot is deflected heavily by Edgar, and the ball goes past Pi\u00f1eiro into the net who was heading into the other corner... \n\n\ud83d\udd04 85' - last sub, Loren Zu\u00f1iga in for Yusi \n\n90'+1 - Fan culture is so shit in Spain man, Antequera away fans are non stop provoking instead of cheering on their team \n\n90'+3 - great save by Pi\u00f1eiro to deny the 1-3 \n\nFT - I'm so sick of this team at this point, another match where a win was a must both with the chances they had and the situation on the table - the team has to realise that only wins and points count at this point, or they will absolutely and inevitably get relegated \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 12:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee**: \u00c1lvaro C\u00e1novas Garc\u00eda-Villarrubia \n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 2, Matchday 13\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[FEF TV](https://feftv.com) (subscription - 12.99\u20ac/month)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (5-2-3): Diego Pi\u00f1eiro - Youssef Enr\u00edquez \u2018Yusi\u2019 (85' Loren Zu\u00f1iga), Edgar Pujol, Mario Rivas, Loren Aguado, David Jim\u00e9nez - Jos\u00e9 Maria Andr\u00e9s \u2018Chema\u2019, Cristian David (62' Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez) - Gonzalo Garc\u00eda, Hugo de Llanos (70' David Ruiz), V\u00edctor Mu\u00f1oz \n\nBench: Mario de Luis (GK), Quique Ribes, Antonio David.\n\nUnavailable: Fran Gonz\u00e1lez (Spain U21 call-up), David Cuenca (pubalgia) Pablo Ram\u00f3n (ACL tear), Ra\u00fal Asencio (?), Jacobo Ram\u00f3n (muscle injury), Manuel \u00c1ngel (muscle injury), Andr\u00e9s Campos (muscular injury), C\u00e9sar Palacios (ACL tear), Borja Alonso (muscle injury), Pol Fortuny (muscle injury). \n\nCoach: Ra\u00fal\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** DLDDW\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 16th | 12pt | 2-6-4 | 14:12\n",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI recently visited Madrid and bought a Valverde shirt as a gift from the official store at the Bernab\u00e9u. Unfortunately, it turned out to be too small. I was wondering if anyone knows if it\u2019s possible to return or exchange the shirt remotely? I live in Berlin and can\u2019t return it in person.\n\nI still have the receipt, but the official customer support hasn\u2019t been very helpful so far. Has anyone dealt with something similar or have advice on how to handle this?\n\nThanks in advance for your help!\n\n",
