Since I need to plan my trip and book place to stay as well as plane ticket, that's kind of late for me.\n\nShould I be worried about tickets availability? From what I've read, only reliable ticket providers are RM official webpage and in front of stadium, right?\n\nI'll be staying in Madrid for the weekend and I'm planning tour on stadium day before the game, probably going back home on Monday, so if you have any any other advice, what to visit, where to go, what to see, can you share with me?\n\nThanks a lot",

        "content": "First of all, let me just say: Bar\u00e7a propaganda is hard at work. Vini drops an MVP performance and somehow the conversation becomes about Raphinha\u2019s \u201cleadership qualities\u201d? Is this a joke? \ud83d\udc80\n\nBefore I rant \nTLDR; whatever you accuse vini of doing everyone else was doing. Complaing? They were having full blow argument everyone (maybe not Rodrygo I can't remember) so why this narrative on VINI ? Secondly it was the 98th minute game was basically over vini had scored. I don't why he was arguing but vini was getting fouled over and over again it was ridiculous. I'd be mad to 7 or 8 foul without a card. Lastly don't let lovers tell you attitude or class is a quality in football. Given me and example ? \"Humble\" Messi? Yh this is gaslighting. \n\nIt's honestly exhausting watching how Vin\u00edcius Jr. is treated\u2014by the media, by fans, by institutions. \n\nWe\u2019ve reached a point where no matter what Vin\u00edcius Jr. does\u2014whether he scores, assists, defends, carries the team, or simply exists\u2014the media and a large portion of football fans twist the narrative against him. The double standards are exhausting, and frankly, they\u2019re rooted in thinly veiled racism.\n\n\nThe amount of hate and \"criticism\" he receives on a regular basis is beyond disproportionate. And let's be real: it\u2019s not about his football. It never was. \n\nHe's called arrogant for celebrating, provocative for standing up for himself, and dramatic for reacting to racism. The message is clear: he's not hated for what he does\u2014he's hated for who he is.\n\nMeanwhile, there are footballers who have committed actual crimes\u2014rape, assault, even manslaughter\u2014and somehow they still get less hate. They're still celebrated, still protected. Racist footballers? Still employed, still praised. Drug users? Rehabilitated and welcomed back like heroes. But Vini dances after a goal, shows emotion, or defends himself against literal racial abuse, and suddenly he\u2019s the problem?\n\nDani Alves was convicted of sexual assault. Didn\u2019t receive half the vitriol Vini gets just for dancing.\n\nSu\u00e1rez\u2019s violent and racist past was rewritten as \u201cfiery competitiveness.\u201d\n\nRonaldinho, Rib\u00e9ry,  pique, robinho (gang rape) etc.\n\nI won't list more crimes of footballers as the point isn't to smear people names just giving yall perspective.\n\nNewmar used to fight fans amongst other things, Messi chokes players and cheat on a regular.\n thank God for var. \"Hand of god\" \n\nAs much as I love Ronaldo he was a princess in Madrid (maybe that why I loved him more lol). I.e he complained alot as he should.\n\nNone of you all half half as much criticism for any other these players.\n\n\nYou can\u2019t convince me this isn\u2019t rooted in racism. It\u2019s so thinly veiled, it might as well be naked.\n\nAnd the worst part? So many people just accept this treatment as normal. They try to gaslight him\u2014and everyone else\u2014into thinking it\u2019s all in his head, or that he\u2019s \u201cplaying the victim.\u201d No. He is the victim, and it\u2019s happening in broad daylight, week after week.\n\nIt\u2019s clear. Vin\u00edcius is held to a completely different standard\u2014and that standard is racialized, institutional, and intentional. He is not treated like a footballer. He is treated like a threat\u2014for being proud, Black, Brazilian, and brilliant.\n\nPerhaps you didn\u2019t actually watch the match\u2014understandable, it was hard to sit through. The game stopped every five minutes because players were constantly arguing. Vini was getting fouled repeatedly 7 or 8 times by my count, and somehow the Colombian players didn\u2019t even pick up a single yellow. A few of those challenges easily warranted a red. The whole match was chaotic\u2014everyone was arguing. Let\u2019s not pretend Vini was the only one reacting.\n\nThey always try to make it seem like only vini would do this. No they were all arguing everyone. Vini was actually calm till he was get fouled over and over again. \n\nHow did vini score the last goal ? Someone fouled him right before his goal. \n\n\nEnough is enough. Start naming the real issue.\n\nThis reminds me of miles Lewis smelly for England also being hated for being black confident and english.\n\n\nAll I can say is the propaganda is strong. Even now they are trying to say vini is selfish for the goal he scored. Madridista please don't fall for this propaganda.\n\nNewmar is a horrible person by all accounts yet this propaganda is still strong \nDespite this long list, Neymar was still largely celebrated and treated like a superstar. The tone was always: \u201cflawed genius\u201d, \u201cbad boy with talent\u201d, or \u201cemotional but brilliant\u201d\u2014not the dehumanizing, racially charged vitriol Vin\u00edcius Jr. faces just for dancing or speaking out.\n\nWe've seen this before Mario Balotelli even eto.\n\nSamuel Eto\u2019o faced racism multiple times, even threatened to walk off the pitch. Yet when he reacted, it was seen as controversial or \u201cover the top.\u201d\n\nYou Don\u2019t Hate Rapists, Gamblers, or Murderers This Much\u2014But Vini\u2019s the Problem?\u201d\n",

Gonzalo and Victor played almost all of these matches (I believe that Victor missed a couple, but Gonzalo played all), but we're still not scoring enough. Three of the aforementioned draws have been goalless.\nWith the form that was there before this stretch of games, it looked like we'd surely reach promotion spots, given the point difference wasn't much either. It doesn't seem that certain anymore.\nDoes anyone have any insights?",
