A day that I will have marked in my calendar for life.\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cI am very happy to be here, in what I feel is my home. My bond with Madridismo has never ceased to exist and, since I entered Valdebebas an hour and a half ago, that feeling has been reborn.\n\n&gt; \u201cI have the feeling that this is the beginning of a new era. Florentino, thank you very much for the confidence. I feel that the fans, the Madridistas, are excited to start this new era, to grow and to make the history of this club greater. Thanks also to my family, who are always with me\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cBefore I start talking about the new phase, I don\u2019t want to stop talking about the phase that has come to an end. Carlo was my coach, a great person and a great influence. Without his mastery, I would probably not be here. I take over and I take up his legacy with a lot of honour and a lot of pride. I hope I can live up to the expectations and take the club to all the places where we all believe we can do it.\n\n&gt; \u201cWe are starting a period in which I feel that the club and the fans are united. We have a great team, we have fantastic players and very good potential. That gives me reason to come here with a lot of energy and enthusiasm. We have the conviction that we can achieve important things, worthy of Real Madrid and these European Cups.\n\n&gt; \u201cWe want the fans to be proud, that we transmit emotions, joy. We want people to go to the stadium to enjoy themselves. If we manage to ignite that, we will have an unstoppable force. We are convinced that we can do great things, thank you very much.\n\n&gt; \u201cThank you very much, Hala Madrid!\u201d",

I hope he plays great for us and I hope he's appreciated by the Bernabeu faithful. \n\nHe would have Carvajal competing for RB position as well which would be interesting to see. \n\nALREADY LOVE TRENT \u2764\ufe0f",

However, his deep understanding of the club and its values could play a key role in navigating the early challenges. On top of that, Florentino P\u00e9rez is reportedly very keen on making Madrid the first club to win the new-format Club World Cup, which could add extra motivation. With that kind of backing and ambition, anything\u2019s possible\u2014even in a transitional phase.\n",
