        "content": "\"There have been some unforgettable years that I'll carry dearly close to my heart,\"\n\"Football, like life itself, is full of adventures that begin but eventually have to end. I always knew that one day it would come to an end my time here at Real.\n\n\"It has been a wonderful period which is coming to an end. A great time. But if even life comes to an end, imagine what it's like when a period with a football team comes to an end.\n\n\"I've enjoyed it, and I want to finish it well. And then, on the 26th, I'll talk about another challenge.\"\n\nThe fact Real have yet to officially announce Ancelotti's departure was raised by reporters but he played it down and said everything was done in accordance with all the parts involved.\n\n\"Real will issue a statement when they think adequate, but there is no problem or issue between all parts whatsoever,\" Ancelotti said.\n\"I never had problems with Real and never will have problems with Real. It's a club that lives dearly in my heart, but everything in life has a date to end.\"\n\n\"I am very fond of (Alonso). I don't have any advice for him because he has all the tools to be a great coach in the future,\" Ancelotti said of a player he coached at Real during his first spell in charge.\n\n\"The day I arrived, if someone had told me I would win 11 titles in four years, I would have signed (for) it in blood. This season hasn't gone well for many reasons. But it has been an unforgettable period.\n\n\"I couldn't be Madrid coach for the rest of my life. It comes to an end for many reasons. The club may need a new impetus. I'm not making a big deal out of it.\n\"A thousand thanks to this club. And we'll carry on. I'll always be a Madrid fan. It's the end of an era. Spectacular. I never thought I'd coach Madrid for six years, and now it's happened.\"",

Vasquez played like a champ when he was in his prime, gave his all for the club and never complained about managerial decisions against his favour. Now when he is not in his prime anymore and playing out of position we have no right to shit on him. We are better than that. Yes, they have made crucial mistakes that cost us recently but like I said, we do not judge a player or a manager on their worst performances. We have had great seasons in the past and this season has been a reality check for us. Which we take on the chin and move forward as always. We will comeback stronger than ever and we do not need these plastic fans tainting our player\u2019s and our manager\u2019s legacy. \nHala Madrid!",
