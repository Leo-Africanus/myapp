Bellingham being the top goalscorer and assister for madrid while being the pots in laliga with 3 g/a in the euros and 40+ throughout the whole season. And carva being the most decorated and complete player in the entire world that season. That is to this day the most disrespectful ballon d'or campaign i've ever witnessed. No disrespet to vini but him being 2nd in the 2024 ballon do'r race is the exact same as yamal ending 2nd in 2025.\n\nAbsolutely embarrassing of an award that year If carva didn't win it jude should be the no.1 choice, idk why our fanbase was pushing for vini, im guessing its the attacker pr. An absolute joke and disrespect to jude and carva imo.",

        "content": "After tearing his LCL twice in the 23/24 season, he entered a high-pressure contract year and decided to play through the pain to win the Prem and secure his free transfer to madrid. And now we pay the consequences because by not fully recovering, his thighs and ankles had to overcompensate for that unstable knee, which completely wrecked them leading him to be sidelined for 106 days and missed 23 games so far. And now with the world cup coming up and him wanting a spot he wants to return as soon as possible. I'm hoping that Madrid is forcing him to keep recovering which was causing the rumors that he wanted out of the club, so he can force himself to play. It's best that he fully recovers or else we'll be paying him 30 million euros including bonuses for 6 years. With endrick on loan leaving a spot open, a transfer would be a dream, but it's not happening unless after the Ben\u00e9fica Madrid game 3 days before the transfer deadline, Mourinho leaves and joins Madrid where he then makes a midfielder or defender signing. But that's crazy talk.",

        "content": "   One of the biggest flaws of the team, even after so much success, has been the performance in the league. It is surprising how much Madrid struggles in the domestic competitions compared to the champions league. We drop points in games that should be easy, and it seems we lack endurance over a whole year. It got to the point where even Xavi managed to win a league over us. Which if you ask me, we should have won it. I obviously prefer winning a CL than the league. But why does Madrid struggle so much domestically?",
