        "title": "Take a BOW Eduardo Camavinga",
        "content": "Nobody seems to be talking about it because of Asencio's hilarious moment, Belligol, and the birthday boy having a great day, but Eduardo Camavinga is so special and deserves his flowers. I had preached that Tchouameni was not offensively good enough for this midfield and that Eduardo Camavinga should replace him, but this subreddit lynched me. They told me that Camavinga does not have the frame or physicality. There was also the Kroos-archetype obsessed group that said \"We need Zubimendi, a player like Kroos is the only way to win soccer games!!!!\". A lot of people even said that Camavinga is better suited to play left back. I am so glad that you are all proven wrong now!\n\nThis kid does everything. Every defensive action that you could ask for, he can do it. He has SOOOO much dog in him. His dribbling is so elite for the position that he plays, it feels almost Brazilian. He plays nothing but progressive passes. He plays deadly split passes. He is such a fearless player. Today against Mallorca, he was spectacular. This is honestly a Camavinga appreciation post. I think we should sign a midfielder if Modric decides to call it a career, but we dont need to sign any type of player that will command a large amount of minutes. Also I think that Tchouameni is better suited to CB than CDM, so the Militao injury was kindof a blessing in disguise. Without that injury, we would likely still have Tchouameni in the midfield and Camavinga on the bench. Cheers!",

        "content": "Haven't said this enough but fuck this commentary on vini. I was with vini even at valencia. Cantona kicked a fan, keane killed someone's career, messi has grabbed someone by the neck, so has ronaldo.  Not that I am condoning any of these but I'd legit be happy for once if he just kicks or punches someone, at least a valid ban. I'm tired of people saying \" oh no someone's provoking vini so vini should try to be better\". We only look at him as a footballer... It's insane to think that he gets racially called names and ugly at his literal workplace. No money justifies that. I'm sure if ramos and pepe were here maffeo wouldn't have a headline. \n\nThe last thing he needs is his own fans telling him to grow up. He'll learn the Masters of dark arts with time but until then FUCK all fanbases and especially commentetors. Yesterday a few times Mc manaman did point out the stupidity of maffeo but honestly the idea of \"vini should just ignore\" is insane to me. If it was gavi doing the same or rodri spain would be dickriding. The reason why I've addressed this is our fan base is somewhat going against vini without even knowing it. Prime example is Sergio El capitano. Was he provocative? Yes. Was he called monkey!? No was he called ugly and stupid? No. Come to think of it he was always a nuisance in Clasicos . I hardly heard the commentators or our fans to assign a psychological testing for the legend. We loved his shithousery and We need to fucking back my boi vini through the mud. ",
