The way Madrid beat Bayern (someone will say that it was with help of refs, but Bayern literally scored goal from offside and had one soft penalty) and especially how dominant these wins against Atletico and Juventus were is outstanding. It was one of the most deserved Champions League victories. And bonus question, can you order Champions League trophies from your favourite to \"less favourite\"? I will say Cardiff 2017; London 2024; Milano 2016; Kyiv 2018; Paris 2022 (I didn't watch football in 2014). ",

        "title": "Why the Bellingham criticism makes no sense",
        "content": "I'm seeing more and more comments in recent match threads criticizing and even hating Bellingham, especially for being selfish and looking to score goals. I'll explain very clearly why this criticism is completely, utterly retarded.\n\nFirst, we literally have three left wingers and zero presence in the box. Last season we had Joselu, now we have nobody who makes those type of runs. God bless Fran Garcia because there have been so many times this season where he gets himself into a good position on the touchline and whips the ball in, just to see it sail to the other side because not a single attacker is in the box. If Bellingham isn't crashing the box, then pretty much no one is. That makes our attack extremely predictable. \n\nSecond, the front three still have very little chemistry when playing together, particularly Vini and Mbappe. Every time Mbappe plays well, Vini has a stinker. Every time Vini plays well, Mbappe has a stinker. I do feel a little bad for Rodrygo because he's basically forced to play on the right. Bellingham is the one player who links up well with all 3 attackers. He's the connective tissue. If you play him deeper, the front 3 will revert back to what we saw earlier in the season, which was frankly dogshit. \n\nFinally, the game has evolved. The traditional 10 no longer exists, the likes of Riquelme, Guti, even James Rodriguez are of a past era. We're entering an age where the 10 needs to be all-action: creating, scoring, and defending. If you can't accept that, then stick to watching highlights of the 90s. \n\nIf you want to criticize Bellingham for being a little selfish at times, fine by me. Every world-class player has selfish moments. But first understand his role in this team before shitting on him. ",
