Joselu... who would bother putting this on the starting lineup when they play FIFA on PS5 ? Mbapp\u00e9 is sexier, Vini is faster, Rodrygo is better.\n\nBut I swear to god, with Gonzalo Garcia in the box... I remembered how pathetic we looked for the entire last season with the midgets 'pretending' to go for the cross. Mbapp\u00e9 and Vini have no headers... Rodrygo is a 'smidge' better... Bellingham is decent... but he is no classic number 9... and again he is a midfielder.\n\nLook at sometimes how 'simple' Football can be. You don't need all those fucking 'tactics'. A cross, the ball in the air.. it becomes a battle of height and who bullies who more in the match up in the air. Defenders last season, if they park the bus, have nothing to be afraid of in the air unless it's a corner kick and Rudiger or Tchouameni are there.\n\nVini ? Mbapp\u00e9 ? They don't even jump to clear a cross.. they do it so casually... no pressure at all... \n\nNow look at what Gonzalo, the no name, is doing. \n\nLet this be a lesson.",

Arda will be crucial this season, he\u2019s settling nicely in that CM role looking solid! Dean is a beast. Gonzalo wow!! Stunning to see Fede do his thing in person.

        "content": "When watching these last few games Rudi has played, it does not seem that he is 100%. I know he just came back from the meniscus surgery, but he seems to be at like 70%. Does anyone else feel the same/concerned he might injure something else at this point in his career? Hopefully, he is fine as he has been great for us. ",
