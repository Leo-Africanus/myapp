And you may even call me hurt, but I believe a big part of why we lost was luck. I mean, when did Declan rice do that before? It\u2019s like he did that specifically to beat Madrid. He is a great player, but that was pretty much a one time thing. It is just like a curse I feel we have to break. ",

        "content": "I can\u2019t imagine a more perfect image of Real Madrid and Zidane than this one. This is perfection.\n\nFirst, let's start with the kit. Plain white, not stained by any sponsor (sorry I am a purist), retro look with collars for our centenary year, full sleeve- absolutely timeless. Love it. Then, the stage itself. it is the champions league final- the competition that best defines us as a club like no other. We'll never be satisfied even if we win 20 more than everyone else.\n\nNext, the man who scored this- Zizou. The marquee signing, the highest transfer in the world at this moment. The fact that he would later return as manager and lead us to glory makes it all the more poetic that he was the one to score this goal. The love and gratitude he has shown fopr the club over the years is immense.\n\nAnd finally, the goal itself. Roberto Carlos sends a hopeful cross at the edge of the box. The ball rises into the night so high up, hangs impossibly long, and begins to fall behind Zidane. Zizou waits- still, patient and calm just like the person he is. No defender rushes, no challenge comes. It is as though time itself has paused for him and he knows it. Then\u2014one perfect swing of his weaker foot no less and the contact is so well timed. Bam. Golazooo.\n\nDimitar Berbatov later said he got the perfect view of the goal and he just wanted to clap even though he was playing for the opposition team. And really, can you blame him? Who wouldn't?\n\nThank you Zizou, you are a gem. So thankful that Florentino passed that napkin to Zizou in the UCL awards function with the message of Real Madrid interest and Zizou said yes without a second thought.",
