        "content": "Some key insights:\n\n**Yellow cards per number of fouls committed:**\n\n* Barcelona picked up a yellow card for every 10.2 fouls committed. This is the highest Fouls per YC received in la liga so far. Valencia and Alaves close seconds\n* Real Oviedo picks up a yellow card for every 4.5 fouls. Girona is close behind with 4.7\n* Real Madrid picks up a yellow card for every 6.57\n* Average for La Liga is 6.8\n\n  \n**Yellow cards drawn per times fouled:**\n\n* Barcelona oppositions receive a yellow card for every 3.87 fouls on Barcelona players. This is the lowest. Alaves is second with 4.47\n* Real Madrid oppositions receive a yellow card for every 16 fouls on Real Madrid players. This is BY FAR the highest number of fouls before a yellow card is shown. Sevilla is second with 12.67\n* Average for La Liga is 7.4\n\n  \nData source: [https://www.thestatsdontlie.com/football/europe/spain/la-liga](https://www.thestatsdontlie.com/football/europe/spain/la-liga)\n\nI never used it before but I checked some random teams and data seems accurate. I got from there the number of fouls and YC\n\nFun fact there have been 1266 fouls in 5 matchdays\n\nCompiled the rest using good old Excel :D\n\nI will run the same exercise on Premiere League and see how it looks like.",
