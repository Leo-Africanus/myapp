        "content": "#FT: JUVENIL A 5:2 OM\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#UEFA YOUTH LEAGUE \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:**\n\n1:0 Thiago Pitarch 17'\n\n1:1 Mohamed Baradji 25'\n\n2:1 Anis Doubal (own goal) 27'\n\n2:2 Tadjidine Mmadi (penalty) 42'\n\n3:2 Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (penalty) 53'\n\n4:2 Diego Mart\u00ednez 'Beto' 80'\n\n5:2 Adri P\u00e9rez 90'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - kickoff, vamos! \n\n\u26bd 17' - GOLLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - Arnu steals the ball from their defensive midfielder, and quickly plays it to Thiago at the edge of the box. He takes a few quick touches to create space, and then cuts his shot across, low into the far corner\n\n\u26bd 25' - goal for OM - Illia punches away a free kick poorly, then their player takes a shot and it hits the post - the ball bounces to Baradji, who takes a little touch, and Joan Mart\u00ednez can't clear it off the line in time (and even then it would've bounced back into the net again), what a crazy and unfortunate goal\n\n\u26bd 27' - GOLLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - and right in the next attack, Fortea advances on the right wing - his powerful and low cross gets deflected into the near corner by Marseille's Doubal! \n\n42' - penalty for OM after a foul by Rivas \n\n\u26bd 42' - Mmadi converts\n\nHT - half time in a very open match where most dangerous situations ended up being goals on both ends - the goals we conceded were entirely avoidable, and the team needs to pay special attention to defending set-pieces better or preventing them from happening in the first place\n\n46' - 2nd half underway \n\n51' - penalty for Juvenil A after Y\u00e1\u00f1ez gets tripped in the box! \n\n\u26bd 53' - GOLLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - Y\u00e1\u00f1ez takes it himself and converts! \n\n\ud83d\udd04 59' - Rivas and Cestero off for Valde and Beto \n\n\ud83d\udd04 71' - Y\u00e1\u00f1ez off for Gabri Valero\n\n\u26bd 80' - GOLLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - golazo de Beto! free kick from around 20 metres out, and Diego Mart\u00ednez strikes it right into the top corner on the goalkeeper's side of the goal! \n\n\ud83d\udd04 83' - last subs, Ciria and Arnu off for Adri P\u00e9rez and Jacobo\n\n\u26bd 90' - GOLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - and the cherry on top, after a dribble by Gabri Valero, he crosses the ball low into the box - it gets deflected towards the far post by the defender, where Adri appears to head it into the net\n\nFT - a calm and controlled second half by the team makes the match end with a comfortable scoreline - they had OM under control defensively much more than in the first half and pounced in the decisive moments in attack. We will get to know the opponents in the Round of 16 and the possible path through the rest of the tournament on Friday\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 16:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee:** Sam Barrott (ENG) \n\n**Competition:** UEFA Youth League, Round of 32\n\n**Viewing options:** [RMTV/RM PLAY](https://play.realmadrid.com/home)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Juvenil A XI (4-3-3):** Illia Voloshyn - Diego Aguado, Mario Rivas (59' Victor Valdepe\u00f1as 'Valde'), Joan Mart\u00ednez, Jes\u00fas Fortea - Jorge Cestero (Diego Mart\u00ednez 'Beto'), Carlos D\u00edez, Thiago Pitarch - Alexis Ciria (83' Adri P\u00e9rez), Adri\u00e1n Arnuncio \u2018Arnu\u2019 (83'' Jacobo Ortega), Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (71' Gabri Valero)\n\nBench: \u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez (GK), Melvin Ukpeigbe, \u00c1lvaro Lezcano, Pol Dur\u00e1n. \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro L\u00f3pez\n",

        "content": "\u201cReal Madrid\u2019s decline over the last 18 months goes beyond tactics or a manager. It\u2019s not one player that is the issue. It\u2019s not one bad transfer window. It\u2019s a variety of different reasons and some of the cultural issues at board level weigh heavy. \n\nI can\u2019t help but think about the \u201cdelayed bill\u201d from a squad building model that looked ideal even just a few years ago. \n\nThe Youth Transfer Policy was a resounding success but has now become part of the current decline.\n\nThe youth policy or \u201cBaby Galacticos\u201d optimized for talent + resale. The board went with the \u201ccream rises to the top\u201d philosophy but never cut out duplicative roles and skill sets. Forcing managers to put round pegs in square holes.\n\nJoselu is one example. A journeyman who played at seven different clubs in Spain, England, and Germany before finally returning to his dream club. That journey gave him perspective. He knew his role and knew what he could provide to the team. He didn\u2019t take the RM chance for granted. \n\nLuka Modric, another example. Would he be signed today given the new policy? 27-years-old from a Premier League club for big money yet not a commercial super star? The policy would have rejected the most decorated player in RM history.\n\nElite talent isn\u2019t enough. You still need veterans with perspective, role players who accept limits and know their limits. Many within the squad aren\u2019t as good as we thought they were. The reality is some hard decisions need to be made this summer. They may not be good decisions from a commercial perspective, but the right decisions from a sporting perspective. This is salvageable. The model can still work but it needs to be less stringent and open to different profiles: technical profiles, age curves, role expectations, etc.\u201d\n\nThought this was a really good piece that sums up our problem perfectly and would give the full article a read if you have the time.",

He has all the tools to be a great defensive midfielder: he has an insane motor, he can tackle, he can shoot from far, he can pass, he can dribble... I don't know why he hasn't become the player we all envisioned. Is it because he likes partying? Is it because he's injury prone? I really hope that for our sake he turns it around. I do think that he has a very high ceiling as a player, but the floor is pretty abysmal.  At this point I'm open to the team selling him, but he's the one player I'm most scared of losing because he has shown flashes of greatness and it would suck for him to become a world class player for another team after all the opportunities he had here.

        "content": "It is clear that there are certain players. Vini, Mbappe, Jude, and Valverde that will get to play 90 minutes no matter what. \n\nThat leaves 6 slots in the outfield. \n\nWhen Trent and Carva are back. It means that Valverde will have to move back to midfield. This means that one of Tchoumeni or Arda Guler will be dropped. \n\nI feel that his approach to please the main players will eventually backfire by upsetting the others.\n\nSo far since Arbeloa joined, he has been very rigid with his XI and rotations.  \n\n",

Essentially what I'm asking is, would you like to see 7/8 min videos breaking down team performance, important moments, tactical mistakes and so forth? \n\nThere will be no player ratings or favouritism shown toward any players. It'll be strictly objective analysis. How many of you guys would like to see something like this? If you would, please let me know what you'd like to see and express your interest in general. \n\nI'm asking because it'll take me around 2/3 hours of editing, but it'll be good for the sub (at least I think so). \n\nI can start out with Benfica Vs Real. \n\nLet me know folks. \n\nHala Madrid!",
