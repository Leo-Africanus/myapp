I had a debate with my barca friend where he kept on teasing me with the current clasico result to which i replied with that\u2019s the only trophy you\u2019ll be celebrating this year.. to which he replied you won\u2019t understand what it is to support an actual team as you support real madrid and you are a glory hunter..\n\n\nSo my exact question is.. What actually is a glory hunter..? Like aren\u2019t Barca the second most successful team in spanish football.. Don\u2019t they have 4th joint most ucls .? Why is supporting Madrid considered as being a glory hunter but supporting barca or any other huge european club is not .?\n\nFor context i have been a madridista since 2010.. And i have seen most of the embarrassing defeats in el clasicos.. but never have i ever even considered calling someone a specific name for supporting a club .. and it\u2019s not just barca fans.. the entirety of the football fans consider us as \u201cGLORY HUNTERS\u201d it is quite funny lol.. but i guess that\u2019s what you get for being the best ",

        "content": "With Kroos we were able to quickly switch sides when pressed on one flank, but now we just pass it back to the goalie. I have seen Rudiger attempt long passes to Mbappe which have been effective at points, but he doesn't have the quality to make it a pass that the team can rely on. This usually forces Valverde and Jude deep which kills our attack. Tchouameni in a Kroos position is what is needed with Cama in that holding position to open up that space and Valverde and Jude pressing up top to link with the attackers. This past few games I have noticed that Modric and Ceballos seem to have the opposite effect on this team, instead of playing quick attacks trying to spread the field, they rather play it safe and slow. And the safety is only momentarily because once they lose it up field they have to run back once the press is broken, while when Kroos launches long balls, if they lose it he is already in a defensive position. This is why our team has no fluidity and tires out much earlier than other years. Just look at Barca being more aggressive with long balls. ",

David Jim\u00e9nez fails to close him down in time, deflects the shot and makes it unsaveable for Fran\n\nHT - Castilla 2-0 down at half time despite being the slightly better team for most of the half. The team had trouble breaking through the last line of Murcia's defense and got punished in the back for lapses in concentration\n\n\ud83d\udd04 46' - 2nd half underway - Loren Aguado comes on for Antonio \n\n\u26bd 52' - GOLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - corner from the right to the near post where Loren Aguado flicks it on to the far post. Quique Ribes is free and manages to slide it into the net from a tight angle to pull one back for the team\n\n\u26bd 61' - goal for Murcia - what a mess, long throw for Murcia that directly leads to a goal - misunderstanding by Rivas and Fran Gonz\u00e1lez and Juan Carlos Real can poke it past Fran in the chaos to make it 3:1 and probably seal the game \n\n\ud83d\udd04 62' - Manuel \u00c1ngel is back for a 2nd time this season, hopefully this time he doesn't reinjure himself again - he comes on for David Ruiz. Also Y\u00e1\u00f1ez is on for Pol Fortuny\n\n\ud83d\udd04 70' - de Llanos on for Gonzalo, who is called up with the first team \n\n73' - de Llanos' shot from just inside the box hits the outside of the post \n\n80' - big chance for V\u00edctor as the ball drops for him on the volley, but his shot is straight at the keeper \n\n88' - almost the 4:1 but their player misses an open net\n\nFT - more would've been possible in this match, but the team conceded very silly and preventable goals and didn't have the urgency and determination to break through Murcia's defense.

        "content": "I've been seeing a discussion on here and social media in general about our lack of creativity and chance creation, which is driving me insane. \n\nFor some reason, a lot of people have this image of creative players as these lazy geniuses who walk around the pitch for 90% of the match and then threads a through ball that goes past 5 defenders into the path of a striker who's just standing there smoking a cigar and puts it in the back of the net. \n\nThe reality is chance creation has just as much to do with the forwards as the creative midfielders. Go watch Ozil's highlights at Madrid, he made a lot of amazing passes, but those passes would never have existed if Ronaldo didn't make the right runs. That doesn't take away from Ozil's brilliance, but it highlights that chance creation is a two-way street. Btw, Ronaldo is still the best player I've ever seen of making runs into the box. \n\nThis is where Mbappe fails to deliver. He either runs offsides (almost about to break a record) or doesn't make any runs at all. There was a moment in the Liverpool match, where Brahim was looking to make a through ball to Mbappe, but he had to delay the pass because Mbappe was standing offside, resulting in us losing possession. That happens way too often. Meanwhile, Rodrygo has a tendency of asking for ball to feet a lot. Vini is the only forward who actually tries to make constant runs behind the defense and has elite movement. \n\nTldr: If our forwards, apart from Vini, don't improve their off-ball runs, we can have Wirtz, Bellingham, Musiala, and Palmer all playing together in the 10 and still create very little ",

        "content": "He has been way beyond terrible for almost all the 20 games he has played here, even more so against stronger sides... Now I don't buy this 'finished' argument cz last season he had 52 goals + 21 assists, the highest goal scorer that season and the highest goal scorer in champions league too with 5 goals in knockout stages. In euros he wasn't at his best but I can discount that due to his nose injury which surely affect his overall gameplay. Even against spain in the semifinal he got a brilliant cross for kolo muani to open the scoring for their team. Had france won the euros, I would be sure that mbappe was gonna win this year's ballon d'or.\n\nThe second argument is that he is mentally exhausted which seems more realistic... Like we have seen his capability to handle pressure on the biggest stages. In all the three penalties against Emi Martinez (the best penalty saver after yashin for me), I had no doubt that he was gonna score all three of 'em the moment he walked to the penalty box by just looking at his confidence. But here he can't even score penalties in league games. He seems so under-confident even in his run-up.\n\nAlso I don't buy this argument that he only performed in farmer's league cz I have seen what he does in world cup (14 g+a in 14 games) and champions league (76 g+a in 78 games).... and his record in knockout stage is even better (9 g+a in 8 wc knockout games) and (28 g+a in 28 ucl knockout games). He is also the highest wc knockout goal scorer and 6th highest ucl knockout goal scorer with only 4 pens in total in both of them. And the only time we faced him in champions league he almost f\\*cked us over with 2 great goals.\n\nSo he has surely performed in past and this has to be something of a mental block... What do you think about the reason of his terrible performance??\n\nEdit: Also I don't wanna defend this shitty performance from Mbappe. He is getting paid for his job and definitely has the top level psychologists and therapists out there to help him out... He needs to way better!!!",

        "content": "He has lost 50% of his pace in the past 12-18 months. I don\u2019t know how that\u2019s possible considering his age and that he\u2019s never had a serious injury, but he\u2019s so slow now. He can\u2019t beat any fullback for pace, he can\u2019t dribble past anyone, can\u2019t cross, his legs honestly seem like they\u2019re completely gone. That\u2019s why we always see him cut inside everytime he\u2019s on the left wing instead of knock it past the fullback and beat them for pace, I don\u2019t think he even has the confidence in his pace to beat defenders anymore. \n\nHe physically seems similar to Ronaldo after his knee injury in 2014, except he hasn\u2019t got the finishing, penalty box skills, or heading that Ronaldo possesses which lengthened his career for a long time. Mbapp\u00e9 relied heavily on his speed, and now it\u2019s all dried up, he\u2019s like a statue on the pitch. It\u2019s so sad to see a player that less than 2 years ago was absolutely destroying defenders with incredible pace, and now can\u2019t even outpace a single defender.\n\nIt begs the question of how has his physical abilities dropped so much at the young age of 25? He\u2019s always trained everyday, he\u2019s never had a serious injury, he\u2019s not incredibly overweight, so it makes zero sense that he seems so incredibly washed up at 25. The only other cases I can think that were similar was Michael Owen and R9, although they both had serious injuries which explain their drops in performances. I can\u2019t say the same for Mbapp\u00e9.\n\nAll the footage of him I\u2019ve seen with the ball boys, other players and staff has shown me he seems like a really good guy, which makes me really want him to do well. So it\u2019s devastating when you see a player with his reputation have their level drop so much, especially when he was expected to be the best player of the new generation. \n\nHonestly, maybe he needs to go to Saudi and earn a lot of money before clubs start to realise how much he has declined. Madrid could turn a massive profit from him, and he could earn hundreds of millions, it\u2019s sad, but it would probably be best for both parties.",

Mbappe is so glued to side line of left wing. Losing ball, and later fran/Bellingham winning and feeding mbappe and the story continues.\n\n- Subbing ceballos off when he was clearly better ball playing and guiding our CB's than not taking off tchoumeni for Modric\n\n- Subbing endrick and Arda at \"87\"th minute\n\n-mbappe stinking yet walking around, no press, nothing still kept him on for whole time.\n\n- Bellingham not taking penalty despite being under pressure of playing away and 1-0 down.\n\n- Starting Lucas as RCB despite him struggling to keep up. \n\n- Brought mendiddy when we needed goal\n\nCarlo is so big name pleaser guy. Bellingham and Vinicus with crew bailed him last season, got exposed a season before that by 4-0 cause Benzema got injured, and in first season, Benzema bailed his ass out with help of Vinicius.\n\nWhat's next?
