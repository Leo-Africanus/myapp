        "content": "Considering we were out by the quarters and missed out on about 3 games while Joao Neves for example made the final, this is actually really really impressive for Camavinga and Jude, pretty sure Jude also won the most ground duels in the whole thing, and he and Camavinga were some of our leaders for ground covered. Nuno Mendes is also a baller. But can someone explain why no one in our team makes ball recoveries, it's not a defensive or work rate issue clearly, maybe tactics cause they're just picking up loose balls but why are even our hardest workers just average at them?",

The Madrid coach had this to say:* ***\"We're starting a new era and we have to prioritise what's important: what we want to be, how we want to play and how we want to feel it. We want to be able to do that right from the start, starting with the match against Al Hilal. First, we have to recognise ourselves.\u201d***  \n  \n***First encounters with the players***  \n***\"They've been very positive. You gradually get to know them, you have that much-needed contact and more players are gradually coming in.\"***  \n  \n***Preparation ahead of the Club World Cup opener***  \n***\"Everything has to be accelerated because we have very little time to get to know each other and to train. We arrived here and today\u00a0Lunin,\u00a0Vini Jr. and\u00a0Arda\u00a0are arriving. We'll start to build a team and we have three training sessions before the match. We\u2019ve come with plenty of desire to have a good tournament and to go all the way.\"***\n\n\\-Official Real Madrid statement",
