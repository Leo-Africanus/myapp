Yes our forwards don\u2019t press that much but things will always change \n\nYes we don\u2019t play beautiful football like psg or Barca or whatever but we never did anyways and we won 6 ucls in 11 years so idk what the fuss is about \n\nThings will click in over time . He did win the golden boot and the pichichi. So that\u2019s one for starting. \n\nWe have a new manager , a new right back and a new center back. We are having our new era.

It is a forward-biased award, but outside the forwards he has been the best. An absolute rock in defence, great ball carrying and crossing, and even scoring in key matches. He was even the best player in that World Cup semifinalist Moroccan team. The man is class from every angle and would have locked down our back line for a decade.

How do you explain that? What were the keys to winning this European Cup?\n\n\"One of the keys was tactics, from the quarter-finals right through to the final. We changed a few things. We tried to strengthen our full-backs, to give Michel Salgado and Roberto Carlos more freedom, so we played with three experienced central defenders. Then we had a midfielder in front, a player like Fernando Redondo, who needed to be on his own, to handle and control the ball.\n\n\"In the end, we adapted perfectly to the players we had. We gave Raul freedom... In short, I think we were lucky to have a good group and we gradually led them towards a common goal, trying to move them in the right direction so that we became a team.\"",

        "content": "This is regarding the Arnold transfer. \n\nI get it that you're mad as a Liverpool fan. I would be too but the \"arguments\" these people use are terrible.\n\nThey're acting like Liverpool is a title winning mashine when they won 2 league titles in 30 years. As if we're not more succesful, historically and currently. One bad season doesn't change that.\n\nYou can also compare the squads and you'll quickly see who has the better view for the future. Obviously you won't be able to tell the future but a squad with Vinicius, Mbappe, Bellingham etc. are bound to win many titles. \n\nActing like TAA's move doesn't make sense is just so stupid to me.",

His desire has always been to stay. Jes\u00fas Fortea\u2019s horizon is clearing up, it\u2019s starting to happen, it was never cloudy, because the player\u2019s desire has always been, and still is, to keep wearing white, to extend the contract that ties him to the club until 2026, but the meeting, that first contact, hadn\u2019t taken place, until now. In recent days, there\u2019s been a move closer between the white club and the 18-year-old right-back, to lay the groundwork for a renewal that, now yes, is in the making.",
