This is a generational talent and yet he's on the bench for brahim diaz\ud83d\ude02. I'm sorry but alonso's a liar, he talked about having rotations and a hierarchy yet he watched brahim and franco offer absolutely nothing for the past 6 months and still didn't give endrick a chance, not even once. This is genuinely one of the dumbest things I've ever witnessed at this club",

        "content": "First of all, I'm not saying this to \"hate\" on the kid. I think he is a talented youngster and he has the potential to be a great player. He had some good performances earlier in the season as well.\n\nThe problem is that his skillset isn't suitable for the RW position. He doesn't have the extreme pace and 1v1 dribbling required to be a touchline winger like Vini and he certainly doesn't have the shooting boots to be your typical inverted winger. He is yet another creative attacking midfielder, yet another player in our squad who can, on paper, play RW, but he isn't an actual RW (like Rodrygo, Arda, Endrick, Valverde etc). \n\nHis best position is AM, a position covered by a 22 year and a 20 year old. And soon, maybe buy another 21 year old, who happens to be a top 3 player in Serie A. There's a huge debate in our fanbase if two of them can co-exist in the same line-up, so all four of them being in the same squad makes no sense imo.\n\nTo make the analogy, our current squad compared to 16/17 feels like having no Kroos/Modric, 2 Casemiros, 2-3 Kovacics and 3-4 Iscos (in terms of style, not quality). \n\nThe club knew that Jude was still gonna play games as an AM, that Arda will develop and that Nico Paz had a great season and he might return sooner or later, so I struggle to see how buying Mastantuono for 50m suits our squad, even long-term?\n\n* Either our scouting department sucks and they assumed Franco actually has RW qualities and they never saw him play\n* OR our board sucks and we just bought yet another expensive South American teenager, just to block other teams from buying him (why didn't we buy Estevao then? Much more suitable to our squad).\n\nIn any case: good prospect, bad transfer, in terms of useability to our squad.\n\nAgain, I'm NOT saying Franco is a bad player or that he doesn't have the potential to be amazing in the future. I just don't see the point of buying our... 4th U-22 AM for 50m when we desperately need defenders and a deep lying playmaker. It seems like some of our transfers just happen, without any sort of planning. No team has succeeded with 3 LWs, 4 AMs and 5 physical midfielders.",

Among French players, only Just Fontaine in 1958 (66 goals) scored more goals in a single calendar year for a top-five-league club and the national team than Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s 65. His 58 goals for Real Madrid put him just one goal behind Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s club record of 59 goals set in 2013. According to the schedule, Real Madrid will host Sevilla on December 21, giving Mbapp\u00e9 his final chance in 2025 to break Cristiano\u2019s legendary calendar-year club scoring record. Can he do it? How historic would it be if he does?",

The team has to work, yes, there are aspects to improve, obviously, but compare the results of other teams: Barcelona struggled to score against Guadalajara, Atl\u00e9tico drew 3-2, Villarreal, third in the league, lost to Racing, and many teams have been eliminated from the first division. I can understand the frustration, but it seems like they only started watching soccer yesterday. The first round of the Copa del Rey is like that, and it's the game of a lifetime for smaller clubs. We shouldn't overreact. Real Madrid has a lot of work to do, yes, but they're not going to sell the whole team because they conceded two goals in the round of 32 of the Copa del Rey, thanks Lunin por saving us, there is a great gap to be improved. \n\n",

Of course, Nacho eventually gained enough experience to become a very fine CB, but that was after a decade learning from the best.\n\nNacho is a horribly underrated player for RM, but players like him who are able to patiently wait and them come in across the backline are generally undervalued in the football world.",

        "content": "SOURCE (FULL DOCUMENTARY): https://youtu.be/-mMNac3IApw\nThe iconic Spanish football rivalry has lost its edge due to the departure of its superstars, who elevated the clash between the two giants to unprecedented heights. Without them, matches have become less frequent and intense, with other teams gaining prominence in Spanish football. Recent performances by both teams have been inconsistent, and off-field controversies, like the Negreira case, have added complexity to the rivalry. Although it still captivates audiences worldwide, it may take time to regain its former glory.",
