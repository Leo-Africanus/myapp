        "content": "So this is Bilbao, the best defense in La Liga that conceded the less goals. It's clear that they came here for a point. They didn't counter but just parked the bus with all of their players, which is more horrible than even Atletico Madrid's haram football. And it's not their C team or D team, I took a look in their formations in La Liga and they do rotate a lot in defense, but still barely concede.\n\nSo our team was shit during the entire season, I know that and fully agree. 2nd half was actually very good and we completely dominated and had all kinds of opportunities, from the right flank ( Valverde's shot ), left flank ( Vini constantly ), from a cross ( Jude's header ), from a fast counter ( Cama ) and lots, but we were unlucky and bad with the finishing. And the fucking ref did a tremendous job in breaking our rhythm with that offside review that should be called from the VAR room.\n\nIf we were a bit more clinical in finishing today, we could have won 3-0, we played a very good second half. Subs were correct, Ceballos still not fit and Endrick was pulling defenders with him, Brahim caused the goal and Arda did good, even LV almost assisted Bellingham but sadly he missed. Endrick was unlucky with his foot slightly been offside to cost Vinicius a goal.\n\nYet people here are like 'as usual, individual brilliance, we have no tactics'. And I'm seeing random screenshots of 'where is our midfield' that are supposed to be proof that we were ass.. well we were NOT, NOT in this game. YES we have been ass for the full season but NOT for the 2nd half of this game !\n\nJust stop it. Y'all getting what you want. Ancelotti is leaving in the end of the season. Celebrate all you want, be happy. But if your team plays well, which what this sub has been asking for months, shut up or celebrate and don't downgrade it.",

The way you command the midfield with fire in your heart and thunder in your boots\u2014it takes my breath away every time. Your fierce tackles, your rocket of a shot, that tireless engine that never quits\u2026 you are poetry in motion.\n\nI would do anything for you, mi halc\u00f3n. Sometimes I wish I could freeze time so I'd never have to witness the day you hang up your boots. You\u2019ve been through so much, but you never let it break you. You rose from humble beginnings to become the heartbeat of Real Madrid. Off the pitch, you\u2019re a beautiful soul\u2014a devoted partner, a loving father\u2014and sometimes, I even catch myself calling you \u201cdad.\u201d\n\nThe thought of one day watching you leave the Bernab\u00e9u fills me with dread. I would trade my own happiness if it meant I could see you smile just one more time after a thunderbolt goal or a clutch tackle in the dying minutes of a Cl\u00e1sico. You've brought me joy, you've brought me tears, but above all, you\u2019ve given me pride.\n\nI remember when you chased down Morata in the Supercopa, and sacrificed yourself for the badge. It was in that moment I knew\u2014you weren\u2019t just a player. You were ours. And then, your goal against City\u2026 my heart stopped. Time froze. You were him.\n\nNow you\u2019re growing into a legend, but still that same humble warrior we first fell in love with. You've changed football, you've changed me. I love you, my pookie bear, my glorious hawk, Federico Valverde.\n",
