        "content": "Hi from Madrid.\n\nAs I see that some words and some terms are used incorrectly, I am going to write a small glossary of terms and clarifications about words related to Real Madrid and f\u00fatbol in general. It is a point of view from Spain, which I am not saying is the only correct one.\n\nEl Capit\u00e1n = Captain, I often see people write El Capitano, which is incorrect, Capitano is an Italian word.\n\nEl Cl\u00e1sico = The classic, people usually uses the incorrect El Classico, again an italian word.\n\nLos merengues not El Merengue. It is used to refer to the players and fans but not for the club. Thats why is \"Los\" instead \"El\". I usually read it in Latin media but never in Spain. In a derogatory way, \"mereng\u00f3n\" is sometimes used to talk about the most die-hard fans.\n\nEl Madrid not El Real. In Spain \"El Real\" is very little used. In fact it sounds very strange. I know that it is common outside of Spain and that some chants and tifos use it but it is rare in day to day speaking. Real Madrid is El Madrid. El Real can be confused with other clubs that also have a royal title such as La Real Sociedad (La Real) or Real Betis (El Betis). Atletico de Madrid is usually shortened to El Atleti and Athletic Club de Bilbao uses its full name, Athletic Club, saying El Bilbao can be considered offensive.\n\nVikingos. The vikings. I see little use of Los Vikingos outside of Spain. It is a common term to talk about Real Madrid fans and team. It comes from the fact that Real Madrid is the terror of Europe just as the Vikings were in their time. Some fan clubs use names relative to this, like basketball Berserkers, and some tifos are inspired in this topic.\n\nIndios. Indians as native americans. Term referring to Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid fans. It comes from a joke that said they were like Indians because their old stadium was near the river and their former president (Jes\u00fas Gil) was Sitting Bull. Atleti's mascot \"Indi\" is a raccoon dressed as a native american. Also \"Colchoneros\" (Mattress makers) is used for Atleti fans, it comes from the red and white stripes in old mattresses.\n\nBar\u00e7a is short for the football club and Barna is short for the city. Is a common mistake to mix both terms, I have seen some one write Espanyol de Bar\u00e7a (there is nothing more insulting for an Espanyol fan!)\n\nPichichi = Top scorer. It is a trophy given by the newspaper Marca to the top scorer in La Liga It is named after the nickname of a legendary Athletic Club player from the early 20th century.\n\nZamora = same as above but for best goalie.\n\nIf you find any other term missing you are free to contribute\n\nEdit: added the term \"Colchoneros\"\n\n",

        "content": "I'll start by saying I'm convinced, as many people here, Ancelotti's cycle is coming to an end. His decisions are not brining the results they were brining in the last 3 seasons, and some players need a boost (Arda, Asencio, Endrick, even Nico Paz) that they won't get with Carlo.\n\nI understand why he does what he does, he values experience a lot, even if that means going against the popular opinion or the sudden good performances of youngsters. Yes, it can be exasperating because he's really stubborn, but he's been successful, more than any other coach in our history, and more than most coaches in Europe. For example, when coaching Milan, in the UCL final, Inzaghi had had a bad few games and a young Gilardino was in top form; Ancelotti trusted his instinct and Inzaghi scored twice for Milan's victory.\n\nTwo seasons ago and in the beginning of last season, people wanted to get rid of Kroos, but Ancelotti was stubborn and bet on him; we know how that played out. This season he has put Modric in before Arda, and he has delivered.\n\nThis is why he does it and why he'll continue to do it. I don't expect him to change. I am all for criticism, for pointing out what went wrong, but this sub is out of control every single game, no matter the score or how we play. Even against Manchester City there were people complaining or saying it was expected with the level of Pep's team.\n\nEvery game, there are people saying Vini is shit, that we need to sell him, or that Endrick is better than Rodrygo or Mbapp\u00e9 when they don't score. Tchouameni receives hate, no matter how he performs. In the match threads you start seeing comments like \"another game the team playing shit\", or saying this or that player is horrible, during the first 10 minutes. And if we have a bad game like against Betis, people just lose their minds and talk about how they knew this would happen since 3 years ago (but forget/dismiss all the trophies we've had these past seasons), or say Florentino P\u00e9rez is a terrible president.\n\nI think a lot of fans out there are either too young or too spoiled to realize what we have accomplished under Ancelotti is more than many teams have accomplished in their whole history, and he's done it with what could be considered a transition team.\n\nAgain, I'm not against criticizing, but please be civil and respectful. There's no need to trash everyone in the club for one bad season.",

I actually think I\u2019m gonna cry when I get there. A bit dramatic, but that\u2019s a real possibility hahaha.\n\nGot my silver VIP ticket already. But I\u2019m watching ALONE since my friend isn\u2019t a fan and would rather explore the city than watch the game with me hahaha. so any tips for a female fan who will be watching the game alone? \u263a\ufe0f\n\nAlso, the weather forecast isn\u2019t looking good for next Sunday. Do they allow foldable umbrellas inside the stadium? \n\nThanks. ",

I\u2019ve wanted to buy the Mbapp\u00e9 kit for a while now, but I recently came across this 2016/2017 Cardiff final kit with Ronaldo on the back. For me this kit would have absolute priority over Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s kit, as much as I love him. \n\nI was wondering if anyone based on these few pictures the seller gave could determine whether the kit is the real deal or just a very good replica? \n\nThank you in advance!

These past like 4 months he's regressed so much with his decision making and just overall product. He had such a good start to the season aswell, and its so disappointing  to see where he is now. He's mentally been out of the game since the year started. I wanted to compare this to last season where for the first half of the season he was just not it, but then 2nd half he was on fire. Honestly, Vinis changed in how he plays. When he finally started shining, he looked unstoppable. He was genuinely a threat everytime he was on the ball as you could just feel something was gonna happen either a goal or a chance created. Now, it just feels like he's trying to prove something in the wrong way. I don't feel that hype whenever I see him on the ball nowadays because it's almost always resulting in a throw in. I've seen people say its because of the 7 shirt, because of the ballon dor, because of the refs, etc. I just don't know whats gotten into him now, and then mix that with the referee  issues and it gets way worse. I pray this is something that will blow past, but someone needs to talk to him because its really unacceptable, specially for his standards.",
