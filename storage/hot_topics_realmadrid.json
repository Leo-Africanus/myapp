        "content": "Yes, Ancelotti\u2019s tactics have been outdated, and his decisions questionable. Yes, players like Lucas V\u00e1zquez and Vallejo continue to fall short of the level required. But these are just symptoms of a deeper, long-standing problem.\n\nThe real blame lies with Florentino P\u00e9rez and the board\u2019s gross mismanagement of the squad for YEARS. For four consecutive seasons, it\u2019s been painfully obvious that we lack depth and quality in both central and lateral defense. Injuries, form drops, and age have exposed us again and again\u2014and what does the board do? They chase strikers.\n\nStrikers. Every. Single. Window.\n\nInstead of reinforcing the spine of the team, we\u2019re flooded with attacking options while our backline crumbles. Lucas V\u00e1zquez shouldn\u2019t be a go-to right back. Vallejo shouldn\u2019t be in a Real Madrid squad. But they are\u2014not because of Ancelotti, but because the club\u2019s sporting project has been mediocre at best.\n\nAncelotti is not blameless\u2014he\u2019s stuck in the past tactically, and his choices have cost us games\u2014but let\u2019s not fool ourselves. He\u2019s the scapegoat for a structurally flawed squad built by a board that refuses to prioritize balance and sustainability over star power and headlines.\n\nFlorentino P\u00e9rez gets the praise when things go right. He must take the fall when things go wrong.\n",

We\u2019ve had a horrible year not only winning nothing but losing 3 trophies by directly losing to our rivals in the most embarrassing way.\n\nThen of course not making it to the Semis in the UCL because we got absolutely cooked by a team that turns out wasn\u2019t even that good. We got beat by them so convincingly we somehow made them look like the UCL favorites.\n\nNot only did we win nothing, we played horrible football. The defense is all over the place and while yes we have a lot of injuries it\u2019s not like we\u2019re playing random kids from the streets of Madrid in the back 4, these guys get payed to play the game and performances like this are not acceptable at any top level of football let alone Real Madrid standards. Our attack can have great games but then again let down by the defense while they also miss a lot of chances by over thinking or not thinking enough. \n\nAs much as I love and appreciate Don Carlo he clearly doesn\u2019t have suitable tactics AND/OR the players don\u2019t listen to him and however way it is it\u2019s not a good look. Looks like we\u2019re getting Xabi next season which will be interesting given how different Leverkusen are as a team specially regarding formation.\n\nIn conclusion the team played way below Real Madrid standards, we are allowed to be frustrated over this without comparing ourselves to other teams like Arsenal that won nothing but \u201chad their best season in a while\u201d, we don\u2019t have the same standards and that\u2019s okay.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for change next season and go back to our winning ways.",

As a Madridista It  sucks loosing two Finals and La Liga to your rival and leaving UCL the way we did, It happened before and it\u2019ll happen again maybe\u2026 We survived 2015, 2019, 2021, 2023 but this one is kinda hard to accept. Now it\u2019s all in the past, let\u2019s focus on what\u2019s coming. With La liga being 99% over and with the only hope to save the season now being the Club World cup next month i hope that\u2019ll Be Carlo\u2019s last title with Real and end his carrier with Madrid as a coach in good note and win it for the very first time in it\u2019s new format, and focus on the next season with Alonso, \u00a1Hasta el final! \u00a1Vamos Real!",

No matter who we\u2019ve played this season\u2014we\u2019ve looked second-best in all 4 games against them.\n\nToday, Barca didn\u2019t play some incredible football; they just pressed with intensity, and we completely collapsed in the middle of the pitch.\n\nWe're always chasing, sliding, barely touching the ball, while their midfield controls everything. It\u2019s not just about individual quality\u2014they control the tempo, dictate the flow, and we look lost.\n\nI even saw Barella look solid against them in just 2 matches. So why can\u2019t our midfield do the same in 4? Tactics? Mentality? Either way, until we fix that, nothing else matters.",

        "content": "I\u2019m 100% certain La Fabrica has loads of untapped potential. I get having flashy transfers every now and then, even signing some when their contracts expire, but pumping talent from La Fabrica would be more than the cherry on top. \n\nLegend Carvajal hailed from La Fabrica, but didn\u2019t get to start for the squad and then transferred to Leverkusen. It was only then that after an initial season of success, he was bought back and given playing time. \n\nThe punchline is that La Fabrica talent should be scouted more often, and that they shouldn\u2019t have to transfer out of Madrid to prove themselves, or be finally brought to the first team when primary options are unavailable (Raul Asencio) ",
