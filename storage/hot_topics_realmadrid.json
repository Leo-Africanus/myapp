A potential foul afterwards in the box is challenged for review by Arbeloa\n\n90'+2 - after a very long review, the ref decides no penalty\n\n\ud83d\udfe5 90'+6 - second yellow for Lamini who makes a stupid and unnecessary tactical foul while already on a yellow \n\nFT - a decent second half is too little after league leaders Tenerife had already decided the match in the first. A 1-3 loss against what is clearly the best team in the division is normally no shame, but with now 4 losses in a row and multiple players missing the next weeks due to the U20 World Cup + Fettal injured and Lamini now suspended, the situation is looking extremely dire and hopeless for Arbeloa's team.

Mind you this is a club that was once feared in the entire football world for scoring from crosses with the likes of CR7, Ramos, Big Benz, etc. \n\nThis makes our attack so pathetically one-dimensional it\u2019s hilarious. You got fans in this sub who think we\u2019re going to win the league/CL by just having Guler spam a million through balls to Mbappe. Even Barcelona who has never been known for crossing the ball a lot, have an aerial threat in Lewandowski, and Raphinha is decent at scoring from crosses. \n\nOh, one more thing, can we sack our set piece coach asap? Atletico could have scored 3 goals from corners yesterday. Meanwhile, all our set pieces were absolute dogshit. ",

I saw some people talking about benching or maybe even selling players like fede and jude and rodrygo. Jude came back from injury, yeah it was a bad decision for him to start, but we know the quality he brings to the team, he's a maestro on the ball, let's just give him some time to get adjusted again, and fede?? Holy, criticism is completely fair but this sub is filled with reactionary fans, what would happen to you if you supported your local team where they barely win anything.   \nI swear I'll lose my mind if I see another post on why some player should be benched or sold or that he's shit or doesn't fit the system, from what we know of xabi, he's not reluctant to change the system, he'll adapt with the players he has, you just gotta trust in him",

        "title": "The Never Ending Mbappe Problem",
        "content": "The Atl\u00e9tico match marked Xabi\u2019s first loss of the season (excluding the Club World Cup).\nThis defeat made the issues in both our attack and defense painfully clear. One area of particular concern is our attack, which has noticeably declined since Mbapp\u00e9 joined the squad.\n\nTo be clear, Mbapp\u00e9 is an exceptional player and is giving his all on the pitch. However, the problem is more tactical in nature, specifically, the challenge of integrating both Mbapp\u00e9 and Vini into the same starting XI.\n\nIf you analyze our matches over the past year, it becomes evident that we\u2019re doing very little in the most critical attacking area: Zone 14, the space just outside the opponent's penalty box. This zone is where elite attacking teams create their most dangerous chances, yet we\u2019re almost completely ineffective there. The root of the issue is that we aren\u2019t playing a true number 9. A traditional striker would occupy two defenders, make penetrating runs into the six-yard box, and thereby open up Zone 14 for attacking midfielders like Bellingham or G\u00fcler to exploit.\n\nCurrently, Mbapp\u00e9 is being deployed centrally, but as the game progresses, both he and Vini drift to the left. Even when Mbapp\u00e9 stays central, he tends to wait outside the box for cutbacks rather than making runs that disrupt defensive lines. As a result, no one is stretching the defense, and our attack becomes one-dimensional, predictable and easier to contain.\n\nUntil Mastantuono joined, the right wing was virtually non-existent. While he brings much-needed dynamism, he still needs a central player to link up with. A true striker holding a central position would allow for quick combinations, making us a threat from all three channels: left, right, and center.\n\nThese issues could potentially be addressed by starting Gonzalo, who appears to be the best option available for the number 9 role. However, the club continues to prioritize fitting both Vini and Mbapp\u00e9 into the lineup, a combination that, so far, has not yielded the desired balance. This setup may suffice against second-tier teams, but the moment we face sides with strong structure and intensity, we struggle significantly.\n\nLet\u2019s hope Xabi can recalibrate after this setback. \ud83e\udd1e",

Xabi himself said a few days ago that we need to be less predictable, but when it came to the match nothing really changed.\n\nAt Leverkusen, one thing I loved about him was how balanced the attack was. Around 33% down the left and through the center and  on the right. Here with us it\u2019s always the same pattern everything goes through the left, we were successful in previous matches when doing this but we can leave the center empty, and the right side barely exists. Opponents know exactly what\u2019s coming.\n\nIn previous matches, when Mastantuono was starting, we actually had some balance because the kid gave us a real threat on the right. But taking that option away made us repeat the same mistake from last season. Rushing Bellingham back and sacrificing the RW just made things worse and honestly felt like a rookie mistake.\n\nThen came the bad luck too. No Trent, and Carvajal\u2019s injury took away the last bit of threat we had on the right. With both out, we were way too one-dimensional.\n\nIt's good this happened this early, We\u2019ll bounce back. Xabi learns fast, and he will fix these mistakes.\n\nHala Madrid.",

        "content": "Took a while to process the loss and I really had to try to not let it affect my whole weekend. In saying this, I fully blame the loss on Alonso because its obvious the team selection was dog shit and rushing back Bellingham even though we all are happy he's recovered from surgery but playing him in a match of that caliber was a huge mistake.\n\nI think what made it even more shocking was that Alonso has played in these derbies as a player and he should have 1000 percent know the type of intensity that simeone and Atletico were coming with and it seems he underestimated this and paid for it but ultimately defeats like this are totally unacceptable. If we had lost 3-2 it would have been a sad loss but an understandable one but a Madrid team should never lose any match against any team by more than a 2 goal margin. I don't care how good the team is, if we need to play Mourinho type football to get the win of stop the bleeding then the player should fucking do that.\n\nAlso why have we collectively as a club decided that Ceballos cannot be a regular for madrid, there seems to be this idea going on that he's not madrid quality but funnily enough I don't remember him ever playing and us losing by a huge margin and if places on the team are truly based on merit then he should be playing and deserves a chance to prove and cement his place in the starting lineup just like any other expensive signing.\n\nOverall, these humiliating defeats need to stop, losing is a part of the game that we can accept but losing 4 nil and 5-2 like this is just not acceptable for a club of this standard and we as a fanbase should not accept it because its a slippery slope.",

        "content": "For the rest of this season, our pieces on the field should be tailored to build on Guler\u2019s strengths AND Weaknesses. Other players have had enough chance to make their marks in the mid, but what he\u2019s shown with the limited time he\u2019s had, has given him a head up to be our maestro. We have the pieces now to hide his defensive weaknesses and also to complement his strengths on offense. Xabi will have to make the call and get everyone on board sooner than later. Think early Messi or KDB. Passing geniuses who needed defensive help around them to keep their pocket open. He can have similar impact on the game if given the chance to control.  ",

        "content": "Not the result we wanted, but honestly, I don\u2019t think this is the end of the world. Yes, we got humbled, but I can actually see some positives and lessons for the future. Here are my thoughts on where Xabi slipped up:\n\n1. **Jude starting** \u2013 Should\u2019ve been used as a super sub. His impact off the bench could\u2019ve flipped the game.\n2. **Arda being subbed off** \u2013 Huge mistake. The kid is our main playmaker, and pulling him killed our creative spark.\n3. **Aerial weakness** \u2013 With R\u00fcdiger out, we had no presence in the air. Against Atleti, that\u2019s a recipe for disaster.\n4. **Vini vs Rodrygo** \u2013 Rodrygo\u2019s scoring record against Atleti speaks for itself. He should\u2019ve replaced Vini.\n5. **Inexperience** \u2013 Dean, Carreras and others still don\u2019t fully grasp the intensity and tactical grind of a derby. It showed.\n\nBut here\u2019s the silver lining: this loss might be the best thing for us. The players won\u2019t get carried away with confidence, and it gives them a reason to dig deeper, fight harder, and sharpen up before Barca. Better to take this lesson now than be exposed later.\n\nThe future still looks exciting. We\u2019ve got a young core, a coach who\u2019s learning, and a squad that will only get better from here.",

        "content": "I'm sorry is I offend people, but in my book, everyone saying \"this is one loss in september\" \"one loss is nothing\" \"I as a more smarter person than all of you have moved on so should you\" are dull and should not support Real Madrid. \n\nWe are the club that booed Casillas, CR7, KB9 and many others. THIS is the level of standards set for the club. \n\nLosing is part of the game of course. Taking the L against a team that outsmarted our team is quite normal and is frequently seen all around the world. \n\nBut losing EVERY SINGLE IMPORTANT MATCH, and by quite the margin seems to be normal and part of the process.. How can people think like that ? What process is that ? We, as supporters, are the ones to set the bar for standards. If losing by 5 in a derby normal, then we became supporters of a dull club. I am once again sorry, but we are not Dortmund Barca or Manchester United. We are a rich club, with large resources and an unbelievable squad. \n\nLosing by 5 in september is better than losing by 5 in March, this I can agree on. But losing by 5 and moving on is not a good state of mind. We, the club the coaches and the players should reflect more on what happened. This loss was not an accident, this loss was STUPID. I think everyone here can agree that upon seeing the midfield we were all like oh ow, jude fede and tchoua ? Arda on the right ? hmmm\n\nSo please, if you think that people ranting on this sub about the loss are crazy, think about it once again. \n\n  \n \n\n\n\n",

Right now, there\u2019s a lot of talent in the squad, but I don\u2019t see anyone truly leading. It feels like eleven great players who don\u2019t really know how to work together or who to look to in tough moments.\n\nMaybe with time they\u2019ll grow into those roles, but for the next couple of years, I don\u2019t see us winning anything major or competing with Europe\u2019s best. The sooner we accept that and manage our expectations, the easier it\u2019ll be for us as fans :)",

Look at how bad atleti wanted to beat us, and yet our players looked like they couldn't care less if we got hit 10-0. Observe how barca's mentality changed and how easy it is for them to make comebacks from being 2 or 3 goals down, we used to be like that as well but now it's not looking so good. I hope alonso could fix it because getting hammered 5-2 wouldn't be as bad if the players actually looked like they cared about anything",
