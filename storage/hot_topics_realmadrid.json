Bellingham being the top goalscorer and assister for madrid while being the pots in laliga with 3 g/a in the euros and 40+ throughout the whole season. And carva being the most decorated and complete player in the entire world that season. That is to this day the most disrespectful ballon d'or campaign i've ever witnessed. No disrespet to vini but him being 2nd in the 2024 ballon do'r race is the exact same as yamal ending 2nd in 2025.\n\nAbsolutely embarrassing of an award that year If carva didn't win it jude should be the no.1 choice, idk why our fanbase was pushing for vini, im guessing its the attacker pr. An absolute joke and disrespect to jude and carva imo.",

And now we pay the consequences because by not fully recovering, his thighs and ankles had to overcompensate for that unstable knee, which completely wrecked them leading him to be sidelined for 106 days and missed 23 games so far. And now with the world cup coming up and him wanting a spot he wants to return as soon as possible. I'm hoping that Madrid is forcing him to keep recovering which was causing the rumors that he wanted out of the club, so he can force himself to play. It's best that he fully recovers or else we'll be paying him 30 million euros including bonuses for 6 years. With endrick on loan leaving a spot open, a transfer would be a dream, but it's not happening unless after the Ben\u00e9fica Madrid game 3 days before the transfer deadline, Mourinho leaves and joins Madrid where he then makes a midfielder or defender signing. But that's crazy talk.",

It was an absolute beauty.\n\nFinally that fk against barca in the 2025 supercup final. I know it wasn't that important because  of how the game turned out, but oh my god that was amazing to watch. even tho i knew we were losing that game, him scoring that made me believe for a second that we're coming back.\n\nI really think we don't give him the deserved support for that, hopefully he'll play more and eventually do more aswell.
