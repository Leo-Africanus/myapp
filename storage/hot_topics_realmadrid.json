It's away so it's gonna be tough with their hostile fans for sure but we can beat them. I believe in our boys.\n\nJuve is not in a very good form at the moment with all those draws (just like last season). A good team for sure but very prone to conceding a lot of goals... if our defence is on point that night, we'll win by a good goal difference.\n\nBarcelona... not gonna talk about it, don't want to jinx anything with them. They're dangerous.\n\nWhat do YOU think though?",

        "content": "I'm an Inter fan and I'm seeing Luka Modric playing 90 minutes against Napoli making his usual genial performance.  \nOfc I've always loved his play-style, his capacity to control the game just like a true Maestro, his long-rage passes (often with trivela) which sent the attackers to goal and many other things and when I saw Madrid was getting rid of him I was truly shocked: he still could have been a super-sub for Madrid, a Maestro who can break the game with a champion's play and the fact he went to AC Milan pissed me so much because I already knew he wasn't gonna play just 10 mins per match.\n\nAnd I was right, he plays all matches as a starter, he plays more than 70 minutes and in the big match, as I said, he played a full-match. He's shining like he's a 25 y/o player in his prime (obviously he's different because he's 40 and he can't really run as fast as before).  \nWith all this stuff said I'm asking you: why did Madrid let him go? Did they think he was washed? How has he really played last year? Thanks.",

Round of 16 vs. PSG: Down 1-0 from the first leg and 2-0 on aggregate early in the second, the tie seemed over. Then, Karim Benzema ignited the Bernab\u00e9u. He scored a stunning second-half hat-trick in 17 minutes to flip the script for a 3-2 aggregate win, eliminating Messi, Mbapp\u00e9, and Neymar.\u00a0 \n\u2022 Quarter-Finals vs. Chelsea: Following a Benzema hat-trick in a 3-1 first-leg win at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea fought back to lead 3-0 at the Bernab\u00e9u (4-3 aggregate). With time running out, Luka Modri\u0107 delivered an impossible, outside-of-the-boot assist for Rodrygo to make it 3-1, forcing extra time. Unsurprisingly, Benzema found the winner in extra time (5-4 agg.).\u00a0 \n\u2022 Semi-Finals vs. Man City: A seven-goal thriller saw Real Madrid lose 4-3 in the first leg. In the Bernab\u00e9u return, Riyad Mahrez's 73rd-minute goal made it 5-3 on aggregate, leaving Madrid needing two goals in under 17 minutes. Enter Rodrygo again. He scored in the 90th minute, and then a sublime header in the 91st minute\u2014two goals in 89 seconds\u2014to force extra time. A calm Benzema penalty sealed the impossible 6-5 aggregate victory.

I feel people forget how amazing he is. In his first season he was a top3 player in the world. In his second season, his form fell of for 2 reasons, he played the entire season injured and the season was a shitshow. \n\nI really feel that we should try him as a CF role. The Benz and dembele role. IMO, it was his best role in his first season here. \n\nWe should try putting Mbappe as a LW or along side Jude as a second forward, and Arda behind them. Jude will also allow us to score goals from headers.",

But I always keep seeing comments like \"Cama should take Arda's place, him and Bellingham are creative players too! We don't need Arda for *just* creativity.\" but that's simply not true.\n\nIf you look at the key passes and chances created stats, it is not even close and I wanted to share that.  \nArda already has the same amount of key passes as Camavinga or Tchouameni last season or for big chances, he even matched Bellingham's last season LaLiga performance which is crazy to do this early.  \n  \nThis boy has been a fresh breath of air and made a big shift in our team. And thanks to Dean Huijsen's addition + Xabi's new system and coaching, we can better direct plays, create LOTS OF MORE chances and overall we just play better. Unless someone more creative comes, I don't see Arda being dropped for anyone in the current squad. He is the key glue of our team in terms of connecting the midfield to attack right now.\n\nI also feel like Bellingham and Arda will compliment each other really well and play together. Even though it wasn't good the last match we did that, I think that was just Bellingham coming out of injury a bit early and not being in form.",
