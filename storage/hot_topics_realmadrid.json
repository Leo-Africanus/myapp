        "title": "Real Madrid in a standoff with Benfica Over \u00c1lvaro Carreras: Benfica wants to receive the full \u20ac50m release clause, a value the Spanish side is unwilling to pay\u2014especially not in a single installment.",
        "content": "Translation using ChatGPT\n\n\u00c1lvaro Carreras remains a top target for Real Madrid, but Benfica does not want to lose the player, and the price they demand to release the left-back is not pleasing to the Madrid club.\n\nBenfica wants to receive the full \u20ac50 million release clause, a value the Spanish side is unwilling to pay\u2014especially not in a single installment. However, they are open to making an offer of \u20ac30\u201335 million plus bonuses, which could bring the deal closer to the figures Benfica is seeking.\n\nAccording to our findings, the clubs have yet to take concrete or significant steps to bridge the gap, but Real Madrid is aware of the conditions that must be met to make the transfer viable.\n\nAccording to reports published in Spain this Saturday, particularly by AS, Real Madrid\u2014who recently introduced Xabi Alonso as their new coach, replacing Carlo Ancelotti (the Italian will lead the Brazil national team)\u2014is also focused on other signings. The resistance encountered from Benfica is believed to have \"cooled\" their pursuit of Carreras. If this retreat in interest is confirmed, it goes against earlier suggestions that Real Madrid would do everything to sign Carreras before the FIFA Club World Cup and have him play in white during the tournament, which will take place in the United States between June 14 and July 13. This is an important factor in the decision-making process, as Benfica also intends to rely on the left-back for the Club World Cup.\n\nOne possible scenario on the table is that Real Madrid could forgo signing the defender immediately and wait until Benfica finishes their participation in the U.S. Club World Cup. In that case, Benfica might also be more flexible in negotiations.\n\nAs reported by A BOLA, Carreras is happy at Benfica and has a contract until 2029, but returning to play for Real Madrid\u2014the club where he developed\u2014is a dream. In that sense, and as the Italian journalist Fabrizio Romano, a transfer market specialist, reported last week, the player and Real have already reached an agreement. Carreras is reportedly set to earn around \u20ac9 million per season\u2014figures that Benfica cannot match.\n\n\u00c1lvaro Carreras was signed by Benfica in January of the 2023/24 season, initially on loan from Manchester United. He signed permanently at the start of last season for \u20ac6 million (United retained a \u20ac20 million buyback clause, which they are unlikely to exercise). After some initial difficulties, he rapidly established himself, especially after Bruno Lage took over the team. He played 50 matches\u201448 as a starter\u2014scored 4 goals, and provided 5 assists. His strong performances, particularly in the UEFA Champions League, attracted interest from several clubs, with Real Madrid leading the pack. He is only 22 years old and is knocking on the door of Spain\u2019s senior national team.\n\nAccording to the Spanish media, Real Madrid sees Grimaldo\u2014formerly of Benfica and now at Leverkusen\u2014as an alternative to Carreras. However, Grimaldo is 29 years old and would not be a cheap signing either.\n\nCarreras is indeed the top priority for the new coach, Xabi Alonso. Neither Real Madrid nor Benfica has yet made any official statements on the matter. Benfica\u2019s squad is set to return to training next week, and the U.S. Club World Cup kicks off in two weeks.",
