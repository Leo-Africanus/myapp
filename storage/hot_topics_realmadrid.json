        "content": " Lately it feels like Florentino P\u00e9rez might be past his peak as president.\n\nIt increasingly looks like the club is being influenced, or even controlled by players, medical staff, agents, and possibly other parties we don\u2019t see, rather than by a strong, centralized sporting vision from the top.\n\nSome points that raise questions:\n\nRepeated injury crises with little accountability or transparency.\n\nCertain players seemingly having too much leverage over sporting decisions.\n\nSquad planning that feels reactive instead of strategic.\n\nLong-term decisions being delayed or compromised, possibly to satisfy agents or short-term pressures.\n\n\nP\u00e9rez is a historic president. No one can deny what he\u2019s done for Real Madrid financially, institutionally, and globally. But past success doesn\u2019t guarantee present competence. Leadership at this level requires constant sharpness, independence, and the ability to say \u201cno\u201d even to powerful players and stakeholders.\n\nSo the uncomfortable question is: Has P\u00e9rez become too old for the role?\nAnd if so, is it time for him to step aside for someone who can reassert control and modernize the sporting structure of the club?\n\nI\u2019m not pushing an agenda, I\u2019m just genuinely curious what other Madridistas think.",

Honestly after watching this, I feel like not enough blame is put on the board and Perez. The players need to be held accountable by the board and by the manager. When there is no support system between the board and manager you see what\u2019s going on rn with the players having all the power\n\n\n",
