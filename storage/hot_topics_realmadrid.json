        "title": "[ABC.es] Xabi Alonso feels isolated, and his players are taking advantage of his vulnerability. He has recently become a political figure, attempting to win over the dressing room by offering concessions: shorter video sessions, untouchable stars, more days off, fewer tactical obligations",
        "content": "In these 6 months of the Alonso era, the Real Madrid dressing room has not meshed well with him. He arrived to raise the bar, both in training and matches; to impose discipline and order in a dressing room that was spoiled and toxic; and to modernize the team's style of play. As the weeks went by, the players grew increasingly frustrated with his tactical demands, high press, advanced defensive line, endless video sessions, and limited rest days. And Alonso, knowing he was losing the dressing room, gradually gave in, eventually offering them his full support, his arm, and whatever else they asked for.\n\nThe latest example is recent. The before and after the victory at San Mam\u00e9s demonstrates the power of the dressing room. Traveling on Tuesday instead of Wednesday angered a good number of the players, and\u00a0after the win against Athletic, Alonso granted them two days off, when only one had been planned. So the preparation for the match against Celta included only one training session, on Saturday. This is just one example of the many that have occurred since the Vinicius case erupted.\n\nUntil then, Alonso didn't really know what it meant to coach Real Madrid. And that's despite being a player for five years, and having witnessed how a coach like Mourinho lost the support of a large majority of his players when things started to go wrong. Now Alonso himself is experiencing firsthand the influence players have at Real Madrid, but he doesn't understand why he was brought in if, at the first sign of trouble, the club looked the other way, as happened with Vinicius. That's when Xabi understood that he had to manage 25 egos and put his coaching role aside. The beginning of the end.\n\nAlonso believed that coaching on his knees would boost the dressing room, but usually, it's quite the opposite. Everything that has happened in recent weeks has paved the way for what seems imminent: his dismissal.",

        "title": "Blaming Mbappe, Vini, or Alonso Won't solve the problems. It's a collective issue.",
        "content": "For many years, I've tuned into Madrid games. For many years, you could tell that Madrid's young players weren't ready to take over. One of my mates used to say, \"Watch what will happen when the senior guys leave, can these Madrid youngsters do it when they don't have those players to hold their hands?\"\n\nAnd well, we're seeing that now, your players are just not mature enough because they were never asked to be mature.\n\nReal Madrid is an unbalanced squad. The profiles are correct, but the players need a reality check on where they need to be for the team to excel. They need to understand that the team is better than the individual. \n\nLet's break it down:\n\nVini and Mbappe CAN PLAY TOGETHER. The notion that two absolute world-class players best in their positions can't play together is just rubbish. The notion that Vini is selfish and Mbappe is selfish is again rubbish. These are Twitter takes and haters just spewing nonsense. \n\nThe problem that Vini and Mbappe have is that Madrid's Midfield and shape are counter-productive. \n\n Yes, both players like to occupy the left wing and left half space, but we also know that both players are intelligent enough and have good movement to know how to rotate and be in the best possible space, and they have shown multiple times this year that it can work. \n\n  \nMadrid's problem really lies in the fact that your midfield doesn't have a fucking clue. \n\nBellingham is not a 10. Let's just state this. He is not a 10. And the sooner Bellingham accepts this, Xabi accepts this, you won't see much improvement. Bellingham is a box-to-box midfielder and should be employed as such. \n\n  \nThe reason why you don't want Bellingham in the 10 position is because of the attackers that you have. What Madrid needs for 10 is a pure playmaker, your Ozil, Di Maria, Odegard, Guler, Nico Paz. \n\nYou need a pure playmaking 10 here because you have players that are very good off-ball and are very good with receiving the ball at their feet or into space. \n\nBellingham is great in a lot of areas, but his strengths would be best utilized deeper to help progress the ball forward, laying it off to the #10 or distributing it out wide for one of the wingers to drive it forward. \n\nHe can then crash the box to get on cutbacks or crosses, or be the man from deep to break the low block with a deeper unmark runs. \n\nA Bellingham, Tchouameni Pivot could work. \n\n  \nStop Icing Rodrygo. It's simple as that, in every attack especially Madrids, you need that selfless player that will run and run and keep on going. Rodrygo provided that in previous years and he is more than good enough todo so. Now the player might feel disrespected and might feel that the club doesn't care about him but i sincerely believe, that an attack of Vini Mbappe Rodrygo can work and should be working. \n\n  \nYes you do need fullbacks and defenders and maybe adding some more creative midfield players, but your squad has the right profiles and player types to be successful. \n\nVini's head is all about his contract at this point, Rodrygo has one and half foot out the door. \n\nBellingham is in no mans land at this point, even his england spot isn't secure. \n\nBut the noise, the internal distractions, the noise from the outside. Too much non-footballing nonsense is happening at Madrid. \n\n",

        "title": "Cr7 talking about the difference between spanish and English refs",
        "content": "\nHere\u2019s a video of Cry explaining the difference between Spanish referees and English referees, and honestly it perfectly highlights something a lot of fans don\u2019t really think about. In England, the culture around referees is completely different. Players can say things like \u201cfuck off\u201d in the heat of the moment, and most referees just let it slide because they understand it\u2019s part of the intensity and emotion of the match. They don\u2019t take it personally, and they don\u2019t react harshly unless it crosses a very clear line. English refs tend to prioritize keeping the game flowing, so they usually avoid giving cards for simple verbal frustration.\n\nBut in Spain, referees take that kind of language and attitude much more seriously. They view insults or disrespect as a direct challenge to their authority on the pitch. The environment is stricter, the expectations for player behavior are higher, and referees are quicker to show cards if they feel they\u2019ve been disrespected. So something that might be ignored in the Premier League can easily result in a yellow or even a red card in La Liga.\n\nThat\u2019s why this video is so relevant, especially after everything that\u2019s been happening recently  like Bellingham insulting the referee and the whole situation with Carreras\u2019 red card. When you understand how different football cultures treat referees, it actually explains a lot. What players might see as normal reaction or heat-of-the-moment frustration, Spanish refs interpret as a serious offense.\n\nSo I just wanted to share this video because it gives really clear context for those moments. It helps people understand why certain players get punished more harshly in Spain for things they would probably get away with in England. It\u2019s not necessarily about the referee being dramatic , it\u2019s just a different culture and a different standard in how respect is enforced on the pitch.",
