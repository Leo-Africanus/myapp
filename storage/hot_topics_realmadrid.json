        "content": "#FT: CASTILLA 0:0 REAL MURCIA \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#1\u00aa FEDERACI\u00d3N\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:** \n\nRed card: Esteban Saveljich (Real Murcia) 87'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:**\n\n1' - kickoff, vamos! \n\n25' - Fran Gonz\u00e1lez saves a shot by Loren Bur\u00f3n nicely after a cross from the right \n\n38' - David Jim\u00e9nez is completely open in the box, but his shot is too central and the keeper can save it with a good reflex\n\n43' - another big chance for Bur\u00f3n after a recovery near our box, but he puts it wide \n\nHT - Castilla are dominating possession, but it's highly ineffective, while Murcia's striker Loren Bur\u00f3n had two clear chances on the counter but couldn't punish us \n\n46' - 2nd half underway, heavy rain is setting in\n\n55' - big chance again for David Jim\u00e9nez after a quick and direct play by Castilla, Yusi squares it into the box but David puts it wide with his weak foot\n\n70' - Jacobo Ram\u00f3n makes a R\u00fcdiger-like run on the right wing, his cross into the middle gets intercepted by the keeper at the last second before Gonzalo can tap it in\n\n\ud83d\udd04 72' - Borja Alonso and Antonio David for Loren and Chema \n\n\ud83d\udd04 80' - Loren Aguado for Pol Fortuny\n\n84' - great save by Fran Gonz\u00e1lez after a header from Real Murcia \n\n87' - red card for Real Murcia's Saveljich who hits Gonzalo studs up, but only on the follow through - yellow would've been enough imo \n\nFT - 4th draw in a row for Castilla, who continue on their impressive unbeaten run in the whole of 2025, but are struggling in attack with the main man Gonzalo going through a bit of a slump in form. The second half was better and more dangerous from Castilla, but they failed to take their chances, and with the rain getting stronger and stronger throughout the half, playing football ended up being very difficult on the waterlogged pitch that was already very damaged prior to this match\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 20:30 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid \n\n**Referee**: \n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 2, Matchday 29\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[FEF TV](https://feftv.com) (subscription - 12.99\u20ac/month)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (5-3-2): Fran Gonz\u00e1lez - Youssef Enr\u00edquez \u2018Yusi\u2019, Edgar Pujol, Jacobo Ram\u00f3n, Mario Rivas, David Jim\u00e9nez - Jos\u00e9 Maria Andr\u00e9s \u2018Chema\u2019 (72' Antonio David), Manuel \u00c1ngel, Pol Fortuny (80' Loren Aguado) - Gonzalo Garc\u00eda, Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga (72' Borja Alonso) \n\nBench: Diego Pi\u00f1eiro (GK), David Ruiz, Quique Ribes, Andr\u00e9s Campos, \u00c1ngel Carvajal.\n\nUnavailable: Mario de Luis (Spain U21 call-up), Ra\u00fal Asencio (first team call-up), David Cuenca (pubalgia), C\u00e9sar Palacios (ACL tear). \n\nCoach: Ra\u00fal\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** DWDDD\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 7th | 39pt | 9-12-7 | 45:30\n",

In the uk this is not acceptable I know but I\u2019ve heard in Spain it is ?\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t be in all red and screaming but will more than likely be noticeable arsenal fans if anyone could shine light on this I would greatly appreciate it as I wouldn\u2019t like to upset anybody or ruin a trip for ourselves. \n\nBest of luck in the game \nThanks",
