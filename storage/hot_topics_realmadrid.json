He takes a few quick touches to create space, and then cuts his shot across, low into the far corner\n\n\u26bd 25' - goal for OM - Illia punches away a free kick poorly, then their player takes a shot and it hits the post - the ball bounces to Baradji, who takes a little touch, and Joan Mart\u00ednez can't clear it off the line in time (and even then it would've bounced back into the net again), what a crazy and unfortunate goal\n\n\u26bd 27' - GOLLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - and right in the next attack, Fortea advances on the right wing - his powerful and low cross gets deflected into the near corner by Marseille's Doubal! \n\n42' - penalty for OM after a foul by Rivas \n\n\u26bd 42' - Mmadi converts\n\nHT - half time in a very open match where most dangerous situations ended up being goals on both ends - the goals we conceded were entirely avoidable, and the team needs to pay special attention to defending set-pieces better or preventing them from happening in the first place\n\n46' - 2nd half underway \n\n51' - penalty for Juvenil A after Y\u00e1\u00f1ez gets tripped in the box! \n\n\u26bd 53' - GOLLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - Y\u00e1\u00f1ez takes it himself and converts! \n\n\ud83d\udd04 59' - Rivas and Cestero off for Valde and Beto \n\n\ud83d\udd04 71' - Y\u00e1\u00f1ez off for Gabri Valero\n\n\u26bd 80' - GOLLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - golazo de Beto! free kick from around 20 metres out, and Diego Mart\u00ednez strikes it right into the top corner on the goalkeeper's side of the goal! \n\n\ud83d\udd04 83' - last subs, Ciria and Arnu off for Adri P\u00e9rez and Jacobo\n\n\u26bd 90' - GOLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - and the cherry on top, after a dribble by Gabri Valero, he crosses the ball low into the box - it gets deflected towards the far post by the defender, where Adri appears to head it into the net\n\nFT - a calm and controlled second half by the team makes the match end with a comfortable scoreline - they had OM under control defensively much more than in the first half and pounced in the decisive moments in attack. We will get to know the opponents in the Round of 16 and the possible path through the rest of the tournament on Friday\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 16:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee:** Sam Barrott (ENG) \n\n**Competition:** UEFA Youth League, Round of 32\n\n**Viewing options:** [RMTV/RM PLAY](https://play.realmadrid.com/home)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Juvenil A XI (4-3-3):** Illia Voloshyn - Diego Aguado, Mario Rivas (59' Victor Valdepe\u00f1as 'Valde'), Joan Mart\u00ednez, Jes\u00fas Fortea - Jorge Cestero (Diego Mart\u00ednez 'Beto'), Carlos D\u00edez, Thiago Pitarch - Alexis Ciria (83' Adri P\u00e9rez), Adri\u00e1n Arnuncio \u2018Arnu\u2019 (83'' Jacobo Ortega), Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (71' Gabri Valero)\n\nBench: \u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez (GK), Melvin Ukpeigbe, \u00c1lvaro Lezcano, Pol Dur\u00e1n. \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro L\u00f3pez\n",

Because of the fact he is in this position, I feel he has a lot more area to cover or \"walk around in.\" \n\nBecause of this, I feel like he makes less runs back. When I watched him as a LW at the start and early years of his career, he did actually contribute a little defensively. \n\nThis makes me want to see Vini left, Garcia CF and Mbappe right more than ever. When Mbappe has to work harder for his goals, a lot of his 'bad' qualities may automatically disappear. ",

        "title": "Why Toni Kroos was the greatest midfielder",
        "content": "Hello everyone, I know this title will have many in doubts, but let me explain. In this story I want to show you some of the numbers of Toni Kroos, which no one see's. I would say, Kroos forces the game being played like he wants it. I will go through different statistics and give you also some comparable other players stats as well. The values inside the tables are all rounded just for readability, but this doesn't change anything for the facts!\n\n1. Pass volume &amp; accuracy (2017 - 2023)\n\n* **Pass volume** = total attempted passes\n* **Pass accuracy** = percentage of successful passes\n\n|Name|Passing Volume|Passing Accuracy|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Sergio Busqusts|18.300|90|\n|Toni Kroos|18.700|90|\n|Joshua Kimmich|19.800|85|\n|Rodri|20.000|92|\n\nThey are the top 4, the best of the best and what can see? Toni Kroos is not number 1, but don't stop reading yet!\n\n2. Ball contacts before losing the ball\n\n* **Touches per ball loss** = how many touches a player makes before losing the ball\n* **Minutes played** = total minutes played (2017\u20132023)\n\n|Name|Minutes Played|Touches per ball loss|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Joshua Kimmich|23.300|57|\n|Rodri|23.500|67|\n|Sergio Busquets|23.000|78|\n|Toni Kroos|20.800|95|\n\nThis metrics doesn't look to relevant, but it gives us one important information. No matter what game situation you're in - you could pass to Kroos and he could calm the situation for you. In average Toni Kroos losses the ball after touching it 95 times before. However this could bring up the idea, he is just playing safe and doesn't take risks. Wrong!\n\n3. Progressions per ball loss\n\n* **Progressions per ball loss** = how many forward/progressive actions a player makes before losing the ball\n* **Minutes played** = total minutes played (2017\u20132023)\n\n|Name|Minutes Played|Progressions per ball lose|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Joshua Kimmich|23.300|12|\n|Rodri|23.500|12|\n|Sergio Busquets|23.000|15|\n|Toni Kroos|20.800|23|\n\nThis table shows us, that Toni Kroos is not just a player that hides, has a lot of touches and doesn't do anything with it. He is still creating more progression than any of his competitors with having also a comfortable lead. However progression doesn't always mean dangerous, that's what we will look at next.\n\n4. Passes into final third\n\n* **Passes into final third** = number of passes played into the attacking third\n* **Minutes played** = total Champions League minutes (2017\u20132023)\n\n|Name|Minutes Played|Passes into final third|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Luka Modric|5.700|500|\n|Rodri|5.000|510|\n|Joshua Kimmich|7.500|660|\n|Toni Kroos|5.800|740|\n\nDespite him being the safest midfielder of all time, he is also the most dangerous creator of all time - since UCL 2003. While we were waiting for Cristiano, Vini Jr. and everyone else scoring goals, Kroos was the one directing the game into the dangerous zones. He didn't wait for the moment, he created it - for more than a decade.\n\nTaken together, the data shows why Toni Kroos was indispensable to Real Madrid\u2019s success: with unmatched passing accuracy, ball security, progression efficiency, and elite volume of passes into the final third, he consistently controlled games while advancing play with minimal risk\u2014turning dominance in possession into sustained attacking pressure.\n\nIn case you've read everything, please tell me your opinion and have a great day!",

        "title": "RM needs a deep restructuring",
        "content": "This Real Madrid doesn\u2019t work. That I think we can all agree on. Then I hear some blaming Vini, some Mbappe, others remembering Kroos and Luka and many looking at Florentino. How divided we are as fans is a reflection of how complex are Madrid\u2019s problems.\n\nSo here\u2019s my hot take:\n\nMadrid and Florentino haven\u2019t outgrown the phase where they can just buy players and simply trust top world talent with a people manager. It worked with the generation of CR7, Modric, Kroos, Ramos, etc. It didn\u2019t with the galacticos, and now it\u2019s not working again.\n\nIn today\u2019s world, with state owned clubs and both money and talent pouring into the Premier League, this approach is much harder - we just can\u2019t compete financially or as the attractive top league we were 10 years ago, and it\u2019s starting to show. \n\nWe can\u2019t easily buy top talent like we did before. Zidane was signed in months, CR7 didn\u2019t take much longer. Now we are relying on our legacy more than ever before and waiting years for contracts to expire to sign top talent. Instead of signing what is needed, when it\u2019s needed. You can\u2019t build a team like that.\n\nReal Madrid needs to pivot into becoming a team that wins by playing football collectively, a team that has a long term manager with a long term strategy - from the youth squad to the senior squad. The pay to win strategy just doesn\u2019t work for us anymore.\n\nMadrid needs a deep restructuring or we risk becoming the next Manchester United. \n\nWhat do you guys think? \n\nCan Madrid continue to win long-term with the same model (and president) that both gave us the galacticos disaster but later brought us 6 Champions Leagues?

        "title": "We won the UCL the year before last",
        "content": "Based off the discourse in this subreddit, I\u2019m not sure if people are aware, but we did win the Champions League in 2024. To give this some context: this is the 70th rendition of the UCL. Assuming we don\u2019t win this year, we will have won the UCL about once every 5 years. The second winningest club, AC Milan, will have won once every 10. Barca has not made it to the UCL final in over a decade. There are currently 17 players on our roster who have won the UCL with Real Madrid. They did not win due to coincidence.\n\nWe had a bad year last year due to the departure of some major players, and the addition of a new major component who has been more challenging to adapt to. This year we had a coach who, for whatever reason, did not work out. I think that the pessimism and dooming that has become so common is unfair to the current players, many of who have been instrumental in winning us 2 UCLs, a feat any other club would go crazy for. Unfair to the leadership of the club who for a decade and a half have been overseeing the most successful era in the history not of this club, but of this sport. And unfair to Arbeloa, a coach who was very successful during his stint in the youth teams, a man who sided with CR7 and Mourinho during a tumultuous time that ended up defining the next decade, and a new figure for the club who should be met with excitement and optimism but is instead greeted with bitterness due to feelings about the exit of his predecesor.\n\nI still believe that the leadership of this club which has been so successful knows what they are doing. I believe that the players who have won us more in the last 5 years than most do in their whole careers will win for us again. While I am saddened by how Xabi\u2019s stint turned out, I believe in Arbeloa as a man and as a manager. Above all, I believe in Real Madrid\u2019s ability to come back when everything is stacked against us and all but Madridistas have lost hope. ",

        "content": "Football is a very short lived sport. Managers nowadays barely last more than two seasons, after two losses in a row it\u00b4s crisis, what happened the season before doesn\u00b4t really count, what could potentially happen in two years after also doesn\\`t.  Real Madrid is probably the pinnacle of that.\n\nOn the other side more and more big clubs are signing project players. Players who obviously have talent, but who are still raw and who still need a bit of time. So Real Madrid signed the likes of Vinicius, Rodrygo, Reinier, Endrick, Mastantuono, Camavinga, Hujisen. Man City signed the likes of Khusanov, Victor Reis, Doku, Savinho. Chelsea signed so many like talented 20 year olds, they are basically hoarding talent.\n\nNow this works as long as there is an experienced core of players around kind of leading them. So Real Madrid were fine when the likes of Kroos, Modric, a fit version of Carvajal, Benzema...were still around. It actually looked like they got the transition spot on. Man City were fine when they still had De Bruyne, Walker, the peak versions of Ruben Dias and Rodri leading the team. \n\nProblems start when the experienced core of players is starting to fail. In Real Madrid\u00b4s case the current experienced core of players age wise (apart from Courtois) is Carvajal, Alaba, R\u00fcdiger, Mendy, maybe Ceballos. 4 players who have had massive injury issues and one player who has never really been more than a squad player. After that you have the likes of Militao and Trent, who have also had big injury problems this season. The oldest outfield player who is actually playing is Valverde at 27. \n\n3 of Real Madrid\u00b4s back four currently are Carreras, Hujisen and Asencio. I\u00b4m happy all three of them are at the club, I think they could all have good careers at the club but they probably shouldn\u00b4t be starting together at this point in their career. \n\nCompare that to the Champions League winning sides of Real Madrid in the last 15 years. The youngest starting 11 in a final was the la decima starting eleven and the average age was 26.7 years and it would have been older if Xabi Alonso hadn\u00b4t been suspended and Pepe had been fit to start. \n\n",

        "content": "I have been focusing on Franco lately and everytime i notice more and more that he is an average player at best, he has potential to be very good but i can\u2019t see anything special about him.. his touches on the ball sometimes are very bad .. decision making is horrendous.. he has given us sometimes glimpses and nice passes but we all know this nothing so special.. we have made a mistake with sending endrick on loan and leaving him , it should have been the opposite. I personally think endrick will do a better job than him on rw or even arda is more dangerous on rw.. he may has the pressing thing better than others and that\u2019s why arbeloa and even xabi likes to start him. But i think this transfer window we should have bought someone a bit better and a natural rw .. i maybe wrong in the future i hope im wrong and he will succeed and be our next Di maria.",

        "content": "Has last season &amp; even this season till now been optimal? No. Does the squad look unbalanced? 100% but we gotta stop being so reactionary.\n\nREAL MADRID ARE ALLOWED A TRANSITION PERIOD. Same thing happened in 2018 when Ronaldo left &amp; the squad fell of a cliff. It was aged &amp; needed a major revamp. The revamp happened gradually &amp; eventually made history under Carlo.\n\nSo why are we so impatient this time? The squad has major holes mainly in midfield &amp; CB options. New signings haven't been upto the mark. But its okay? Huijsen &amp; Franco are so young? Let them grow? TAA has barely played? Carreras has been fantastic.\n\nEvery club needs a transition period. With 2-3 more signings &amp; this year's signings settling in properly I'm sure this club will be back to the top.\n\nCriticising is totally fine but writing Real Madrid of all clubs off as if their era is over just cause a turbulent few years is completely braindead imo.",

I saw no mention that it was even happening to I thought I would share the news with you all about the loss today.\n\nReal Madrid Femenino have not won a trophy yet. The 2020\u201321 season was their first season. This was the 22nd meeting of the women's Cl\u00e1sico and Real Madrid has only won once. The matches are very rarely close. Real Madrid has scored 10 goals and given up 77. So as a fan who watches the matches, they are pretty painful to watch to be honest.",

Not out of ignorance, but because the player is forgotten to that extent.\n\n\u20ac30 million for a player who never played a single minute for the first team is embarrassing and almost comical. Easily a top-five worst signing in the club\u2019s history.\n\nAnyways.. he\u2019s still only 24. I hope he manages to find himself again. Maybe he\u2019ll get another chance to play in Europe.",
