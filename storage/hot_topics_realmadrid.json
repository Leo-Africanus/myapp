Anyway, all I'm saying is, we created good chances, we had shots on target, Mbappe was great, Franco was good, Hujsen is looking great, Vini is still just average, but atleast thats better than being trash. I'm not saying don't panic, I'm saying don't panic FOR NOW. We can criticise after 6-7 games. We played quite well for a team that had such high defensive pressure. Our plays will just get better, we got this. Hala Madrid!",

He was on the ball more in the second half. I feel like his best position is on the right hand side of the midfield with Guler operating in the centre. Yesterday I felt like he was one player with the least impact for the team with Trent . This is not a criticism at any point by the way I know how much he means to us we all absolutely adore him.

At the start, he missed easy passes, missed penalties, even looked like he couldn\u2019t handle pressure. People wanted him sold, saying he was destroying the team. But he kept working, kept improving, and in the end he won the Pichichi. Those same fans went silent.\n\nNow it\u2019s the same story with Xabi and the team. These plastic fans don\u2019t want to wait. They just want to bash players and push their own agenda. One bad pass, one slow game, and they start crying.\n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s new players, a new system, new tactics, and a new manager. You all want to judge everything after just three weeks of training? We all know the biggest danger in the league is losing points. That\u2019s what matters most. Beautiful football is nice, but points win us the league.\n\nYes, we are lacking in some areas like the final third. And yes, the coach is experimenting in his early days. But that\u2019s part of the process. Let them breathe, give them time, and trust the project.\n\nIn Real Madrid, I believe.\nHala Madrid.\n",

No disrespect to Rodrygo but what is the point of comparison when the guy is uncertain about his future at the club?

        "content": "I hope I\u2019m not the only one noticing a lack of technical quality in the midfield. \n\nTchouameni is very good at recovering balls and providing some stability in the midfield, but whenever this guy has the ball at his feet, I\u2019m just scared about what he will do to be honest. \n\nThe same can be said about Valverde. Yes he spends so much energy on the field, he can break lines with his runs, he can track back and recover balls. But balls at his feet ? He hasn\u2019t stepped up technically in the slightest to make us forget about Kroos\u2019s absence. \n\nOur midfielders can only control the ball and make simple passes. No line breaking passes, no tempo controlling, no switch of play\u2026 Guler used to do all of that when he was in a lower position, but yesterday Xabi put him in his usual position (10/false 9) and his teammates couldn\u2019t pass to him. Of course it went this way because Osasuna were playing low block and cutting off any pass lines leading to our dangerous players, but if we had more technical players in the midfield, we would\u2019ve created more opportunities than that. \n\nBellingham\u2019s absence is obviously a problem, he\u2019s basically our only other midfielder who\u2019s comfortable on the ball, press resistant aside from Guler, and I think we need to build our midfield on these two for the future. Valverde and Tchouameni must improve their technicality imo or we\u2019ll have to put one of the two on the bench. Look at the midfields of the strongest teams in the world. PSG, Barca, Liverpool\u2026 they all have three highly technical players in their midfield. Yesterday, we had only Guler and he was too high on the field to create plays. We\u2019re gonna have to build the midfield around Bellingham + Guler, and find something that works around them, but I\u2019m not confident with the players that we have. ",

PSG project took time , so will this. \n\nNow coming to Vini and Trent , vini was tracking back , thats a step forwards , thats enough , one step at a time. Trent was playing in front of the bernabeu crowd for the first time and he has a risk taking role( Passes to break the lines) sometimes it works , sometimes it doesn't.

Alexander-Arnold's arrival from Liverpool was Real's most high-profile piece of business this summer, but he may have to split game time with the Spaniard, who came fourth in the Ballon d'Or last year.\" \n\nThoughts? Have you seen enough from Trent to think he should be first-choice right-back? I know he was a free transfer, but still Trent was a high-profile signing. Personally having watched a lot of Liverpool, Trent can definitely be a defensive liability, especially in 1v1s, but offensively he can make attacking passes that very few other players can. I suspect Alonso will make his choice as the season progresses and based on the opponent's style of play/wingers that would matchup against right-back.   \n",

        "content": "I think that the game was good. \nOf course we should tweak a lot of things but I got a good feeling from the game.\nAbout newcomers:\nHuijsen: a lot of quality in this guy, I would like to compare him to Jude - he is very mature and confident, can\u2019t be more happy for our defence with him.\nTrent: he is shy at the moment, but I think it\u2019s natural and eventually he will integrate. He was outplayed a couple of times but I think he will get better, for now his passes aren\u2019t working like in Liverpool but again I think it will come.\nCarreras: a decent game from him , he got pace and he is aggressive in defending which is beneficial.I think he and Fran gonna give us a solid stack for the season.\nFranco M. : can\u2019t tell much but I can see his potential.\n\n\nSo, Xabi is basically cooking for a month+ and I can see the positives : energy, desire, running, motion.\nStill there is some of Ancelotti\u2019s habits but it will go away. Those habits could be labeled as a con in today\u2019s game , we just need some time.\nI think in 5 matches and throughout them we\u2019ll get to clicking.\n\nLots of \u201cbuts\u201d but I will stay positive.\n\nBTW, happy for Carvajal and it was not good to see him falling down near the end of match.",

        "content": "I\u2019ve always been curious about Hazard\u2019s time at Madrid. At Chelsea he was world-class, one of the best attackers in Europe, but at Madrid he never really got going. Was it just injuries holding him back, or was there more to it?\n\nSome people say his fitness wasn\u2019t great, others think the pressure of being the big signing after Ronaldo was too much. Personally, I feel like he just had terrible luck with timing and every time he started to look sharp, he picked up another injury.",

The team is a team and should not be pitted against each other in such a fashion.\nIt just has me angry.",
