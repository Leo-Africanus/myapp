While we know we have incredible players like Rodrygo, Mbapp\u00e9, and Vini, and their talent can light up any game, overconfidence has a way of backfiring. This is something Barcelona fans have also dealt with, it even reflected in their players\u2019 comments.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t call me arrogant when I keep winning.\u201d Yet, football has proven time and again that such thinking can lead to unexpected outcomes. For example, Inter is often dismissed as \u201cjust a defensive team that sits back,\u201d but underestimating them is a dangerous mistake. The same overconfidence struck AC Milan in 2007 when they thought they were above Liverpool before the Champions League final. They were humbled in the most memorable way.\n\nFor us to maintain our consistency as a team, it\u2019s essential that our players respect the game, their opponents, and the effort required to succeed. I hope next season, they approach every match with 100% effort and avoid falling into the trap of overconfidence.\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who pointed out that Milan actually won in 2007. I was referring to the 2005 final.",

        "content": "Whenever someone makes a big mistake, many fans suggest they be sold. Brahim Diaz played one bad game against Barcelona (he didn\u2019t even play the entire 90 minutes) and people forget his contributions towards the club.\n\nHe usually plays well and Madrid wouldn\u2019t have made it past Atletico without him. Also, there were multiple reasons why Madrid lost last el clasico, including Vinicius\u2019 poor decision making, Rodrygo\u2019s off season, many injuries, and Ancelotti\u2019s tactics.\n\nEdit: Some of you guys failed to understand that I am saying that you shouldn\u2019t say to sell a player and get so angry at them after a few mistakes here and there. It\u2019s alright to say that a player is PART of the reason a team lost but to blame them entirely is another thing. I\u2019m not being a hypocrite by pointing out the failures of other players too, and I even admitted that Brahim had a bad game (it\u2019s implied that he was part of the reason Madrid lost).",

        "content": "We\u2019re dealing with a Barca that\u2019s either just had their confidence deeply shaken or a Barca that\u2019s even more invigorated to go and secure the title.\n\nEither way, I think this is our best (and probably last chance) to salvage this season beyond the CWC. Winning the Clasico next week would not only partially redeem us for past defeats and embarrassments from them this season, but give us something to bite on, build our charge on. If we win, we\u2019d fall 1 point behind Barca, with 4 games to go. After some of the questionable performances this team (players AND coaching staff alike) have given us, this is the time to prove themselves worthy of the badge.",

        "content": "Yall can hate me for this but I think signing saliba would be a not so good signing for Madrid to be honest, I personally think the club should push for hujisen and use more of the academy (after all what\u2019s bad about having more actual Spanish blood on the team) and about what people are saying about jacabo I think it\u2019s almost unfair to judge him and compare him to asencio since we got extremely lucky that he was good from the start. \n\nThings take time and he has barely played this season and has been said to been great for the academy. Do yall remember gulers performance against Villarreal? And all the mistakes he made and all the fans saying that his time is over? Look at him now. \n\nId say until he gets more game time then it\u2019s unfair to give a true answer for him.\n\nAlso Joan Martinez is coming back so there\u2019s really no need for saliba. Just my opinion though. \n ",
