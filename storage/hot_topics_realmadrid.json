        "content": "Hes been the best player for the past two years for Real. He shows up at every game and puts his heart sweat and tears. He is the only player Real cant go without at the moment, he played in 6 different positions in the last year and has excelled every time. Hes just built different and i dont think people give him enough credit.",

        "content": "I watch La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the CL, in addition to any Real Madrid match. Quite frankly, I have only watched Arsenal that one time we lost in the 2006ish and the final they lost to Barcelona. They haven't been relevant in Europe in quite a while and while I don't follow, other teams in the premier league, it's a little easier to get an idea how Liverpool is doing, as I've watched their games in the CL and they have been pretty strong for quite a while.\n\nI went to their sub-reddit and they are quite confident and excited about this match. How do you think we'll do against them? What would you say we could exploit or watch for based on their known performance?\n\n  \nI honestly would love to read some of the opinions, specially those who follow the EPL and have been watching Arsenal.",
