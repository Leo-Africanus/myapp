And MAN HIS PRESSING AND RUNNING is Godzilla level..This is exactly what we were missing last season. \n\nFor me, Mastantuano is an undisputed starter. \n\nI would love a 4-3-3 in the next match\n\nVini, Mbappe and Mastantuano as Forwards\nJude as creative outlet.

We have a lot of quality players right now, but the question is, who should start. What would be the best formation to play with, and who should be dropped. So far it seems like Mastantuono will be dropped, but that means playing with 4 midfielders. Which has proven to be good before, but I don\u2019t know if that is Xabi\u2019s style. Valverde, Mbappe, Tchoumeni and Bellingham seem to be the fixed players that have to start in important games. And now Guler is also an important piece. What do you think would be the best formation for this. ",
