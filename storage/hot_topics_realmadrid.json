They have to be a world beaters almost without flaws, like Jude Bellingham, to start in this team. \n\nWhat kind of moron you have to be to bitch about the minutes of 19 y.o. kid when he decided to join the biggest club itw packed with stars, and then said he didn't want a loan? On top of that, when he did have a chance in a tough match vs Liverpool he was poor. \n\nJust calm the fuck down, if he works hard he could be very important player at RM, but nothig is given for free here. And it's not Ancelotti's characteristic, it was the same with Zidane and will be the same with every other manager. Some stans are just mad that their boy isn't a hybrid of Messi and Zidane like they wanted us to believe.",

        "title": "First visit ever/AMA/personal experience post/important for people that are afraid of heights",
        "content": "I fulfilled my dream and finally visited Santiago Bernab\u00e9u this weekend. I\u2019m going to write a piece about how I felt about the Classic Tour and everything before, during, and after the match so it can help people get a better understanding.\n\nI went with a friend and chose the Girona match to be sure we had tickets \u2013 well, this did not go well. Both of us are Madridistas and joined the queue on Tuesday at 10 AM. I had 36 minutes in the waiting line, while he had 42. We didn\u2019t get a ticket after the wait, and my friend got in, only to be kicked out instantly. We thought this can't be real, so we tried all day and still nothing. We tried again the next day when tickets opened to the public, but still nothing. We tried searching with third-party sellers, where you had to pay 350-400 euros instead of 100 euros on the official site, but we said no way. We decided to buy tickets even though we wouldn\u2019t sit next to each other, because sometimes you saw empty seats, and 95 percent of the time, there was only one seat free on Entradas or the official Real Madrid site. While we were waiting on our flight Friday, we both lucked out and found seats\u2014my friend for 208 euros and myself for 110. He was sitting in Sector 232, while I was way up in 601. Important thing for people who are afraid of heights: don\u2019t buy a ticket that is higher up, even if you manage to get one. I was dizzy the whole time, and my hand didn\u2019t leave the railing. I was thinking about buying a new ticket as soon as I was up there. The people next to me didn\u2019t have any problem. Pro tip: Do the tour before you go and watch the game. With the Classic Tour, you get a panoramic view, and it\u2019s perfect to see if you have any issues with the steepness.\n\n# Classic Tour Experience\n\nSeeing the stadium was insane, even while construction outside is still happening. Take the Metro; it\u2019s very easy, and you come out right in front of the stadium. You walk 3 minutes to the tour entrance. We reserved time slots and didn\u2019t wait a second. The tour was very nice, with an amazing amount to see, but it was packed with tons of people, so you had to wait several minutes at popular spots like the Wall of Ballon d'Or and other areas.\n\n**Cons of the tour:** You can take pictures with the Champions League trophy and in front of a green screen with your choice of player. You get a QR code and think, nice, but it didn\u2019t say anything about the costs or that you had to pay. Right before the tour ends and you enter the shop, you have to wait in line to pay for the pictures. After 15 minutes of waiting, the lady started charging 15 euros per picture, but when I just asked, \u201cHow much for digital only?\u201d she replied that you can\u2019t buy them digitally. It was a big waste of time, and people were annoyed around us. The shop was packed too, and it\u2019s expensive\u201410 euros for a keychain and 6 euros for the usual shopping bag with a Madrid logo on it. Be prepared to pay a ton of money for merch\n\n# Matchday vs Girona\n\nWe went 3 hours earlier, and it was already packed. Since I was searching Reddit and didn\u2019t find much info about the arrival of the team bus, I\u2019ll try to be precise about how it was for me that day. Plaza de los Sagrados Corazones is where people were waiting and where the bus passes. I added a picture showing where the bus comes from and where it passes. We waited on the roundabout, heading toward the stadium (Taco Bell is visible in the picture), and the police moved us 3 times to the right side. The Girona team bus arrived 2 hours before the match. Real Madrid\u2019s team bus arrived exactly at 14:40 (match start was 16:15), and it was not worth it. You stand the whole time, with people bumping into you, wanting to get closer, and after waiting 1 hour 30 minutes, the bus didn\u2019t do a round in the roundabout but drove straight to the stadium entrance for the bus. We were hoping they would circle at least once so people could enjoy it more and maybe see someone. A 90-minute wait for a 15-second look at the team bus without seeing anyone is the summary of that experience.\n\n[marked lines is where the bus passes](https://preview.redd.it/lc9liy8sl8le1.jpg?width=1206&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c2648eecde75e430f715c3b56c39273f8899962)\n\nAfter that, the gates opened (90 minutes prior to the match), and the lines formed were insane. Got lucky and waited only 5 minutes, if even, and went up to Sector 601 to my seat. My friend was at the opposite side near the coaches. Again, if you\u2019re afraid of heights, do the tour with the panoramic view. Even my friend, who\u2019s not afraid of heights, got dizzy when we did the tour. Only me and one other person were in the row, and I was thinking, \u201cWhy was it so hard to find tickets? It\u2019s not even sold out.\u201d 20 minutes before the match started, some people started coming, but not many, and then 5-10 minutes before the match, our row was full. I was surprised that even that high up, it was going to be full. It gets easier with the dizziness as soon as people are next to you, and when the match starts, you forget about it almost completely. Seeing the warm-up and the match start was an indescribable feeling\u2014every Real Madrid fan has to experience this insane feeling. Buy your snacks and drinks before the match, believe me\u2014you\u2019ll wait 10-15 minutes if you\u2019re lucky to buy something, and another 5 if you need to visit the toilet. When the final whistle blew and the match ended, it was disappointing that the team didn\u2019t come and celebrate with the fans in the stands. They almost sprinted into the changing room; only a few players stood there after the game\u2014a big thank you to them.\n\nDon\u2019t try to rush out. You won\u2019t be the first or last to leave the stadium. Take your time, enjoy the stadium, and leave after some minutes. When I got out, 15 minutes after the game, there were still tons of people outside. My friend and I had decided beforehand to make reservations at a restaurant near the stadium so we could eat and then go back to the hotel after. This was a very good decision, considering the thousands of people taking public transport.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nEvery cent I spent on this trip was worth it. Watching a game live and seeing the dream goal of Modri\u0107 was the absolute highlight. So if you ever ask yourself if it\u2019s worth it\u2014100 percent. Don\u2019t buy tickets from third-party sites. We always found some seats 2 days or 1 day before\u2014even 30 minutes before the game, I checked, and some spots were available. Don\u2019t give up; you\u2019ll find one eventually, but don\u2019t expect to sit next to each other. If you have any questions, feel free to comment or DM. I hope this post will be helpful to atleast someone and sorry for all the spelling mistakes, English is not my fist language :) \n\n",
