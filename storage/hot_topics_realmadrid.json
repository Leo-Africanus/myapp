        "content": "In 2025, Real Madrid conceded\u00a0**80 goals in 67 matches across all competitions**.  \nAmong all teams in Europe\u2019s top five leagues, only\u00a0**Tottenham Hotspur**\u00a0conceded more goals this year (83 goals in 59 matches), while\u00a0**Brest**\u00a0also conceded 80.\n\nThe decline of key defenders due to\u00a0**age, loss of pace, and recurring injuries**\u00a0has been impossible to ignore.  \nDavid Alaba, for example, suffered\u00a0seven separate injuries in a single season, missing a total of\u00a0520 days.  \n\u00c9der Milit\u00e3o, after suffering a second ACL rupture in 2024, has only returned to around\u00a070% of his previous level.  \nAntonio R\u00fcdiger\u00a0played through persistent knee issues before ultimately opting for surgery at the end of the season.\n\nWith the defensive core constantly unavailable, Real Madrid were forced to rely on\u00a0non-defenders like Tchouam\u00e9ni and Lucas V\u00e1zquez\u00a0to fill in at the back, leading to a dramatic drop in stability and cohesion.\n\nThe collapse of Madrid\u2019s defense is not only the result of bad luck with injuries or an aging back line \u2014 it also exposes flaws in\u00a0recruitment strategy and tactical planning.  \nHistorically, Madrid managed to pull themselves out of defensive crises with partnerships like\u00a0Pepe and Sergio Ramos.  \nThe question now is:\u00a0**how long will it take before we see defenders of that level again at the Bernab\u00e9u?**",

I highly doubt that he will lower his salary, and his performances have been so under par that he does not deserve that contract. I don\u2019t see him picking up his level, and many of his childish actions are starting to annoy even his most loyal supporters. It\u2019s funny how many think that the fanbase is being fake, when we have supported him a lot. Mbappe being in the team makes him the main man, there is no spot for Vini who wants to be the star. There is just a lot of reasons why Vini will most likely leave. If by any chance, we give him the contract he wants, then that will be a massive mistake. If he leaves for a decent amount of money, or even he doesn\u2019t bring much money, it will open up space for other important signings. The best move is for him to leave, not only for the club but for his own career.\n\nEdit: No, I am not a player fan. I don\u2019t care who plays or doesn\u2019t as long as we win. I care about the club winning.",

        "content": "Vini's dip in form is not only about his own level of play - it has a lot to do with the lack of quality on our right wing. \n\nWith Rodrygo loss of form last season and the lack of any outstanding right wing this season, the amount of defenders Vini is expected to beat has grown. \n\nCurrently all our potential right wingers (Rodrygo [unless he regains his form],Mastantouno, Arda and Valverde) all cannot beat any defender one on one. If there's a defender in front of them they are cutting in or passing back. \n\nThis means the defence is never stretched and there is always an extra man or two that can cover the RB should Vini get past him.\n\nThe only player we had that needed two defenders to guard him on the right wing will be playing for Olympique Lyon until the end of the season.

        "content": "I\u2019ll always tune in, but it just feels like something I do out of habit. It\u2019s the same cycle every week. I tune into Real Madrid, hold hopes for a good or even decent game, and boom. 1-3 opponent chances along with a Courtois save within the first 5 minutes. It\u2019s not even a meme anymore it\u2019s literally almost a given at this point. This is then followed by a series of passes that do next to nothing, a hopeless cross, and a shot from outside the box. This continues on for about 60 minutes until our opponent finally capitalizes on their chances and score. The score is now 1-0. The Madrid players realize they\u2019re down a goal and seem to remember they have a game to win. They\u2019ll turn up the intensity and eventually get away with a scrappy, but well earned goal. Both sides will stalemate until the 80th minute, with the opponent winning the pressure match, but Madrid somehow coming away victorious with a goal that came out of nowhere. \n\nMedia will save their Vini contract talk tweets for another day, something about the dressing room having more confidence in Xabi, and some record Mbappe broke or is about to break. Rinse repeat until we\u2019re knocked out the UCL and come 2nd in LaLiga.",
