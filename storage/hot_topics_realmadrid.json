        "content": "#FT: OSASUNA B 1:0 CASTILLA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#1\u00aa FEDERACI\u00d3N\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:** \n\n1:0 Ander Yoldi 22'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - kick off, vamos! \n\n5' - the streaming platform is showing the wrong match... Every year it's a new platform, but the same incompetence in this league... \n\n15' - first quarter of an hour is gone, LaLiga+ has not noticed their error so far, and I still can't watch the game - I hope the team started well... \n\n\u26bd 22' - Osasuna score - I still cannot watch the match\n\n35' - 34 minutes played, and they finally put the correct match! \n\nHT - obviously I could only watch the last 10 minutes, but the way Castilla are playing is straight up alarming, they fail to create any danger at all, can't get tempo into their attacking and are also shaky in defense despite little pressure by Osasuna who focus on defending their lead\n\n46' - 2nd half underway \n\n\ud83d\udd04 59' - first sub, Y\u00e1\u00f1ez on for Pol Fortuny \n\n\ud83d\udd04 66' - next sub, Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga for Thiago Pitarch. An absolutely terrible second half of the team so far, absolutely no danger whatsoever\n\n70' - Fran Gonz\u00e1lez keeps the team in the match with a great 1v1 save after an easy counter by Osasuna - this team needs to wake up! \n\n76' - a penalty is reviewed for a pull on Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, but the ref does not change his decision. For me, it was not enough\n\n\ud83d\udd04 78' - Palacios off for Gabri Castrelo, last sub \n\n79' - first good chance for Castilla in possibly the entire game - Castrelo's shot from a tight angle is saved nicely by their keeper\n\n82' - Aguado takes a rebound on the volley nicely, but it flies just over the bar \n\nFT - an absolutely awful performance by Castilla leads to the third loss in a row, without scoring a single goal, or I'd even say, without generating a single clear cut chance for the past 270 minutes. With the U20 World Cup coming up and Fortea, Pitarch, Cristian, Fran and Aguado being out for at least a month, this situation can go from bad to worse if Arbeloa doesn't rethink everything about the way he sets up this team, this way of playing doesn't work, we need to give up the control so there is some space to play into, especially since we don't have any attacker that can make the difference by himself against a tough defence\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 12:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Instalaciones Deportivas de Tajonar, Pamplona\n\n**Referee**: Aimar Velasco Arbaiza\n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 1, Matchday 4\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[LaLiga+](https://www.laligaplus.laliga.com/) (subscription - 14.99\u20ac/month) (only available in Spain)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-3-3): Fran Gonz\u00e1lez - Diego Aguado, Lamini Fati, Joan Mart\u00ednez, Jesus Fortea - Jorge Cestero, Thiago Pitarch (66' Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga), Manuel \u00c1ngel - Bruno Iglesias, C\u00e9sar Palacios (78' Gabri Castrelo), Pol Fortuny (59' Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez) \n\nBench: Guille S\u00fanico (GK), Alejandro Moya, Mario Rivas, Manu Serrano, V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as, Cristian David, Roberto Mart\u00edn, Jacobo Ortega. \n\nUnavailable: Sergio Mestre (first team call-up), David Jim\u00e9nez (first team call-up), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Rachad Fettal (injury). \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** WWLL\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 16th | 3pt | 1-0-2 | 2:3\n",

This is not a critique to Valverde, he is my favorite player in Madrid, but it is evident he has not been the most important part of the team anymore. So, why is Valverde not as highlighted as he used to? I believe it is because of being given a specific role. Valverde is a kind of player that should play out of scheme. He was the one who ran everywhere on the pitch and made sure to contribute everywhere. However, this is also a good sign, the fact that Valverde is not being seen as much means that the team is not a mess like last year. If Valverde is the best player in the team that\u2019s unfortunately a bad sign. I feel like he should one of the only players in the team with no instructions since he is the best at moving around the pitch to contribute. ",

He showed more class and energy in that 5 mins cameo than some of our players have shown in 90.\n\nAnd I am so glad to see what a monster Mastantuano really is. So fuckin happy that he doesn't have to go through the bullshit Development program that Carlo made players go through. His close control is second to none in tight spaces. And MAN HIS PRESSING AND RUNNING is Godzilla level..This is exactly what we were missing last season. \n\nFor me, Mastantuano is an undisputed starter. \n\nI would love a 4-3-3 in the next match\n\nVini, Mbappe and Mastantuano as Forwards\nJude as creative outlet. Fede b2b and Tchoumeni DM. Possesion DLP by Dean Huijsen. \n\nHappy days ahead. ",

        "content": "  Bellingham is back, Mastantuono has shown a lot of talent, and Guler keeps being a good playmaker. Rodrygo is still on the bench and Camavinga also came back. We have a lot of quality players right now, but the question is, who should start. What would be the best formation to play with, and who should be dropped. So far it seems like Mastantuono will be dropped, but that means playing with 4 midfielders. Which has proven to be good before, but I don\u2019t know if that is Xabi\u2019s style. Valverde, Mbappe, Tchoumeni and Bellingham seem to be the fixed players that have to start in important games. And now Guler is also an important piece. What do you think would be the best formation for this. ",
