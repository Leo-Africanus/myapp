And I hope more of our fans will start appreciating Kroos and Modric even more. Courtois, saved us from yet another humiliation despite one blunder.\n\nMany of these players are avg or above avg, Kroos and Modric made them look world class, but the truth is these guys are barely above average, as soon as Valverde was asked to do more technical stuff, his form dropped.\n\nVini? Do I even need to explain, \"I'll do it 10 times if I have to.\" These were the words that he spoke after losing the Ballon d'or when the entire club backed him and now he is can't even bother taking constructive criticism for Xabi and demanding Ronaldo level contract when he is not even in the same universe. He is not even 1/4th of the player he was.\n\nVini and Bellingham literally missed two open chances, I don't even know what to say.

        "content": "Imho Xabi pulled a materclass today in tactics considering we\u2019re playing Man City with this many injuries especially in the defense. Without Mbappe, Huijsen, Trent, Militao, and Camavinga we were able to press really good and that was reflected on the chances we created and control we had on the match. We\u2019re playing a good Man City side yet we were head to head with them for most of the match despite our struggles on and off the field.\n\nTwo brain dead decisions from Rudiger and absolutely terrible finishing from Vini and Jude cost us the game.\n\nXavi needs to implement his vision with the players he wants. We\u2019re building a team to be able to win more trophies, and we need to trust him with that. We didn\u2019t bring him as a caretaker coach. \n\nWe pressed better today and that showed us results. Imagine if we pressed like this in recent games we played?? Why didn\u2019t we? Apparently we can.\n\nSell the players that are rebelling against his tactics and replace them with ones passionate about this club. For now, move Mbappe to the left and try GG in the 9 spot and play Arda in his fav spot in the center.",

When has Vini expressed discomfort with xabi after the Barca incident, when has Jude e expressed discomfort with xabi, when has valverde expressed discomfort with xabi. Why is this stupid gossip coming from. All our players are frustrated, but they never openly criticized xabi. They all are going through tough time but they all are 100% with him in this. They pressed today, they pressed against Bilbao, they pressed Barca. They are with xabi in his ideas. Vini presses Bellingham presses. Only against low block teams they suffer and they take it easy which xabi needs to fix. People hear act like they know these players actions behind the scenes. They act like Vini stepped out and talking shit like salah on slot. These Vini fans and mbappe fans and arda stans need to leave this sub or shut up. Let xabi sort it out and give him some time instead of fanning the flames. ",

        "content": "I\u2019ve never seen Bernabeu this nervous before match and as the game went on the fans started to turn on players.\n\nXabi was pushing players forward all game long, but barely anyone paid attention.\n\nPlayers don\u2019t help each other, don\u2019t try to pass for the runs. A lot of walking. There is no leader on the pitch and no one to control tempo. Gonzalo barely touched ball as no one played to him.\n\nThe board saw last years problem as signed 3 defenders and TAA to play the balls. It\u2019s better team than last year.\n\nI still think sacking Xabi won\u2019t accomplish anything other than empower players, but at the same time, if they lost all respect, you can\u2019t keep the coach as much as I like Xabi over some of the players. \n\nUltimately the fault is on board. There is no leader on the pitch, there is no tempo controller. You can\u2019t really play without anyone in the box. Even Endrick almost scored a header\u2026\n\nThe board bought all top young take talent and it didn\u2019t work out. It happens, I can forgive that. The problem is how to get rid of some of the players. Who was last established player we sold? Casemiro 5 years ago? \n\nWe should build the team around Mbappe. Decide if wanna play Jude as a 10 and play 4-4-2 diamond and Mbappe as LW with a classic 9 or 4-3-3 and move Jude back. But how to you get rid of big contracts that run for next 3 years?\n\n",
