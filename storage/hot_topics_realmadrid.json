        "content": "Every other day, I see our fanbase saying something harsh about Carlo and it breaks my heart. I understand some people never liked the brand of football he offered and last season in particular. I hear you guys. But acting like he was good for nothing and a big problem is such a harsh way to see him.\n\nBut let\u2019s be fair to him please.. On his first stint, he cane to Madrid from PSG when we weren\u2019t at our best. We had won one league title in 5 years and it seemed like we were never gonna win La Decima. He was the manager to finally deliver the league title to PSG and had unlimited money to push for CL there. He came over and he delivered the biggest night in the club history this century. And the reward he got- unfairly dackedyfor Rafa freaking Benitez next season. All the players publicly said they wanted him to stay.. Did he ever say anything bad about us? Nope, he said he is a Madridista just like us.\n\n2022- Zidane had just quit. Real Madrid were struggling to find a manager. Even Max Allegri snubbed us having said yes before. Who comes to the rescue? Carlo Ancelotti. And what does he do? Win us the Champions League against all odds and the league title too. Remember how far away we seemed from the CL title in 2021? And he does it again the best GK in the world, 2 starting CBs out with ACL and no striker other than Joselu..\n\nYes he had bad moments and difficult times.. Is some of his criticism fair? Yes, absolutely.. Does he deserve the abuse we give him? Absolutely not! He came from Milan and became a Madridista. He is very vocal about it. We owe so much to him. And above all, he was a gentleman. He is my favorite manager along with Zidane. Gracias Carlo \u2764\ufe0f",

        "content": "With Liverpool deal collapsed, I think we should scoop in for him for Summer by locking the deal in January. With Rudiger not getting younger and I don't remember last time Alaba had a proper game ,he brings in the perfect match for Dean. He is excellent one-on-one, good at heading and very commanding defender. Ascencio, Dean and him with Rudiger as a sub for next season might be the right defensive choice for CD. ",

        "content": "Scaloni spoke exclusive to Flashscore and Mastantuono was on of the topics.\n\nHere is the part:\n\n**Franco Mastantuono made his debut in\u00a0Real Madrid\u00a0and revolutionised everything. How did you see all this evolution that he had until he arrived in the white team and all this process that he is going through?**\n\n\"Franco's situation is a bit similar to that of Nico Paz. He is a very young boy, even younger than Nico, who has taken a giant step in his career, to a club that is huge, and all in due time.\n\n\"Luckily, his coach understands him, he knows very well what is there, and they are going to take him in the way they see fit. Let's not forget how old he is, let's not forget the step he's taken, and I think Real Madrid are aware of that and they're going to take him in the way they see he can move up. Let's understand that he is a young boy and that he needs to adapt.\n\n\"We, as a coaching staff, believe in his possibilities, and as far as we think it's convenient and that he can contribute, we will use him. And if we see that it's not yet the right time, we'll do that too, but it's clear that he has a huge future ahead of him.\n\n**Do you see him mature at the age of 18, and that he really feels football as if he has always played for Real Madrid, in these first matches?**\n\n\"Yes, he is a boy who shows maturity, he shows that he wants to learn, and it is clear that he has fantastic conditions and that he has to exploit them, as long as the club, his teammates and the coach understand that he is 18 years old.",
