        "content": "This guy is unbelievable. I lost count how many times we were pissing down our leg in the back and when we finally get the ball to him, this guy whips it a crazy distance across the pitch with insane accuracy to beat the press. Not to mention his ability to instantly change the situation, literally one second the opposing team is on the attack, trent stops it, and sends it down the other end of the pitch to vini or mbappe the next. His ability to immediately shift the situation from us stopping their attack, to the cbs chasing vini or mbappe from recieving a trent pass in mere seconds is unlike anything the rest europe currently has to offer.  \n\nAfter his injury recovery im assuming he wasnt 100% fit up until recently. but speaking strictly before then (before the marseille injury), when he was alternating starts with Dani, idek how this guy was sitting on bench, or wtf Xabi was seeing in practice. because everything i've seen on the pitch from him has solved a large amount of our ball progression out the back and has formed a sort of band-aid over the fact that we still lack a deep-lying playmaking MF atm. \n\nI get ppl have reservations about his defensive awareness, but as far as I care, he hasnt made any huge defensive blunder in a madrid shirt. maybe a few lapses, but those happen to any defender. And those would only continue to decrease as we continue to get guys back from injury and strengthen our backline in the upcoming summer. Especially playing alongside guys like tchouameni/fede. \n\n  \nTLDR: this guy is gonna be a generational pick up for us",

We have Guler who has shown to be amazing at passing and vision. We have the best player in the world at the moment in Mbappe, paired with the best GK in the world. Our LB is capable of playing CB and has shown to be really solid. We have a really physically and ball wining CDM in Tchoumeni who balances our midfield. We have a lot of quality and it was shown today in the first half. Xabi just needs to get things right, and let\u2019s not forget a bunch of our squad was injured. If we sign a proper 9 who can take advantage of Trent and Vini\u2019s crosses, and we sign a world class defender, we could possibly be one of the best teams. A number 9 with the crosses that Trent and Vini can deliver would just be insane. There is a lot to be positive for, let\u2019s hope Xabi knows how to manage the team, hala madrid!  ",

We need to take at least 2 wins in the next 3 games. \n\nI hope we can do our best in the Manchester City game, so we could focus more on the liga games, especially Barca isn't in a good place in UCL now.  They got 7 points and have to fight hard to avoid playoff round.\n\nWe aren't in a very bad position in both liga and UCL, but certainly the team's structure needs a lot of works.",
