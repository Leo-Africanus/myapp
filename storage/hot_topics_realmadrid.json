        "content": "Mbappe on the field is loved solely for his goals, nothing else ,and that's normal, he's a striker, a number 9.\nFrom an objective point of view, if you don't specifically watch Real Madrid matches, it's impossible to say that Real Madrid is not\n lucky to have someone who scores so many goals.And many Real Madrid fans are just happy to have him because he scores a lot of goals.\n\nBut for some people who watch the matches, it just creates a lot of frustration. \nThese people also like him for his goals and nothing else, but every time he's not in the area where he could have scored, he creates this frustration. \nThis situation happens very often; these people don't hate Mbappe, they're just extremely frustrated by what he doesn't do and what they think he could easily do. \nWhen they see Mbappe dribbling in midfield like Anelka, even though they only admire him for his goals,  or, seeing him far from a position where he could score, when they only like him for his goals, creates a lot of frustration. \n\nThose people don't really hate Mbappe, they're just very frustrated, and frustration can breed hatred. \n\nBeing number 9 is surely the position where it's hardest to be liked when you want to do something different \nFor other positions, it's easier to be liked; for example, if a winger makes a difference and makes good passes, he'll be liked, if a defender recovers a lot of balls, he'll be liked,And it's much harder to score than to make good passes, dribble, or make defensive plays.Because goals are much rarer than dribbles, good passes, or other things, but also because in modern football, it's a defensive advantage; It's easier to defend than to score.\n\nIn my opinion, I think Mbappe is the kind of person who was born with an aptitude for difficult things but struggles with simple things.\nOr maybe he really doesn't know how to play as a number 9, because basically 90% of the goals he's scored this season he could have scored if he played as a winger. (Don't imagine he'll play winger; if he wanted to play winger, he'd play winger for the national team) \nI'm frustrated too because he has everything but is stuck at 50% of what he could do. \nHe has a much better ball-handling technique than most number 9s, but when he plays as a number 10 or a false 9, his technique is very average compared to the false 9 and the number 10.\nHe easily scores 50 goals in a season with few tap in, whereas for most number 9s, tap in account for almost 50% of their goals. \nHe's not good with his head, even though he's not short. \nHe's not good with his back to goal, he's not a good target man, he doesn't have good positioning as a number 9... This player is too frustrating. \nIn my opinion, if he had good positioning as a number 9 and put in a lot of tap in, he could potentially surpass Messi's goalscoring record. There are like 20 more matches than before, and in a World Cup or European Cup year, it's not impossible \n\n\nI forgot to mention the year he made the world believe he was going to come on a free transfer and then extended his contract with PSG, but I think for most people, that's forgotten/forgiven. \nOtherwise, for those who are obsessed with Mbappe, I'm only talking about football.Mbappe seems like a nice guy off the pitch, and having a charity that helps sick children is a great thing. \n\nWe just have to hope for more tap in for Mbappe.",

        "content": "I guess we'll find him dragging the defenders to his nearest ball holding teammate instead of making runs and creating chances, effectively limiting his options to do anything.\n\nOr worse, like this case, complain about a perfect chance not being turned into a back pass for him to dribble into a defender and lose the ball \n\nI repeat he may be a great goal scorer but thats all he has to offer and it's simply not enough, he isn't fit for this team Ancelotti knew it and that's why he asked for a true 9 in Kane. \n\nI mean, why does he offer that we didn't have before? Goals? We had Joselu ona fraction of everything Mbappe has and still delivered those regularly. \n\nCreating chances? Lol, lmfao even. \nBut anyway, we had Vini and Rodrygo handing those out like hot cakes. \n\nHis first touch is mediocre, his deibbling atrocious, his passing mediocre, his off the ball movement? Non-existent.\n\nMaybe Benzema raised the bar too high, but I expect the 9 that palys for Real Madrid to be perfect in all the above mentioned aspects. \n\nTwerked for 5 years  befor joining just to drag down the entire team's chemistry  and to do what? Bring 40 goals a season? I'd rather have Joselu and his 20+ goals (mind you, as a sub) and team's perfectly balanced than whatever this is.  Either he improves or hopefully gets sold. \n\nMind you I'm not saying he's the only culprit, but the other get plenty of criticism already, this dude got away for so long with his bs. First season was \"not judge to hastily\"  now for the most part, up until like 3 games ago  the scapegoat was Vinicius.  When will it be enough? \n\nDude ghost the entire game, we play in 10 v 11 for 80 min, the he scores a random goal (possibly a pen earned by someone else hard work, probably the aforementioned Vinicius) and almost everyone forgets he made Casper look like and amateur for the entirety of the match.

        "title": "Some interesting quotes from Ancelotti\u2019s book \u201cThe Dream: Breaking Champions League Records\u201d",
        "content": "Let me begin by saying I don\u2019t necessarily agree or disagree with the quotes; I just found them interesting to highlight given the current state of the team.\n\nAbout Joselu and strikers:\n\n&gt;What happened next was something that can happen to even the best goalkeepers in such high-pressure games. Vin\u00edcius had been giving Kimmich a hard time all game but had nothing to show for it. Now he tried a hopeful shot from just outside the area, which pitched just in front of Manuel Neuer. Unbelievably, one of the best goalkeepers in the world, who had already made several saves, allowed the ball to bounce off his chest straight into the path of Joselu, who was following up as all strikers are meant to.\n\nAbout the 2023/24 squad (I found this very interesting because of all the problems we are currently having, and because Don Carlo talks about all his Champions Leagues in the book, so he could\u2019ve said this about any of the teams he was a part of; yet he chose define this specific squad as it follows):\n\n&gt;What I loved about this squad was the lack of big egos. They were a humble group who were easy to manage, no matter how much money they were paid or how many trophies they\u2019d won. Or how old or young they were. And they worked hard. Both of these qualities are, for me, non-negotiable.\n\nDavide explaining his father\u2019s way of coaching (from the final against Dortmund):\n\n&gt;On the touchline we had decided that there had to be change because Dortmund had been the better team. The manager doesn\u2019t necessarily impose a solution. I think it was more like a sort of a question that he posed to the group, like, \u2018What if we switch a little bit, like it's because I think we have this problem, but do you agree \u2014 do you agree with this idea?\u2019 He thought the problem was that we were overloaded in midfield, so we needed to change the system and go with three midfielders, to switch to a 4-3-3, Bellingham, Kroos, Camavinga. So, he \\[Bellingham\\] would hold on to that left side of the midfield and Vinicius to hold wide on the left with Valverde on the right and Rodrygo as a nine. This would give us stability.  \nThat was the conversation at half-time. It was from a discussion around the manager\u2019s thoughts and with the input of the key players, the captain \\[Nacho\\], also the senior players, like Carvajal and Kroos. Their view was that we needed one more player in midfield. Kroos said that we couldn\u2019t press them, which meant that we had to wait a little bit back. This feedback made the manager adjust his idea a little bit. As a result of the initial discussion, he built on the idea and made slight adjustments and then represented the idea so that it came from the group, and he asked the group if they agreed, and they agreed.\n\nBellingham about Carlo (and maybe Xabi?):\n\n&gt;He will never waste time on the basic things you should already know. He doesn\u2019t waste any time with that. It\u2019s really concise. It\u2019s like exactly what you need, and that for me, is key. Keep it simple. For example, tactically, it ultimately comes down to simplicity for Carlo \u2014 get the defensive structure right, I have a team where we\u2019ll score goals. If you keep a zero, we\u2019ll win the game \u2014 simple as that.  \nI feel like some modern coaches come with so many instructions because they feel like they\u2019ve got to do more than other coaches. They almost want to be puppet masters.\n\nSome bits and pieces about 2024/25 (Kroos, Modric, Mbapp\u00e9, Asencio and injuries):\n\n&gt;There was excitement at the arrival of one of the world\u2019s best players, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, but there was also the disappointment of losing the quality, experience and leadership provided by Toni Kroos and Nacho. We would also have to closely monitor the playing time of Luka Modric, although at times he did not seem to need a rest. It was particularly difficult to lose Kroos. At 34 he was still in his prime and was the controller of the team\u2019s rhythm.\n\n&gt;But as the reigning champions and with the high expectations of the fans, the media and pretty much everybody else, it was thought that by adding Mbapp\u00e9 to an already Champion team, things could only get better. I still thought that with a little luck we had the quality to carry on where we had left off and fulfil the expectations being heaped upon us. But it turned out that we weren\u2019t that lucky. Very quickly, Dani Carvajal and \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o joined Alaba as long-term absentees, although on the plus side, it did enable us to call up Ra\u00fal Asencio, a 21-year-old academy graduate, proved himself as a genuine first-choice option alongside R\u00fcdiger.\n\n&gt;We worked hard to rebalance the team that had become unbalanced by the injury absences of Carvajal, Alaba and Milit\u00e3o in particular. Players such as Lucas V\u00e1zquez, Tchoua-m\u00e9ni, Bellingham and the ever-dependable Valverde all had to play in unfamiliar roles to help the team. To their credit they all knuckled down without complaint.\n\nWhat do those say about the current team? I don\u2019t know. Maybe everything, maybe nothing. Agree or disagree, it\u2019s at least interesting to see an inside (albeit biased, for sure) perspective of things.\n\nEdit: formatting",

        "content": "Full Writeup: **Martin Samuel \u2013 The Times: It's not just Jose Mourinho \u2014 abuse of Vinicius Jr has been enabled at every level | Real Madrid star has been subjected to racism on several occasions in Spain \u2014 Mourinho's reaction to his allegations against Gianluca Prestianni is not the first of its kind** \n\nWhy did Jos\u00e9 Mourinho feel entitled to speak that way about Vin\u00edcius Jr? He was enabled, as others have been before him. Enabled by Uefa, by the Spanish league, by tame local media, by all the figures in authority who, across many years, could have ended this, but did not. It\u2019s not just about Mourinho, it\u2019s about Javier Tebas; it\u2019s not just about Benfica, it\u2019s about Porto, too. What Vin\u00edcius claimed occurred last week at the Est\u00e1dio da Luz has been going on for years; because those with power have allowed it to happen. \n\nIt would be easier to list the grounds in Spain where Vin\u00edcius hasn\u2019t been racially abused, but here are a few where he has: Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Valencia, Albacete, Real Mallorca,\u00a0Real Valladolid, Real Sociedad, Getafe, Osasuna, Real Betis and Sevilla. Since 2021, La Liga has logged 26 different racist incidents involving Vin\u00edcius at 11 distinct stadiums. Sometimes the trouble is brought to his home. In January 2023, a dummy dressed as the player was found hanging from a bridge near Real Madrid\u2019s training ground. Four Atletico fans received suspended prison sentences for this affront, more than two years later. \n\nYet the year Vin\u00edcius was hung in effigy was also the year Tebas, the La Liga president, was forced to apologise for his reaction to the player\u2019s threat to leave the field at the Mestalla, after being subjected to monkey chants by Valencia fans. When Vin\u00edcius said it was a problem he was encountering across Spain, Tebas went on the defensive. \u201cBefore you criticise and insult La Liga, you need to inform yourself well, Vini Jr. Don\u2019t let yourself be manipulated,\u201d he posted on social media, his instinct being to protect the brand. \u201cI think that the message, and the intention I had, was not understood by a significant number,\u201d he later clarified. \u201cIf I hurt someone, if they thought I was racist, it\u2019s far from reality.\u201d \n\nWhat is reality, however, is that Mourinho\u2019s reaction, in which he sought to blame Vin\u00edcius\u2019s goal celebration for what may have been a \u00adracist tirade from one of his Benfica players \u2014 Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 alleges that he heard Gianluca Prestianni use the word \u201cmonkey\u201d towards Vin\u00edcius five times \u2014 is not the first of its kind. In 2022, Pedro Bravo, the president of Spain\u2019s association of football agents, went even further. \u201cYou have to respect your rivals,\u201d he told the television show\u00a0*El Chiringuito*. \u201cIf you want to dance samba, go to a sambodromo in Brazil. Here you have to respect your colleagues, and stop acting like a monkey.\u201d Not a fool, not a clown; a monkey. You know what Freud would say about that dismal serving of word association? Naturally, a clarification followed. \u201cIt always ends with an apology and \u2018I was misinterpreted,\u2019 \u201d Vin\u00edcius commented, ruefully. \n\nYet this isn\u2019t his problem alone. While Vin\u00edcius attracts a disproportionate number of racist incidents compared to other black players, he is not the first to struggle to get his case heard. In March 2024, the Spanish third-tier team Rayo Majadahonda walked off during a game with Sestao River, in protest that their goalkeeper was being racially abused. The Spanish federation punished the accusers, not the abusers, with a 3-0 defeat, a three-point deduction and a \u20ac3,000 fine. Later that year, Christantus Uche, a Nigerian playing for Getafe at the time, gave an interview complaining about racism. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand, he can\u2019t say that,\u201d the Getafe president, \u00c1ngel Torres, said. \u201cWhen he has been here for one or two years and understands Spanish, he can say whatever he wants.\u201d Uche decided not to test this and signed for Crystal Palace. \n\nWind back to 2011-12, the season Manchester City made their first appearance in the modern Champions League. Knocked out at the group stage and dropped to the Europa League, they drew Porto. City were new to this. During the match, their executives thought they heard an ugly sound. It seemed to erupt every time Mario Balotelli or Yaya Tour\u00e9 were on the ball. Fearing inexperience in the European game, and not wishing to offend their hosts, they first checked with the travelling press pack that the noise was what they thought it was. The press, then Balotelli, confirmed it. City complained to Uefa, whose match representatives were uninterested, and their hosts were indeed offended. Porto\u2019s executives behaved as if City were just troublemaking newcomers unused to the big stage. Ultimately, Porto were fined a paltry \u00a316,000 by Uefa. In the next round, City were a minute late back onto the pitch against Sporting Lisbon and fined \u00a324,000. \n\nEuropean football is littered with instances like that. Messengers shot, complainants ridiculed. It was always the English press who were accused of stirring controversy by asking awkward questions after matches. It happened in Bulgaria in 2019. A local cameraman told the England manager Gareth Southgate to f\\*\\*\\* off as he left the room, having fielded questions about racist chanting during a European Championship qualifier. Bulgarian journalists laughed when the subject was raised. Thankfully, there is now a Uefa protocol around racist incidents and at least it was applied last week in Lisbon. But Vin\u00edcius may have to line up against Prestianni again on Wednesday because Uefa investigations move about as fast as law enforcement officers investigating brutalised protesters on the streets of Minneapolis. \n\nAnd media are culpable, too. It was May 2023 when Vin\u00edcius confronted fans at Valencia, accusing them of calling him a monkey. A case went to court in October that year and Vin\u00edcius gave evidence. After misreporting of his words, Valencia insisted he apologised. The local newspaper, Superdeporte, produced a front page with his picture and a long, superimposed, nose. \u201cPINOCHIUS\u201d, read the headline. Soon after the trial, Vin\u00edcius again excelled in a Champions League match against Sporting Braga, all sparkle and step-overs. \u201cIt\u2019s not racism, he deserves a slap for being a clown,\u201d Miquel Camps, a Barcelona board member, posted on social media. \n\nNobody should think tackling racism is easy. Liam Rosenior, Chelsea\u2019s head coach, was asked about the Vin\u00edcius incident and its fallout, and said that any coach or player found guilty of racism \u201cshouldn\u2019t be in the game\u201d. This was interpreted as a call for a life ban on Prestianni if the accusations were proven. Yet proven to what level? In football, a balance of probabilities is often enough to get a guilty verdict. But can, or should, a career be ended on that? John Terry was found guilty of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand this way, but the same case in Westminster magistrates\u2019 court ended in acquittal. Might that happen to Prestianni with need for a greater burden of proof? He covered his mouth with his shirt so couldn\u2019t be lip-read, and Benfica claim Mbapp\u00e9 was too far away to have heard what was said. Uefa may be able to rule given the balance of probability but, if the penalty was a life ban, would surely need to meet more exacting standards. Any hearing could then just deteriorate into he said, she said, with no verdict at the end. The higher the penalty, the more concrete the proof required. \n\nWhat is undeniable, however, is that Vin\u00edcius and others like him have been poorly served. Mourinho spoke as he did because he knew he could; because others had done so before him and got away with it. We may never know what Prestianni uttered beneath the protection of his collar. We can presume, however, that it may hardly be worse than what is often permitted to occur around Vin\u00edcius, very much in plain sight. ",

Reason why Henderson,Fabinho ,Milner and wijnaldum all worked for him. Most of his creativity at Liverpool came from his fullbacks and guess what we have Trent already and Carreras has the ability to also create . Bellingham and valverde will enjoy klopp more than any manager . He loves his midfielders being all action back and forth in games . As I said the only problem is vini and mbappe pressing . Klopp will look at them and immediately reject us because these guys will not be willing to press . Just look at how Salah,Mane and firmino thrived while being pressing machines . Klopp is both a manager and coach together . He is friends to the players he coached and also tactically good. Yes our players will be tired by the 80th minute but if we play like that we will be mostly leading 3-0 before then.",
