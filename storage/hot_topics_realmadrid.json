I have read that tickets for games that are not el clasico, Madrid derby etc you can usually get at the stadium the day of. Is that a true statement still? I have seen tickets for sale on sites like StubHub or viagogo, are those sold by season ticket holders? Because I know the tickets don\u2019t usually go on sale until the week of, unless you get the hospitality tickets. I see tickets for around $300 to sit in the middle of the stadium which is what I would be interested in, but is that a fair price to pay? Or should I rather wait until I\u2019m there?\n\nIf anyone has went to a game last season, any input would be appreciated. ",

They reinforced their squad and it seems they are gonna sign Isak aswell, a player that would be perfect for our club. \n\nimo, it would be a crazy achievement from Xabi if we manage to have an amazing season and I hope that the fans and the board don't blame Xabi cuz he doesnt have the players he wants for the footbal he wants to play.",

And to spice it up sold Rodrygo for 75M to Bayern, and sold Ascensio to Leverkusen for 35M, Lunin to Brentford fo 15M, and Carvajal to Saudi or MLS for 10M. Maybe even loan out Endrick to wherever Nunez might be going. \n\nThat's a lot of outgoings of fan favorite players. I'm curious what the consensus is.",

Worth it to pay the extra for Rodri?\n\nEdit: remove the first \u201dplayed\u201d in the title. My bad:/\n\nEdit: never mind as someone commented, the months between CR7s departure and Modric winning it, we played without a balon d\u2019or winner",

        "content": "Both of them have scored in 2 winning CL finals. Vini has had more years in the club but I guess for the first 3 years he wasn\u2019t at his current level, whereas Bale was already world class when he came. Both of them have had their detractors as well from our fans.\n\nVini would be my choice, he\u2019s had more impact in the team ever since he broke out. \n",

        "content": "At This Rate Rodrygo Is Going to Leave on Deadline Day. The way this transfer saga has unfolded it has indicated a few things. For one that Rodrygo is going to leave the club the signs were there as early \"Don't Forget the R\" propaganda last summer/early fall. As soon as I saw Rodrygo getting benched in the CWC I knew it was over. Xabi was sending a message and it breaks my heart. \n\nThe other fact is that Rodrygo is nowhere near a move right now depsite rumors being hot all summer. Imo the best fit for him was Bayern and they overpaid for Diaz instead. Liverpool has already spent a lot and currently going for Isak. Then you got Arsenal who seems to have opted for a RW backup and other bench pieces instead of a bona fide starter at LW instead. \n\nHonestly idk how Al Hilal hasn't swooped in and even offered half or 75% of what they were offering to Real Madrid and Vini. I think the club would accept that in a heartbeat and it might turn Rodrygo's head. I mean its turning Vini's. ",
