It is a forward-biased award, but outside the forwards he has been the best. An absolute rock in defence, great ball carrying and crossing, and even scoring in key matches. He was even the best player in that World Cup semifinalist Moroccan team. The man is class from every angle and would have locked down our back line for a decade. I wish him the best but it is hard to see him play in blue when it should be in white.",

How do you explain that? What were the keys to winning this European Cup?\n\n\"One of the keys was tactics, from the quarter-finals right through to the final. We changed a few things. We tried to strengthen our full-backs, to give Michel Salgado and Roberto Carlos more freedom, so we played with three experienced central defenders. Then we had a midfielder in front, a player like Fernando Redondo, who needed to be on his own, to handle and control the ball.\n\n\"In the end, we adapted perfectly to the players we had. We gave Raul freedom... In short, I think we were lucky to have a good group and we gradually led them towards a common goal, trying to move them in the right direction so that we became a team.\"",
