        "title": "Ancelotti, Endrick and the youngsters",
        "content": "Ancelotti has been criticised for the few opportunities he gives to youngsters and here is my point of view\n\nThis is not new for the coach There was the same controversy with Arda Guler last season in 21/22 I remember that there were many complaints with the management of Valverde and Camavinga and that is that they did not play at all, if you remember CMK would play until the end with changes of 2 minutes at most \n\nIt is not until the tie with PSG where in the first leg we are embarrassed, but some events occur Casemiro is suspended for accumulation of yellow cards and Kross seems to arrive with discomfort, in the return with PSG, without Casemiro he puts Valverde, Modric and Kross still injured, we continue to be subjected by PSG until they change Kross and Ascensio for Camavinga and Rodrygo changes that would become constant in the 14th, \n\nIt is not to the point where he has no other choice but to give Valverde and Camavinga a chance, who easily dominate the PSG midfield and most of the rivals we would face, which was contrary to the performance of the CMK that was subdued by any top team in Europe, but despite this, this mythical midfielder remains intact until the following season where we play the European Super Cup with the CMK and the first league games until Casemiro decides to go to United, because Tchouameni and Camavinga would not even smell the field without this\n\nbut why does he do this? Ancelotti has his way of leadership or managing the squad and he does not want problems, the veterans, those who have weight in the locker room, the expensive signing or the one with a high salary are going to have priority, In the elimination at the Etihad, despite Rudiger's incredible performance, he put Alaba in for the return match despite the fact that he had just recovered from an injury. In the Super Cup and the classics of that season, he was very insistent with Modric and Kross together and he changed Camavinga or Tochouameni despite the fact that Barca physically surpassed that combination. \n\nbut it is because he does not want problems because the players get angry, on the field Kross has made faces, Modric leaked his discontent last season to the press, Rodrygo has made faces and created a scandal because the newspaper Marca omitted him from the photo with Mbappe, Belli and Vini and Ancelotti in his vision is to please the big names of the club, this is his vision of leadership, it applies to the rest of the squad, because he continued and continues to call up players of a similar level to play in the first division, see Hazard, Vallejo, Bale, Isco, Mariano, Marcelo, why would it be better to have Miguel Gutierrez than Marcelo or the next squad level where we don't have Medy and we had to play with Camavinga in that position? Miguel did play for Real, he made a mistake against Sheriff and was never called up again. Wouldn't it be better to have Nico Paz this season? He might have scored a goal in the UCL and disappeared. \n\nI don't want to belittle Ancelotti's achievements, he's there for a reason. Managing a dressing room isn't easy. Many coaches would lose the team in a short time, especially those who like to be protagonists (Ten Hag) but also he is the worst type of coache for this moment in Real Madrid, a time when the board makes do with what they have, they don't renew or sign various positions on the field, a time when half the team was a veteran of the 3 Champions Leagues and you needed to renew yourself and make a transition and where you are with a long calendar where you need to maximize your resources but as we see Ancelotti voluntarily shortens them, Even if the youth team or a promising youngster were better than Luca Vazquez, he will not put him in because that would bother the current captain of the team",

        "content": "I\u2019m writing from Croatia, and I\u2019m interested in attending the Real Madrid - Las Palmas match on January 19, 2025. I would like to know the procedure for purchasing tickets. Is it best to buy tickets through Real Madrid\u2019s official website or from another platform?\n\nAlso, how quickly do tickets usually sell out? Should I buy them now, or can I wait a bit longer? What is the procedure for entering the stadium, and how early would you recommend arriving before the match starts?\n\nSince it will be my first time visiting Spain and Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, I would appreciate any useful tips or advice that might help make the experience smoother.\n\nThank you in advance!",

No Madrid fan would ever call them a legend but they really put in a shift \n\nThe most conspicuous name I have for the current is Brahmin Diaz. Very tidy player. Very skillful and almost unbeatable on his day.\n\nThe other ones I can think of are Savio, who was always entertaining, Steve McManaman and Guti (although I guess he may be viewed as a legend to some)\n\nCan you tell me of any more of this type?\nI'm obviously not talking about the Raul's and Zidanes etc",

I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll like the match or is it a useless one ? As I\u2019m not very knowledgeable in football and I remember how sometimes he would skip some match but never a Real Madrid one. Anyway the thing is I bought the tickets on 1boxoffice, costed around 600\u20ac for category 1 premium, is it good enough ? Like he won\u2019t be too far ? Also it says the ticket are gonna be received 24h prior to the match, isn\u2019t it too short? Has someone bought ticket on the website and had a great experience? I\u2019m sorry I have too many questions but I\u2019m so new to this",
