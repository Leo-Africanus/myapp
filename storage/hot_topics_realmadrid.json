And for the third time, it's a stupid loss of possession, this time by Pitarch while dribbling... Quick counter attack again, de Miguel's deflected shot is saved, but Enric Gallego just slides in, anticipating the rebound, and the ball rolls over the line... Careless and reckless performance against the strongest team in the league, but like this we would've lost against any team... \n\n40' - another goal on the counter for Tenerife, but it was offside\n\n\u26bd 42' - GOLLLL DEL CASTILLA - beautiful combination by Thiago Pitarch and Manuel \u00c1ngel, and Thiago keeps calm and squares it again in the box to Loren, who only needs to pass it into the net\n\n45'+4 - penalty for Castilla after a foul on Loren, given after a lengthy review! \n\n45'+5 - Palacios takes it low, and the keeper saves... \n\nHT - spectacular first half, in which it was mostly boys vs. men for Castilla, getting obliterated on the counter - at the end of the first half, they started fighting back out of nowhere, but Palacios sadly didn't take the chance to completely get them back into this match just before half time\n\n46' - second half underway\n\n\u26bd 46' - GOLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - beautiful all-team buildup after kickoff, Cestero plays it out to David - Palacios makes a brilliant dummy run, coming towards the pass instead, takes a touch past the defender and then finishes perfectly low into the far corner - the game is back on for the second half! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 16:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Heliodoro Rodr\u00edguez L\u00f3pez, Santa Cruz de Tenerife \n\n**Referee**: Jorge T\u00e1rraga Lajara\n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 1, Matchday 21\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[LaLiga+](https://www.laligaplus.laliga.com/) (subscription - 14.99\u20ac/month) (only available in Spain)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-3-3): Fran Gonz\u00e1lez - Diego Aguado, V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as \u2018Valde\u2019, Joan Mart\u00ednez, David Jim\u00e9nez - Jorge Cestero, Manuel \u00c1ngel, Thiago Pitarch - C\u00e9sar Palacios, Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez\n\nBench: Guille S\u00fanico (GK), Jes\u00fas Fortea, Lamini Fati, Mario Rivas, Cristian David, Dani Mesonero, Bruno Iglesias, Pol Fortuny, \u00c1lvaro Leiva, \u00c1lvaro Gin\u00e9s. \n\nUnavailable: Manu Serrano (injury), Roberto Mart\u00edn (injury), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Rachad Fettal (injury). \n\nCoach: Juli\u00e1n L\u00f3pez de Lerma\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** DLWLD\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 5th | 32pt | 10-2-8 | 26:26\n",

Arbeloa's last three matches have gone really well. Starting XI is starting to form an identity and the combinations are clicking as he would have desired. But he was lucky with the suspension of Carreras and the injury of Rodrygo to find his preferred combinations where he slotted Camavinga as LB and Mastantuono as RW against Monaco - a match that proved to be our biggest win and our best performance of the last two seasons.\n\nYesterday, Tchouameni's suspension ensured that the dynamism of Camavinga was there on the pitch. Mastantuono's work ethic and pressing strengths are becoming indispensible to the team. \n\nHow do you think Arbeloa will find a way?",
