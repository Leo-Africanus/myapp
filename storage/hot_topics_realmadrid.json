        "title": "Why this is a oversimplified take on our project so far",
        "content": "I\u2019ve been an avid fan of Managing Madrid for a long time, and I\u2019ve always appreciated Kiyan\u2019s articulate way of breaking things down \u2014 he\u2019s largely responsible for getting me interested in the tactical side of football. Over time, as I\u2019ve learned more about the game, I\u2019ve realized that my eye test has often been fairly accurate in predicting how things will unfold.\n\nWhen we signed Kylian last season, most fans were over the moon, but I was somewhat apprehensive. My concern wasn\u2019t about Kylian himself, but rather that we hadn\u2019t yet found anyone capable of replicating Toni Kroos\u2019s profile \u2014 both on and off the ball. That unease, I think, was shared by many fans and was a recurring theme during Carlo\u2019s final season. It wasn\u2019t rocket science; the imbalance was visible. So, naturally, I was very curious to see how things would develop in Xabi\u2019s first season \u2014 and I\u2019d say it\u2019s gone pretty much as I expected.\n\nOur biggest strength was always the individual quality within the squad. Xabi\u2019s job was to build a framework \u2014 a system \u2014 that could sustain us against well-organized teams able to exploit our weaknesses and craft tactical plans around them. To summarize: Xabi has introduced a pressing structure for when we lose possession, and he keeps our players close together in passing triangles to ensure we always have an outlet under pressure. The intensity of our press varies depending on the opponent, and we alternate between a back three and a back four when defending. The overarching idea is clear \u2014 dominate the ball for as long as possible.\n\nTransfers have been smart and targeted; every summer signing fits the profile we needed. It wasn\u2019t a perfect window, but it was close. The results have been excellent. We\u2019ve dominated most opponents, Thibaut\u2019s workload has dropped significantly, and as Kiyan pointed out, the standout game remains the one at the Metropolitano. That match \u2014 and what Kiyan wrote about it \u2014 is what I want to discuss here. Kiyan wrote:\n\n&gt;  \n*\u201cReminder: There is no such thing as replacing Kroos and Modric. You pivot, secure the best assets possible, and develop what you have. That in part is what is already underway: G\u00fcler has been given the keys to turn into Real Madrid\u2019s midfield magician, and with Bellingham back, they should get enough two-way balance \u2014 especially with a high pressing scheme.\u201d*\n\nI completely agree \u2014 there\u2019s no replacing what Modric and Kroos did for us. Matching their consistency and influence over so many years would be nearly impossible for any player. And we\u2019re not going to find ready-made clones of them on the market either. So trusting our current midfielders is the logical step forward. Jude has shown he\u2019s a generational talent, and Arda\u2019s following the same trajectory. Naturally, the plan should be to play both and prepare them to inherit those roles in time. Simple enough, right?\n\nI\u2019ve always believed that midfield balance defines elite teams more than anything else. Get it right, and you set yourself up for sustained success. Any great modern side \u2014 whether Pep\u2019s Barcelona or Zidane\u2019s Madrid \u2014 proves this. But I also think this balance fundamentally depends on having a double pivot of exceptionally gifted controllers.\n\nNow, by \u201ccontrollers,\u201d I don\u2019t just mean players who are technically excellent or good dribblers \u2014 that\u2019s a common misconception. Arda and Jude both meet those criteria, but being a controller is more than that. Controllers are the rhythm-setters, players who read the tempo of a match and influence the game for the entire team. They position themselves perfectly, adapt to the opposition\u2019s approach, and dictate the pace of play.\n\nLook at the top Champions League contenders this season: PSG have Vitinha and Neves, Barcelona have Pedri and De Jong, Bayern have Kimmich and Pavlovi\u0107. All of them are comfortable in any type of game \u2014 whether facing a low block or an open, chaotic contest. They can play possession-based football or go direct when needed. Their positional awareness and composure allow them to handle physical games, often operating in zones close to their centre-backs.\n\nThere\u2019s a misconception in how we discuss \u201cprogression\u201d in midfield. People tend to project individual traits onto roles: Arda can hit those technical long passes like Kroos, so he\u2019s seen as his successor; Jude can break lines with his athleticism, so he\u2019s the next Modric. But that\u2019s the issue \u2014 those are partial overlaps, not functional replacements.\n\nTake Vitinha\u2019s performance in the Champions League final, for instance. He attempted far fewer long passes than you\u2019d expect from someone of his ability, yet he was the most influential player across every phase of play. That\u2019s the essence of a controller \u2014 someone who can run a game entirely on his own. Naturally, opponents will try to design their game plans to neutralize players like that. This is where the second controller \u2014 someone like Neves, De Jong, or, Modric \u2014 becomes vital. They alternate between attacking and defensive duties, share comparable technical quality, and capitalize on the attention the other draws to keep the team\u2019s rhythm intact. The third midfielder then acts as a balancer \u2014 someone more attack-oriented like Ruiz, or more defensive-minded like Casemiro. But the foundation of control, the heartbeat of the system, always lies in those two primary controllers. \n\nA common criticism of this line of thinking goes something like: *\u201cOther teams didn\u2019t have Modric or Kroos, and they didn\u2019t struggle.\u201d* But that actually proves the opposite \u2014 they didn\u2019t reach the same level of success we did.\n\nTake Liverpool, for example. They kept losing Champions League finals to us because our midfield was simply a level above theirs. Their setup was predictable \u2014 designed to maximize work rate, running, and athleticism. That\u2019s why they thrived in the chaotic, high-tempo environment of the Premier League but struggled against us. We slowed the game down to our rhythm, and they couldn\u2019t cope.\n\nNow look at Arsenal. Arteta has tried to solve the midfield control problem by reinforcing the defense. It\u2019s made them hard to score against, but the trade-off is that they often play too conservatively, even when the opposition is there for the taking. You can see it this season \u2014 they dominate mid-table sides but tend to just hang on for results against top teams.\n\nAnd that brings me to my main point: we have a great squad, but a fixed XI won\u2019t cut it against teams that can switch game states on the fly. Our current tactical framework works brilliantly against midtable opponents because it neutralizes their structure and turns games into battles of individual quality \u2014 something we\u2019ll almost always win. But against elite opponents who know how we\u2019ll approach the game, that predictability becomes a weakness. \n\nArda and Jude are both 10s, but they interpret the role in very different ways. Arda\u2019s the archetypal central attacking midfielder \u2014 think \u00d6zil, James, or \u00d8degaard \u2014 someone who thrives on vision, timing, and the perfect final pass. Jude, on the other hand, reminds me more of players like M\u00fcller or Ferm\u00edn \u2014 late runners into the box, constant goal threats, always sniffing out space.\n\nBoth can defend well and are comfortable with the ball at their feet, but to truly unlock their potential, they need the right supporting cast around them. That balance \u2014 finding the players who complement their styles \u2014 will ultimately be the difference between us being contenders and actually winning everything in the years ahead.",

        "content": "Real Madrid are stepping up plans towards a radical change in their ownership structure \u2014 one that would allow external investors to purchase stakes in the club for the very first time.\n\nMadrid have been owned by their socios (club members) since being founded in 1902 and any adjustments to that model would require them to approve it in a vote. Only three other clubs have the same structure in Spanish football \u2014 Athletic Club, Osasuna and Barcelona.\n\nMadrid are the only club in world football to have recorded revenues over \u20ac1billion (\u00a3870million; $1.2bn), a total reached over the 2023-24 season according to a Deloitte report (\u20ac1.045.5bn was the exact figure).\n\nDespite this, Madrid\u2019s president, Florentino Perez, has spoken about how being owned by members holds them back in certain ways, especially when competing in the transfer market with rival clubs backed by billionaires or sovereign wealth funds.\n\nPerez, 78, first mentioned the possibility of holding a \u201creferendum\u201d about changes to Madrid\u2019s ownership structure at the club\u2019s annual general assembly last year \u2014 changes that would allow investment from outside partners while still retaining control for the members, although no concrete proposals were shared.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the situation \u2014 who, like all cited here, asked to speak anonymously as they did not have permission to comment \u2014 Madrid\u2019s president is now set to present new details and further plans to move towards these changes at the upcoming general assembly for 2025. No date has been set for the event, but it is expected to be held before the end of November.\n\nOne idea that has already been discussed internally would see Real Madrid being effectively split into two different entities \u2014 separating the football side from the business side. In this way, socios would still technically retain ownership, while investors would be invited to purchase shares in the club\u2019s business operations.\n\nThe so-called 50+1 model, the Bundesliga ownership rule designed to ensure members retain a majority stake in clubs, has also been discussed both inside and outside the Bernabeu.\n\nThe full and final details of what would be a very complex operation for tax and legal reasons are still being worked out, sources said. But there is growing anticipation inside and outside the club that the coming weeks could mark the onset of historic change at the Santiago Bernabeu.\n\nWhat is Madrid\u2019s ownership model?\n\nAll Spanish sports clubs were member-owned until the early 1990s, when the national government mandated that professional teams be converted into a special type of private company called sociedades anonimas deportivas (sporting limited companies).\n\nMadrid were among four clubs given special dispensation to remain as they were \u2014 along with Barcelona, Athletic and Osasuna.\n\nThese four are all very proud of their special status, which involves democratic processes, including members electing the club\u2019s president, approving (or not) annual accounts, and voting on changes to club statutes at assemblies that must be held once a year.\n\nHow does it work? \n\nUnder the current rules, only the children or grandchildren of Madrid socios can apply to become Madrid socios. And just a select number of the club\u2019s 100,000 or so members are allowed to vote at the annual assembly. These are called socios compromisarios (delegate members). They number around 2,000 and are chosen in a vote in which all members can participate.\n\nStill, Madrid\u2019s governance model is integral to the club\u2019s self-image, although few doubt that Perez has been the most influential in setting policy during his two spells as president (2000-2006 and since 2009). Compared to the three other socio-owned clubs in La Liga, Madrid\u2019s assemblies feature very little public dissent. The board\u2019s plans are almost always voted through by a large majority of delegates.\n\nIn 2012, changes to the club\u2019s statutes mandating that any presidential candidate must have been a socio for at least 20 years, and must provide a guarantee of 15 per cent of the club\u2019s annual budget (this was \u20ac1.1bn for 2024-25), were voted through with 997 votes in favour, 100 against, and 15 abstentions.\n\nMore recently, proposals that allowed the club to partner with U.S. investment companies to finance the expensive Bernabeu rebuild were also voted through by compromisarios with similarly large majorities.\n\nWhat external partners do Madrid already have?\n\nThe approximate \u20ac1.8billion cost of the refurbished Bernabeu \u2014 along with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic \u2014 led Madrid to look for outside financial support in recent years.\n\nIn 2017, they agreed a deal with the U.S. private equity group Providence, receiving \u20ac200m in exchange for a share of future sponsorship revenues. In 2021, that deal was renegotiated, with another \u20ac50m provided.\n\nIn May 2022, U.S. investor Sixth Street provided \u20ac360m in funding for the Bernabeu rebuild. That deal saw a 20-year partnership run through a joint venture containing all of Madrid\u2019s in-stadium income, with the exception of season-ticket sales.\n\nStadium management specialist Legends \u2014 in which Sixth Street are majority shareholders \u2014 also partnered with Madrid to run the club\u2019s retail operations and all the Bernabeu\u2019s restaurants and bars. A separate \u2018Bernabeu\u2019 company and brand has also been established to manage all the club\u2019s \u2018non-football\u2019 activities, from Taylor Swift concerts to an NFL game and corporate events.\n\nHow has Perez been preparing the ground for change?\n\nPerez has often argued that his first priority is to protect Madrid\u2019s socio-owned model, and that this motivates his regular battles with La Liga and UEFA, as well as his continued promotion of a European Super League.\n\nBut he has also spoken about how the socio model makes it more difficult to compete with other top European clubs whose owners can more easily inject money directly into their teams.\n\nHe mentioned all the above again at Madrid\u2019s November 2024 assembly, while making what was a surprise announcement of a potential future vote on changes to how the club was governed and owned.\n\n\u201cI confirm to you that we will bring to this assembly a proposal for the club\u2019s corporate reorganisation that clearly secures our future, protects us from the threats we face, and, above all, guarantees that we, the members, are true owners of our club, real and full owners of our economic assets,\u201d Perez said.\n\n\u201cAnd, of course, introducing the necessary elements so that effective control of the club always remains in the hands of its members. It will be all of us members who, in a referendum, will decide our destiny together.\u201d\n\nNot much has been said in public since then by Perez about this referendum, or what the question might be. But the Bernabeu hierarchy are well aware of the value of their club. One source suggested Madrid could be worth as much as \u20ac10billion \u2014 the same as the Dallas Cowboys, the NFL\u2019s most valuable franchise.\n\nWhat might happen now?\n\nMultiple sources have told The Athletic that the Madrid hierarchy, along with close advisors at Key Capital Partners and the law firm Clifford Chance (both of whom played key roles in the failed European Super League), have been discussing possible new ownership models that would allow for external investment while also keeping as much control as possible with the club\u2019s socios.\n\nHowever, it still remains unclear exactly what direction the club will now take.\n\nOne idea is to split Madrid into two entities \u2014 one covering football and the other the club\u2019s business. In this scenario, Madrid would be able to invite investors to buy stakes in their business side (such as TV rights or stadium revenues), while ownership of the club would legally remain in the hands of the socios through its charitable foundation.\n\nBut how this would work in practice, and how it would match up to Spanish corporate and tax law, has proved difficult to finalise. It is also a very sensitive topic and would be controversial among at least some Madrid supporters.\n\nThe option of allowing members to sell their share, perhaps yielding windfalls of somewhere between \u20ac50,000- \u20ac100,000, was discussed internally but has now been taken off the table, sources say.\n\nAnother challenge, this time from a potential investor\u2019s perspective, is that many Bernabeu season tickets currently cost less than the price of most VIP packages for just one game. For an external investor, fewer local socios, and more one-off visitors to the stadium, would be preferable. But those local socios are Perez\u2019s power base, and keeping them happy is a big priority for him.\n\nAlso, sources familiar with Madrid\u2019s internal discussions say that the current hierarchy wants to ensure that decisions such as hiring or firing the coach and player transfers would always be made by the board, which is ultimately answerable to the socios.\n\nA potentially more palatable option for Madrid\u2019s board and socios is something closer to the Bundesliga\u2019s 50+1 rule, in which club members always retain a majority (50 per cent plus one vote) of decision-making power.\n\nBut again, it is not clear how the club\u2019s ownership structure could move towards this without encountering significant complications; for the current leadership, the socios and potential investors. One industry source also suggested that the 49 per cent on offer to external investors in this scenario would be made less appealing by the lack of control it would bring \u2014 meaning it would therefore be badly monetised.\n\nPerez has always been very clear that he does not want a situation where any outsiders could take control of Real Madrid. \u201cNobody should be able to sweet-talk their way into control,\u201d he told socios back in 2012. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to think bad of anyone, not of Arab sheikhs or Russians, but this is our own thing.\u201d\n\nNo matter what new model is chosen, any money raised from investors would go into the club: to strengthen the team, or go towards paying the Bernabeu redevelopment costs.\n\nNobody is going to \u2018cash out\u2019, and Perez himself does not stand to benefit financially. The 78-year-old, who has been attending games at the Bernabeu since the 1950s, is looking for a way to retain control in the short term, while safeguarding the club\u2019s competitiveness at the top level far into the future.\n\nWhatever is decided, some kind of change in Madrid\u2019s club model is coming, and has been in preparation for some time.\n\nHow exactly to find the right balance between different interests involved \u2014 lifelong fans, current directors, future investors \u2014 remains to be seen. The devil could be in the details of whatever final plan is eventually put to socios to vote on.",

        "title": "Ask Me Anything: Demystifying - Florentino Perez is rumored to propose a new ownership structure in the next general assembly of Real Madrid. I have been studying the financial reports of Real Madrid for half a decade, and read every article about this rumor. Ask me any question about it.",
        "content": "Some of my previous work here on the subreddit: https://old.reddit.com/r/realmadrid/comments/1eb16sw/oc_in_depth_overview_and_consequences_of_real/\n\nI have keen interest in financial systems, and have researched extensively on the subject of the new ownership change at Real Madrid.\n\nIt has its pros as well as its cons. Lets start with what is current ownership structure of Real Madrid:\n\n1. Real Madrid is fully owned by its members (socios) - 100% ownership where they pay an annual fee of membership upto a certain age after which it becomes free.\n\n2. Its nearly impossible for anyone to become socio unless they get the membership transferred from their family member (parents, grandparents) to them.\n\n3. Socios vote on the assembly for various resolutions just like it happens in any shareholder meeting of a public listed company.\n\n4. Socios vote every term for a president who takes control of the club and manages its operations.\n\n5. President does not make a single penny for his job and runs the board only for the welfare of the club. They do not own the club. \n\n6. Real Madrid needs to run self sustainably manner because there is nobody to inject capital or do a fund raise if a crisis or catastrophe hits the club (example COVID, when Madrid had to sell players without buying anyone for years)\n\n7. Barcelona have the same exact structure, and runs on the same principles. The only difference is that they have a limit on president running for consecutive terms, as well as the minimum budget that needs to be put as collateral can be shared by all board members.\n\nNew ownership structure proposed:\n\n1. Real Madrid will issue shares and convert the club from 100% ownership to a hypothetical 50+1 structure akin to Bayern Munich.\n\n2. Let this be clear: Real Madrid will still be majority controlled by the socios, there is not a shadow of doubt about it. Everything remains as same as above, only the new difference is the ability to raise capital.\n\n3. Now the club has the option to raise capital by offering upto 49% equity of the company that will be established. \n\n4. Club doesn't needs to offer 49% in one-go, they can opt for something as low as 5% for 500M euros at 10B valuation or simply do not raise any capital at all.\n\n5. In all possibility, this will be the case. Real Madrid will not offer any shares at all. Its just a backup insurance in case a crisis hits the club.\n\n6. If for some reason club does offer shares, all of the proceeds will go directly to the club. No - Perez, JAS, Saudi, Socios, no-one can use the proceeds, only the club can use it for its own needs.\n\n7. If the club comes up with a expansion plan that needs heavy capital with associated risk - only then would Madrid offer its equity and even still at very low amounts.\n\n---\n\nSo in essence,\n\nFlorentino Perez wants to safeguard Real Madrid's financial health for the future. Club has near 0 net debt (most of the 1.1B debt is tied with Bernabeu renovations which is already generating 350M of income and average interest rates are as low as 3% which is less than the inflation rate itself!)\n\nClub has rebuilt a sensational young team and still generates healthy 250M EBITDA each year that can be used for buying new players. There's 0 need of any fresh capital unless club comes up with a huge expansion plan.\n\n---\n\nPros:\n\n1. Real Madrid gains an enormous financial leverage as the club can raise upto 49% of equity which at 10B valuation is close to 4.9B euros if any need arrives in the future.\n\n2. Real Madrid gain huge financial transparency for the future that will stop from a Bartomeu situation to ever occur since the club will have to adhere with stricter financial rules and have to answer to the minority investors if any fresh capital is raised in the future.\n\n3. Each socio gains an actual share to cement their legitimacy and can ask for more transparent financial disclosures again improving the corporate governance of the club.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Real Madrid ceases to be non-profit organisation on the day it raises capital because minority investors will want a financial incentive at the end of the day. If the synergies are well matched that it can overturned practically by leveraging the club's brand for the minority investor's gain. Bayern does this with Adidas, Allianz, Audi partnership.\n\n2. Socios's shares will get diluted everytime there's a fresh capital raise however - Club cannot raise capital without socios's approval and if they do, it will definitely be either to overcome a crisis or a huge expansion plan and in both cases - the shareholder value of socios will rise.\n\n3. There can be a divergence from sporting goals to financial goals if the structure is not setup well and any minority investor of the future is allowed in without proper due diligence.\n\n---\n\nTLDR: Real Madrid will be employing a high risk - high reward planning with this new structure. On hand they gain an enormous financial security and leverage for the future but with great power comes great responsibility.\n\nI welcome the idea but have some cynicism on how the fund raise will happen if ever - My ideal world would be to convert to 50+1 but do not raise any fresh capital and continue running the club as it is with multi-folds higher level of corporate governance and financial transparency in post-Perez world to ensure our next president is as pure to the cause and not there just for corruption or financial rewards.\n\nThe 49% backup equity shall only be touched in a case of extreme crisis to give the club a new chance and even still no more than 5% equity shall ever be diluted in a single round at any point of time.\n\nEverything else runs as it has always been running.\n\n\nNow any questions? Feel free to drop them below and I will try my best to answer it to best of my abilities!",
