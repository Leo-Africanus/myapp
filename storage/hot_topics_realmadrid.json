A player can be good and still not fit a team. Mbappe is essentially a winger. He\u2019ll never be a striker because he does not play like that.\n\nWe payed a massive bonus to a player who we did not need, and we have also given him so much priority. If we had a striker like Ekitike or Kane (closest thing to Benzema) we would have someone to run in the box. Someone to support play, and to take advantage of Vini\u2019s and Trent\u2019s crosses. I honestly see no way we start consistently playing well as a team without a 9. This is obviously not the only problem, our defense and midfield need improvement. But, It is crazy we dropped around 120 million just as a bonus, on a player we didn\u2019t even need. We shot ourselves in the foot.",

My concern is how he fits this team structurally.\n\nUsing the Osasuna match as an example, Madrid often looked like they were playing with 10 men in possession. There was no consistent presence in the box, attacks had no central reference point, and too often he stayed static or drifted into Vin\u00edcius\u2019 zone instead of occupying defenders.\n\nWhen that happens:\n\n- the box is empty when crosses come in\n- Vini gets doubled more eeasil\n- transitions die because there\u2019s no focal point\n\nIt\u2019s not about effort or talent \u2014 it\u2019s about role overlap. Both he and Vini naturally attack from the left channel, and right now the team doesn\u2019t look structurally balanced when they share the pitch.\n\nHonestly, in some matches the team looks more coherent without him, which shouldn\u2019t be the case for a player of his level.\n\nIf Arbeloa (or the staff in general) doesn\u2019t address the positional discipline and attacking structure, I don\u2019t see Madrid winning anything this season \u2014 not because of individual quality, but because the system still feels unresolved.",

The ball simply ends up going out from the other end. I mean how much of \u2018analysis\u2019 does it take to understand a winger NEEDS a forward to score? Atp it\u2019s completely Vini dependence, he dribbles, he pressures, he traces back, he makes the crosses, and he should score. One game without form or bad luck and we drop points despite having world class players running back and forth playing like they\u2019ve never seen a ball. Mbappe is not at all present at the box, what else is his duty? He doesn\u2019t track back enough to at least mention a defensive support. Just a non existent forward passing the ball around. Trent is lovely with the through balls, but if there isn\u2019t anyone forward, to whom should he send a through? We CANNOT get ourselves to win placing all hopes on Vini alone.",

        "content": "THIS IS NOT, I REPEAT THIS IS NOT AN ATTACK ON EITHER OF THE 3 INDIVIDUALLY\n\nI am sure that tchouameni is world class, valverde is world class, camavinga has the potential to be world class. But not together, Real madrid starting camavinga and valverde in their midfield, thats the same player 3 times, its like expecting to win trophies with 3 Casemiros in your midfield. They are incredible at tracking and winning the ball back, and atleast valverde has the ability to create chances and generate output,\n\nBut camavinga and tchouameni mainly, Tchouameni has 0 g/a all, camaving has 1. \n\nBoth midfielders rank in the bottom 10% for chances created.   \nAdding valverde to this midfield, someone who again does not do much for chances created / assists just compounds the problem. Goals need to come from everywhere, and that doesnt mean getting rid of all 3, but these 3 cannot play in the same team.",
