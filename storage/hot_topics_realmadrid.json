        "content": "P.S. G.Garcia isnt on the app im using thats why fran is there. Only reason im suggesting this lineup is cause we cant keep mbappe as striker if we expect to suceed in the long run. I know mbappe is good but he just doesnt do what we need from a striker. I think G.Garcia should start so we can see more from him especially since this next game should be an easy win. I put mbappe on the rw cause he's clearly capable of playing there, not to sure of the midfield tho just wanted to see what you guys thought. Just tried to have a civil convo about my criticisms for madrid with a fellow fan on tiktok and he decided to be delusional and just respond with a pic of previous matches where we won against barca as if that's all this club should care about. He seemed to think that just cause we beat barca, we could beat anyone and win the ucl(even though it's very very obvious that id we keep playing the way we play against big teams, we are definitely not winning the ucl) Please feel free to share your thiughts WITHOUT being rude",

        "title": "About Mbapp\u00e9 and Anfield",
        "content": "Are some people seriously gonna blame Mbapp\u00e9 for recent mishaps??? It\u2019s just so pathetic, is born of player bias and indicates individual failure to recognise mistakes in Xabi\u2019s system. If you watched the build up out of the back at Anfield, it is clear to see a massive errors from how the team set up against Liverpool. As easily as you can blame Mbapp\u00e9, you can blame Vinicius for the loss. But we shouldn\u2019t dwell on such minute matters and instead look at the bigger picture to gain better insight into our problems in the big matches. However, it must be disclosed that these are all in my personal opinion having watched the disaster at Anfield from start to end.\n\n1- To start off, there\u2019s a major problem in escaping presses. Xabi played Trent for a collective total of around 10 minutes in the last two games. His first game fully back from injury was in the most hostile environment in Anfield after his confidence is already being lowered by the starting of Carvajal and Valverde over him. To put it simply, if we don\u2019t play Trent at RB, who was brilliant as allowing Liverpool to escape pressing with his passing range, it just won\u2019t work. The clumping between Valverde, Camavinga and Militao was simply ridiculous at times. Valverde and Camavinga beng desperate to escape the pressure that they found themselves in, were to hit the long balls cross field because the short passing between themselves was going absolutely nowhere.\n\n2- The over reliance on Vinicius. We can\u2019t look for the left flank everytime to create chancesfor our team. Especially at Anfield he needs someone to help relieve pressure so he can play at his absolute best- which is genuinely unstoppable. He\u2019s such a good player but if you\u2019re dribbling the ball out of the game you need to get your head into the bloody game. I see so much criticism of Mbapp\u00e9 when we have Vinicius being given the keys to drive the offence forward against Liverpool and doing jackshit with the role. The diving was flamboyant and unnecessary, he needed to just get his head entirely into the game and not try any funny business.\n\n3- Only one of Bellingham or G\u00fcler should be playing in the middle, not both. Both players have extremely different styles of plays and different talents to offer in the attack but want to occupy the same area of the pitch in possession. I think playing both sacrifices the potency of one of them so it\u2019s an \u201ceither or\u201d situation.\n\n4- Misusing Tchouameni. All I will say is that it seems he is not being found during possession to relieve some pressure even when Xabi wants to pass out the back. We\u2019ve seen from endeavours with France that Tchouameni has the eye for the pass behind when he gets on the ball. Even if we want to pass out the back Tchouameni should be a pivot we turn to because he has the physicality to hold it up and the ability to pass it up the pitch.\n\n5- Horrible substitutions. Xabi should not be waiting until the 80th minute to start substituting players. In addition, the substitutions made no impact because they had no time to. Xabi needs to bring in Gonzalo Garcia or Endrick as well because both bring energy into the match. I can remember Garcia pressing his ass off to meet Barcelona players in their own half when Real Madrid were closing out the game. The importance of energetic presence cannot be understated on modern football and Mbapp\u00e9 and Vini cannot be expected to do such after 70 minutes.\n\n6- The press. Is there even a press in big matches??? Has Xabi told the forwards to save energy for non existent counter attacks? I believe one of Mbapp\u00e9 and Vinicius should be pressing in each defence and the role should be left up to them to decide in lieu of commanded rotation pre and mid match. \n\nTLDR: There are major changes that must be made to roles in personnel and system that have been negatively impacting performances on the big stage. It must be recognised and your mindset needs to change if you\u2019re still riding the Mbapp\u00e9 hate train.",

        "content": "Yes, 3 at the back is a very interesting approach, but this is the formation when the ball is in possession, or when we intend to play offensive. When the ball is with the opposition however, Valverde transforms to a RB, giving the side a back 4. To even out the left flank/wing defensively, Tchouameni lines up along side Vini for defensive assurance, while on the right Guler is able to add creativity and offensive input. For the attack, it's clear that our lack of target man hurts us, and before people talk about PSG not having a target man and still won the UCL, we play differently to them. Gonzalo Garcia will be the poacher, whilst Mbappe sits less deeper and assists in build-up.\n\nUltimately, yes I know I'm not Xabi, but you can't lie, I kinda cooked here.",

Those who watches the match will know how much ball progression And chances vini creates or try to create. He is still best LW in the world.\n\nIts not his fault we play differently now, cause crossing is a major tool of his skillset which we are unable to utilize properly.",

        "content": "  As no surprise to anyone, we are not in our best form right now. Although, I believe we will get much better. However, evidently there is a lack of something. Many claim we are missing a creative midfielder, while others claim we need a proper 9 in the box. I personally believe that the main issue is that we have too many similar profile players, especially in attack. We basically have three left wingers and no competent Right wingers. If I could bring someone, I would either bring a good right winger, or a proper 9 who can score set pieces which we lack so much. If you could bring someone, who would you bring? ",
