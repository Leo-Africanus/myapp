I feel bad for him because he had to go through racism, getting robbed off an award and now his form has dipped. Nonetheless, we can\u2019t just mindlessly support him and act like nothing happens. We can\u2019t just act like he didn\u2019t play horribly this year. But most importantly we can\u2019t ignore his attitude. I have no problem supporting a player during tough times. I would go far and more for Valverde. However, the problem with Vini is his behavior and ego. Vini is asking the club for more money and trying to shine over Mbappe. I think it is pretty evident by this time that Vini and Mbappe don\u2019t work together. If a player wants to be over the club and act un accordingly they can leave no matter who they are. On the other hand Rodrygo may be a worse player than Vini but has always played out of position for the club and been humble. I believe that Vini needs to stop being defended as much as he is. Every true Real Madrid fan knows no one is above the club.",

Take garcia for example always moving around getting into good positions that\u2019s why he got so many goals. Compared to vini who runs to the wings and Mbappe who stands still instead on constantly making runs and moving around. Not to mention if Dean and Trent aren\u2019t playing passing back to the defense is the same as giving the opposite team possession because they aren\u2019t capable of being calm and passing that ball back. I think midifled creativity and control really isn\u2019t the anywhere near as big of a problem as people think. I think it\u2019s the people surrounding them that needed the most improvement. But we still need stiller not only are we losing Bellingham we lost modric , Kroos, and possibly ceballos so we need depth and even once Jude is back assuming we play 4 mids we will have only 1 CM option of the bench. What are your opinions ? I personally think defense should be our biggest priority ",

        "content": "Just thinking back to that Champions League run in 2021/22 still gives me goosebumps. Honestly, sometimes I sit here and I *still* can't quite believe we pulled it off. Comeback after comeback... it felt like every single round was a movie script that no one would have dared to write because it seemed too unbelievable!\n\nFrom PSG to Chelsea, then that crazy City game, and finally lifting la Decimocuarta against Liverpool, each step felt like climbing a mountain. But our players... they left EVERYTHING on that pitch. They played with a spirit that was just unmatched.\n\nThere were moments where it felt like it was over, done. But this is Real Madrid, and somehow, some way, our boys found that extra gear, that bit of magic, to turn the impossible into reality. The Bernab\u00e9u was a cauldron, a true force of nature pushing the team forward.\n\nThat run wasn't just about winning; it was about the heart, the passion, the never-say-die attitude that defines our club. It\u2019s a reminder of what\u2019s possible when you wear that white shirt and fight until the very last second.\n\nEven now, years later, whenever I think about that incredible journey, it fills me with so much joy and a sense of limitless possibility for Real Madrid. What a team, what a spirit, what a run!",

        "content": "So we all saw the headlines and its stated everywhere now that Rodrygo is leaving. Which is possibly 90% true news.\n\n\nCan all disagree with this, but this could be a bad decision from Alonso. Rodrygo has a way higher work rate and trackback ability than the wingers we have right now. The way he creates chances and plays selflessly, and doesn't have a huge ego\n\nNot to forget that he also has better fluidity in passing which our players seems to be lacking for some reason and not to forget he is also at the right place at the right time like a target man.\nHe has/had his own bad days just like every other player but he had almost no chance to prove his worth in this team since Alonso came in, but there are certain players who aren't benched even when they make way more mistakes in multiple matches yet they aren't sold and eventually given a chance back. So why this discrimination with Rodrygo?\n\nAny team would be lucky to have our lad and I am happy to see him flourish anywhere but at the same time I am also not happy with the fact that we would miss out on a talent like him.\nHe might have confidence issues but he always fought for the badge.\n\nYou will always be one of my favourite player no matter where you go Rodrygo. An appreciation post+my opinion",

        "content": "Huijsen and \u00c1lvaro Carreras have both had a breakthrough season. Majority of football fans probably did not know how much talented these players are 2 years ago, they were able to show their worth this season. \n\nHuijsen is a master at carrying the ball, either with his pinpoint passes or with his feet. So is Carreras. \n\n[Among all fullbacks in his league](https://x.com/DataMB_/status/1943720247891997042), he has the most touches, most progressive actions, most passes completed, most forward passes completed, Most progressive passes completed, most accurate passes to final third...etc. Benfica literally played through him. \n\nI don't have this year's stats but last year he dwarfed everyone in his age bracket in [progressive actions](https://x.com/DataMB_/status/1840701634726216192) in the top 7 league. \n\nOn top of all of this, he has experience playing as a CB aswell, we could see him as an LCB in some games too. I can see him transition to a CB like Ramos too.\n\nWe should be very optimistic in regards to our backline, we have a master passer in trent on our RB, A master progressive player in Alvaro on the left and Dean in the middle.
