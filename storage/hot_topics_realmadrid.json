I mean whether you criticise, Jude, Mbappe, Valverde, Rodrygo, or Vini, you'll get hated no matter what. \n\nEveryone watched the game today and the way each of the superstars were disconnected from any semblance of the tactics, but these player FC fans will say that today was a great and hard-fought victory. \n\nI mean, yeah a relegation battling team is as scary as Barcelona or Bayern Munich. \n\nThe team literally won because of a penalty but these player FC fans will not consider this because Mbappe and Vini scored today.\n\nI've been watching Real Madrid since 2007, and pretty recently found this sub. I've seen the heartbreaks and the glory days during this 19 year period, but I must say that this team is the most disjointed in the history of our club. \n\nFor those who'll say that I'm from India and my opinion doesn't matter, I'll just tell you to piss off because you don't know the things that supporting this club got me while growing up. \n\nThis club and particularly San Iker helped me connect with football and seeing Ronny here at Real, pushed me to grow up as a person who never gives up, so I'm more of a Madridista than you fake guys who only support individual players and only want trophies as a glory hunter. \n\nEven if the mods delete this post, I'll still keep trying to criticise the worst batch of players that this club ever had.",

My favorite player is Valverde but I won\u2019t defend him for his performances this season. I used to defend Vinicius in the past years but it\u2019s indefensible now. I used to defend Bellingham performances but it\u2019s indefensible now. I used to attack mbappe for his start with Real Madrid but he\u2019s turned that around. How can you see Guler play really good and help the team but then you as a Bellingham fan attack him for the first mistake he makes.\n\nThere\u2019s something wrong with fans and it\u2019s gotten out of control. Either support the club or don\u2019t support at all. There are players that cannot be defended, yet their fans wait for the first opportunity for them to drop a good performances in 20 games to tell you how they\u2019re the best in the world. Stop.

Yet I\u2019m seeing many fans on Reddit and Twitter dismissing them as \u201cfake fans\u201d for doing so.\n\nThat reaction alone shows how far the standards at Real Madrid have fallen so low that we\u2019re now expected to applaud poor performances. This isn\u2019t Arsenal, where mediocrity is celebrated and our star player who is an attacker scores 5 goals a season and is considered world class. We aren't delusional.\n\nThese players are meant to be the best in the world, and if they\u2019re not showing a fighting spirit or performing to the club\u2019s standards, criticism is not only fair, it\u2019s necessary.\nGone are the days when Cristiano Ronaldo could score two goals and still get booed because his overall performance was poor and he was stat-padding. Now, players have become so entitled that being booed after months of underperforming is treated as betrayal. To the point where Vini can say he doesn\u2019t want to play for a club that boos him after one good performance.\nThat mindset is completely at odds with what Real Madrid has always stood for .",

        "content": "I\u2019m genuinely starting to find our games hard to watch \u2014 not because of results alone, but because of how predictable we\u2019ve become. At the moment, even average opposition seems comfortable defending against us.\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t about selling or benching one or two players. The problems feel structural:\n\n\u2013 Lack of on-field leadership\n\n\u2013 No clear tempo-setter in midfield\n\n\u2013 No proper defensive midfielder in the Casemiro mould\n\n\u2013 Shortage of experienced defenders due to injuries\n\n\u2013 Over-reliance on individual moments rather than collective play\n\n\n\n(Courtois excluded \u2014 he\u2019s still world class.)\n\n\n\nAttack:\n\nOur attacking structure is extremely one-sided. Against Rayo Vallecano, it felt like almost everything went through the left, which makes us very easy to defend against. Opponents overload Vini\u2019s side, block his inside lanes, and force him into repeated 1v2 or 1v3 situations.\n\nVini is a decisive player, but his decision-making hasn\u2019t been consistent. He often chooses the dribble over the pass, even when overlaps are available. That leads to lost possession and broken attacks. This isn\u2019t about scapegoating him \u2014 it\u2019s about balance.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t mind seeing Rodrygo start a few games to add variety and reduce predictability.\n\n\n\nMidfield:\n\nThe biggest issue for me is control. We don\u2019t have a natural tempo-setter right now.\n\n\n\nG\u00fcler shows flashes, but Ceballos deserves more minutes in games where we need calm and circulation. Starting G\u00fcler and Bellingham together sometimes feels unbalanced \u2014 both are attacking-minded and can end up occupying similar spaces.\n\nValverde\u2019s versatility is valuable, but he seems stretched thin. Whether it\u2019s CM, RM, or even RB, he\u2019s covering ground rather than dictating play.\n\nSome midfield setups I\u2019d like to see tried:\n\nOption 1:\n\n\u2013 Bellingham or G\u00fcler as the advanced midfielder\n\n\u2013 Tchouam\u00e9ni &amp; Camavinga behind them for structure\n\nOption 2:\n\n\u2013 G\u00fcler or Ceballos alongside Bellingham\n\n\u2013 One clear holding midfielder (Tchouam\u00e9ni or Camavinga)\n\n\n\nDefence:\n\nInjuries have obviously hurt us, but experience is becoming a serious issue. Carvajal, Milit\u00e3o, R\u00fcdiger, and Alaba have all missed significant time, and the constant changes have killed any sense of defensive continuity.\n\nR\u00fcdiger and Alaba are still useful players, but they\u2019re no longer at their physical peak. Carvajal\u2019s leadership and mentality remain important, even if his role needs to be carefully managed rather than relying on him week in, week out.\n\nThis is where Trent was supposed to make a difference. His absence has been a big setback. The idea of adding a defender who can progress the ball, switch play, and reduce our left-side dependency made sense on paper. When fit, he should help stretch teams horizontally and bring much-needed variation to our buildup.\n\nCarreras is improving and learning from mistakes, but his positional discipline is still inconsistent, and that has already cost us in transitions. Huijsen and Asencio clearly have potential, but expecting them to be reliable starters under pressure or during counterattacks feels premature at this stage.\n\n  \n\n\nI\u2019m not questioning the quality of the squad \u2014 there\u2019s enormous talent here. But right now, it feels like we\u2019re leaning too heavily on reputation and individual brilliance rather than building a clear collective identity.\n\nMadrid has always been about more than talent. It\u2019s about structure, personality, and responsibility. That\u2019s what I feel is missing.",
