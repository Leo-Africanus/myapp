He is Tier 2 mainly because of his closeness with Florentino Perez.\n\nMost voted comments:\n\n**\u00d3scar P\u00e9rez:** Vini is a good player. Fast, good in one-on-one situations... but in his position, the best is Mbapp\u00e9, and Vini doesn't accept that. Mbapp\u00e9 has been able to adapt to his position and continue performing at a high level, while Vini does whatever he feels like at any given moment. They say it's easier to get rid of one player than twenty-five... so maybe it's time to transfer Vini and address the team's needs.\n\n**Luis Serra:** When you indulge a child's every whim, overprotect them, always portray them as a victim, and never call them out on their bad behavior, they grow up to be an irresponsible, completely self-centered, arrogant, and conceited person, utterly lacking in self-awareness. The entire Real Madrid community\u2014the club, the fans, and the paid media\u2014you have created a monster that is now devouring you. Enjoy it.\n\n**Oscar Fernandez:** Whitewashing by Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix, after a call from Uncle Floren. You forgot to write that it's all, all, all Xabi Alonso's fault.",

        "content": "I find it funny that the people including myself that were pissed off at mbappe chasing that record. Some of these guys clearly hasn\u2019t seen cr7. Anytime Ronnie was chasing records he would be the most selfish and frustrating player at times, but nobody minded it as much because at the end of the day we win games when he scores. I\u2019m not saying mbappe is cr7 because he\u2019s no where near but it just reminded me of some of the times where he would get criticism because of it.",
