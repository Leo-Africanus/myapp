        "content": "People seriously need to calm down about this loss.\n\nYes, losing 4-0 to PSG hurts, but the overreactions are getting out of control. I\u2019ve seen people say Mbapp\u00e9 is the worst signing we\u2019ve made in the last years. Really? The same Mbapp\u00e9 who\u2019s had a goal or assist in every final since he joined? The same player who was basically carrying us in every El Cl\u00e1sico? Without him, some of those games would\u2019ve looked like 4-0 or 5-1 defeats. Even against City in the second leg, he was the only one who showed up and scored.\n\nAnd now people are turning on Arda G\u00fcler too, saying he can\u2019t start against top teams. This guy started five games during the Club World Cup and looked sharp. In this PSG game, he was thrown into a midfield where he was completely isolated. Bellingham couldn\u2019t do much either, and Valverde was played as a right-back. What exactly was G\u00fcler supposed to do?\n\nSame with Gonzalo Garc\u00eda. He played against arguably the best team in the world right now, in a side that\u2019s still finding itself. And people are already calling him not good enough? It\u2019s been a handful of games.\n\nThen there\u2019s Tchouam\u00e9ni. Suddenly he \u201ccan\u2019t perform against top teams\u201d? That makes no sense. The real issue wasn\u2019t the midfield or the attack \u2014 it was the defense. All four defenders had an off-day. Simple as that. We conceded goals through errors you\u2019d expect from Sunday league players.\n\nXabi Alonso\u2019s only been working with this squad for five games. Five. He was basically using last season\u2019s team, without his new signings. What exactly are people expecting? Miracles?\n\nThis is the best PSG team ever. This club is in their prime. No one\u2019s been able to touch them. And yet some fans are acting like this one result erases everything we\u2019ve done and all the potential this team still has.",

        "content": "Yesterday\u2019s 4-0 defeat to PSG was painful, no doubt. But honestly I think this loss might actually help us in the long run.\n\nThis game clearly exposed some of our weak spots  especially in defense and up front. I hope this pushes the club to fully utilize the transfer window. We need proper reinforcements not just backups, but solid starters.\n\nYes, we\u2019ve got Vini and Mbapp\u00e9, but let's be real: they\u2019re not center-forwards. They thrive as wingers. Sure, Mbapp\u00e9 scored tons last season, but when did those goals come? Against who? When it mattered most  vs Liverpool,  Arsenal, and nowPSG  he went missing.\n\nDid you notice yesterday how PSG\u2019s attackers pressed our keeper and center-backs constantly? Meanwhile, our front three were waiting for quick counters  but to counter, you need the ball first. PSG controlled possession and suffocated our build-up.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about blaming individuals. The CB error? It happens. But the overall system looked off  (not xabi's fault) and that\u2019s why I\u2019m hoping the club realizes we need a true striker, more depth in defense, and maybe a few others with the hunger to fight in games like these.\n\nJust my take. I know some may disagree  and that\u2019s totally fair. I just love this club and want us to improve from here.\n\nHala Madrid. \ud83e\udd0d",

        "content": "Tactically, I'm not worried one bit. Looking at PSG as an example, this is the same PSG which finished 15th, losing to Atletico, Bayern, Arsenal, drawing to fucking PSV. They were sitting below 24th spot a some point even. Fast forward to now, they are the best collective in the world, destroying teams left right and center. So, for us, it might take some time obviously, for Xabi to try things. Some might fail, we might even need a few more signings, but eventually, Xabi will have this team playing exactly the way he wants and it will be amazing. \n\nBut to me, his biggest challenge will be to bring us back to being the mentality monsters we were always praised for in the last 10 years or so. Last season up till now, this team seems absolutely lost the moment we concede 2 goals. Barcelona, Arsenal, PSG, etc, like clockwork. And it's not a Carlo thing, since the '22 was literally won on the backs of remontadas and '24 we were the most solid team in Europe with 2 losses all season. And it's not like we bought a fresh new team either, most of the guys who were there then, but n ow, they seem to almost click off the moment we go 2 goal down.\n\nThis is the thing Mourinho managed to instill in our squad from 2010 to 2013. That \"Never say die\" spirit. Which was then carried on by our core players, CR7, Benz, Modric, Kroos, Case, Carvajal. We might not win the game, but we'll make sure the team suffers and holds on for dear life until the final whistle. When a team took a 1-2 goal advantage, people would say they were lucky Madrid didn't comeback. Now, the moment we concede twice, might as well turn off the TV cause the rest of the game is gonna consist of us trying to survive not conceding more instead trying an actual comeback.\n\nI don't know how we went from mentality monsters for a decade straight, to wtv this garbage is right now in the span of a single year. We practically switched places with Barcelona at this point, cause the past season they managed to reverse god knows how many 2 goal deficits, including against us.\n\nWhat people called \"individual brilliance\" was actually not quite that. Just a collective understanding from a group of elite players telling each other \"WE'RE NOT LOSING TODAY, SO WE FIGHT TILL THE END, TOGETHER\". So yes, in my opinion, this will be the biggest challenge and probably the one which will determine if Xabi wins major trophies for us or not. Cause yes, there will be games where things go sideways. But what always made us special was the fact we ALWAYS reacted and put up one hell of a fight, till the final whistle. ",

People are forgetting how much better we played for every match before this other than maybe the first one for obvious reasons because it was his first match with the team. He hasn\u2019t been coaching them for long, and PSG is arguably the best team in the world right now and literally just won the champions league so it\u2019s expected that they will play incredibly well. \n\nXabi can try his best to improve the team but if the players keep playing like this and making lazy mistakes then there is not much he can do, he\u2019s not magic. Xabi isn\u2019t the problem the players are, which should be obvious but apparently some people think no after one bad game Xabi is a bad coach and worse than Carlo and the team is back to how they were last season. \n\nOn a positive, at least we have a bit more time before laliga",

RM implemented a new coach and System last month. Does RM have world class players yes, absolutely. Does RM need to do better? ABSOLUTELY!!! But idk can we see what the team looks like after 1 month? Can we see what they look like with players that actually play the position they are in? \n\nHere is what we know, Mbappe got his first start in the new system against the best team in the world. The young players (Garcia, Asensio, Arda) finally had growing pains against Prime competition and showed their age. Fede is a top 3 player itw as a CM, but maybe he shouldn\u2019t be playing against the best front 3 as a RB. 2 mistakes in the first 7 minutes changed the game immensely. Also, RM was missing key players, but players that were coming off major injuries, showed their class.\n\nTranquilo, RM are coming, and anyone who doubts that needs to go watch baseball.",

        "content": "Just wanted to see what you guys think about today's game. Extremely disappointing mistakes considering they are both professionals playing at the highest level in football and for one of the best teams to ever exist. \n\nRudiger was non existent in 3rd goal, apparently makes the same mistake in every pressure game . The mistake leading to 2nd goal , I don't even know what to say. \n\nEdit: A lot of people defending rudiger for what he did today? I have never seen a player miss a ball like that, NEVER let alone a starting CB for Real Madrid ! It shows how bad we have fallen! \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f And if you think Rudiger was elite last season, go watch the matches where we actually played decent teams, and count how many times he was caught off position, how many times has he tried to press someone and left space where a boeing could pass through, and how many of those caused us to concede goals ! Then we can have a conversation on how elite he has been and how he carried us last season! \n\nAny average CB would get the job done against smaller teams when most of the game is played in the opponent's half. True test comes when you play against an actual decent team and Rudiger was exposed in every one of these games last season. ",

        "content": "When PSG were drawn against Real Madrid, everyone expected a PSG win. They had prime Mbappe, Neymar, Messi, and Di Mar\u00eda. And us? We had Karim, a developing Vinicius, Modric, and Courtois. Our squad had flaws. Kroos was struggling, Casemiro wasn\u2019t sharp, and every time the ball neared Carvajal, we panicked. All our hopes were on Courtois, Modri\u0107, Vini, and of course, Benzema, the man carrying our attack since Ronaldo's departure.\n\nBut when the scoreboard read 0\u20132 in the 60th minute, all hope seemed lost. Madrid fans were chanting Mbappe's name instead of chanting our own players. Then came the moment that changed everything: a 17-minute hat-trick from the best player in the world that night which launched a campaign of goals and elite playmaking. Everyone talks about the Manchester City game and rightfully so but this game against PSG was just as legendary.\n\nStill, the headlines from CBS with Jamie, ESPN etc focused on PSG\u2019s collapse rather than the brilliance of Benzema, who scored a knockout-stage hat-trick while losing 0\u20132 in 17 minutes. He never got the praise he deserved, not even from Madrid fans, despite a better big-game resume than Suarez or Lewa without being the focal point of attack until 2019 and never being a traditional No. 9.",

        "content": "There's absolutely NO excuse for vini and mbappe to be losing the ball and then leaving the rest of the team to fend for themselves and just hope that they win it back and pass it to them for a counter attack. Mbappe is literally the FASTEST man on the pitch, if he was to track back and recover the ball after losing it, things would be perfect. This attitude from both of them is genuinely unbelievable to me, it literally makes no sense,they can't keep doing this. Also vini does actually defend sometimes but he's not consistent with it so I don't care anymore",

        "content": "This loss is more beneficial than negative in my opinion. It just reinforced the holes in our system. Here are my thoughts:\n\nMbappe is a great signing until he fully refuses to press. He needs to start pressing this season, everybody can give you 20 + goals/ season. Bellingham did it out of position. If he doesn\u2019t start pressing he\u2019ll be a cancer in the team system. \n\nVini Jr needs to regain his confidence. Idk what happened to him since he got robbed out of the ballon d\u2019or and the insecurities built up since that Valencia game, but he needs to work through it. \n\nBellingham needs to be a more effective box to box and match valverde\u2019s effort. If not he needs to be a more creative 8. \n\nAscencio is a raw CB and he needs more time. Maybe a loan somewhere, with Militao back. \n\nFran Garcia had a great tournament but he\u2019s not a long term solution. The back office knows that. That\u2019s why they are still pushing for Carreras. \n\nRudiguer has been a classic CB, he\u2019s getting older and we saw that the past season, but he\u2019s should be 3rd in the depth chart after Militao and huijsen \n\nRodrygo needs to work hard for his spot in the starting XI. Every spot should be up for grabs given the current circumstances, and this is his chance \n\nOn the plus side - Arda guler, Valverde, Trent, and Gonzalo can be Pilar\u2019s to a great season. Play the Militao, and carvajal comeback. \n",

        "content": "I understand madridistas trying to defend Vini, but let\u2019s be honest, he is NOT playing to his potential. I saw someone here talking about how he \u2018creates chances for other attackers by attracting presses\u2019.. but is he even able to pass the ball through the defenders? NO.\n\nHis game is so predictable that whenever someone passes the ball to him, it is known that he will try to make a run at the left flank, attempt a dribble against the defender who\u2019s marking him and FAIL. How many times has he been successful in doing this in 24/25? Maybe 10-15 times, make two players press him and the success rate goes even lower. No pressing, no involvement in playmaking\u2026 I am not against him, but I am only letting out what I have watched the entire season, the same thing has happened every game. Carlo didnt want to bench him because he was the star player for him which is understandable, but I expected Xabi to make Vini feel that he needs to improve, sadly, Rodrygo is the one who is suffering.\n\nVinicius played RW against PSG.. what did Xabi think before putting him against Nuno Mendes? anyways.. out of 21 touches, he lost the possession 7 times. 0 aerial duals won out of 5.\n\nRodrygo gets himself involved in the defence, atleast more than Vini. If you really wanted to shift the wings, why not play Rodrygo? He shouldn\u2019t leave this season, it will be a huge loss for the club, Vini and Rodrygo can play in rotation as RW, with Mbappe at LW and Gonzalo as ST. I don\u2019t see a problem. Please correct me if I said something wrong. Oh and, nothing against Xabi, he needs time for sure.",

Unrealistic dribbles and selfish shots like Jude and Mbappe\u2019s yesterday. Not covering each other when the ball is lost. \n\nAny combination of quality+pressure and we capitulate VERY quickly with goals and individual errors.\n\nLa Liga referees are not very good. This we know. But we know it. You can\u2019t sit on the floor and complain whilst we get countered, when you know that. We do this as many as 10x a game (I counted a couple times).\n\nWe were 10 mins from winning the Copa Final. We were 2-0 up in a title-decider. Both to our biggest rivals. We bottled it and lost on both occasions.\n\nThe pathetic keyboard-warrior nonsense we saw on Instagram after Arsenal thrashed us. Saying nothing is ALWAYS an option.\n\nHow many times do we concede first/early?\n\nDortmund: We were 2-0. What Cuoto did should have been a red, it wasn\u2019t given. So we lose all concentration, make 2 critical errors leading to a goal, a penalty and a red. We do self-pity in-game and we get rattled.\n\nIndividually, we have Vini and Mbappe providing no workrate, Rodrygo disappearing from the squad, and Jude. Jude standing there, hands-on-head, incredulous that his hero-ball was intercepted, whilst Barca took that ball and scored seconds later. 1-0 in the final. \n\nWhere would Rudiger be if not a footballer? Truly an idiot. THAT meltdown vs Barca was\u2019t passion. It was pathetic. 1 good season out of 3. Saudi please. \n\nWe have a manager that doesn\u2019t want excessive/unnecessary/high-risk dribbling but that doesn\u2019t stop Brahim, Mbappe and Vinicius doing it anyway. \n\nAll these things are CULTURAL. We are on very, very weak foundations. We didn\u2019t do the above because 2 attackers don\u2019t compliment each other, or because of a formation. It\u2019s WHO they are.\n\nHow do we fix it?",
