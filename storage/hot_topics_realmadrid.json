Taking his man on, making the right pass when it\u2019s there, finishing without overcomplicating it.\n\nThat confidence is back. You can see it in the way he runs at defenders. They look worried again.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m getting carried away\u2026 but this really feels like peak Vini again. Anyone else feel it or just me?",

        "title": "Let\u2019s stop talking about a new attacker",
        "content": "Guys we really need to stop talking about signing new attackers and start being realistic.\n\nWe have Gonzalo Garcia as a Mbappe backup and Endrick is coming back, who can also play RW if needed. On the left Vini Jr is basically undroppable. If he\u2019s out Mbappe can play there and in an emergency even Brahim, even though he\u2019s more of a right sided player.\n\nOn the right we have Mastantuono who can also rotate into CAM with Arda depending on the situation. Arda can play RW but he has clearly shown he\u2019s much better as a CAM. Like I said Brahim can play on the right too. Rodrygo as well and in my opinion he should start when he\u2019s fit. He can also cover the left. Even Valverde can be put on the wing sometimes.\n\nWe are not lacking depth or quality in attack at all. That\u2019s not our main issue.\n\nWhat we should really think about is a proper central midfielder. Someone who can control the tempo and distribute the ball. Tchouameni and Camavinga are more ball winners than actual playmakers. And honestly we might soon need a RB and CB replacement too because I don\u2019t know how long Carvajal and Alaba can keep performing at a reliable level.\n\nWe don\u2019t need another superstar. We need solid players for defensive and central positions who are fine with being on the bench sometimes and who help the team function. Players who know their role and don\u2019t care about headlines.\n\nAnd please let\u2019s stop the Mbappe or Vini has to leave discussions. Both should stay. The attack is not our biggest problem. We just need better chemistry and better coordinated runs up front/better positioning in general.\n\nThe real issues are further back in the squad in my opinion. The starting eleven doesn\u2019t need a huge overhaul, just smart reinforcements in the right positions.",
