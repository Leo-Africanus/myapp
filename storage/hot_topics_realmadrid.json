He takes a nice touch around the defender, and finishes elegantly, low into the far corner! \n\n\u26bd 27' - the lead did not last long, cross into the box that Rivas can't defend, Manu Serrano then loses the duel and the attacker can lay of the ball to Borja Valle, who can poach it past Navarro due to Rivas still being out of position from the header. There might have been a foul on Y\u00e1\u00f1ez just before the goal, but this absolutely stupid new challenge system doesn't have any clear images (as always), so the referee lets the goal stand\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 18:30 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio El Toral\u00edn, Ponferrada\n\n**Referee**: Manuel Garc\u00eda G\u00f3mez \n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 1, Matchday 6\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[LaLiga+](https://www.laligaplus.laliga.com/) (subscription - 14.99\u20ac/month) (only available in Spain)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-3-3): Javi Navarro - Manu Serrano, Mario Rivas, Joan Mart\u00ednez, David Jim\u00e9nez - Jorge Cestero, Manuel \u00c1ngel, Roberto Mart\u00edn - C\u00e9sar Palacios, Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez \n\nBench: Guille S\u00fanico (GK), \u00c1lvaro Lezcano, V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as, Dani Mesonero, Bruno Iglesias, Pol Fortuny, Gabri Castrelo. \n\nUnavailable: Fran Gonz\u00e1lez (U20 World Cup), Sergio Mestre (first team call-up), Diego Aguado (U20 World Cup), Lamini Fati (suspended), Jes\u00fas Fortea (U20 World Cup), Cristian David (U20 World Cup), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Rachad Fettal (injury). \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** WLLLL\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 18th | 3pt | 1-0-4 | 3:7\n",
