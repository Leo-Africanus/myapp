He has offers to leave the Bernab\u00e9u and has made them known to the white leaders. Some offers that will surely increase as the opening of the summer transfer market approaches.\n &gt; Lunin has lived some somewhat special seasons at Real Madrid. The previous one, took the white team to the final in London, but he did not play it, but the goalkeeper of the final was Courtois. The same has happened in the current one with the Copa del Rey. Lunin has played the entire tournament, but the Sevilla final was played by Courtois. Some situations that have caused Lunin to be thinking about leaving the white club.\n\n&gt; Coincidence or not, names of goalkeepers have already begun to emerge to reach Real Madrid next summer. Kepa can return to the Bernab\u00e9u if Lunin leaves, while Joan Garc\u00eda's name begins to sound very strong in Valdebebas.",

        "title": "Thoughts on the Club World Cup and Madrid\u2019s Current Transfer Rumors?",
        "content": "This season is almost over, and honestly, it\u2019s been one of the worst in a long time. We still have a small chance of winning La Liga, but the biggest issue is that all our starting defenders are injured. On top of that, most of the rumors we\u2019re hearing are about the club only targeting free agents, aside from \u00c1lvaro Carreras.\n\nAs a Spanish-speaking Madridista, I follow a lot of Spanish sources and YouTubers like Ram\u00f3n \u00c1lvarez de Mon, I\u00f1aki Angulo, Siro L\u00f3pez, Rub\u00e9n Mart\u00edn, etc. From what I\u2019m hearing, Madrid doesn\u2019t want to pay that much money for Dean Huijsen, and Chelsea is reportedly close to signing him. Madrid also isn\u2019t planning to make any signings before the Club World Cup, aside from possibly TAA, if an agreement with Liverpool can be reached. Some sources even say that the only potential signing before the tournament is Franco Mastantuono.\n\nThis Club World Cup is complicating transfer moves because I guess we\u2019ll need to offload players to sign new ones? And a few of them will likely be sold after the tournament ends, which makes it difficult for us to make signings before the Club World Cup. (Correct me if I\u2019m wrong)\n\nPersonally, I hope none of the rumors about us not making any signings before the tournament are true. But with how this club has been operating in recent seasons, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising. Personally and like many of us, I\u2019d like to see us go for Dean Huijsen and \u00c1lvaro Carreras. If it\u2019s not possible before the tournament, at least after it ends once we\u2019ve offloaded some players. I\u2019d also prefer bringing back Nico Paz and giving Arda G\u00fcler more minutes for the upcoming tournament and season, but attackers are the last thing we need right now. What we really need is defenders.\n\nI know a lot of us have mixed feelings about this Club World Cup. We\u2019re risking burning out our players for a money-hungry FIFA tournament that feels unnecessary. And if the rumors are true that we\u2019ll be going into it with an interim manager like Solari, that doesn\u2019t exactly raise expectations either. The best thing we could get from this is the prize money, if we win it, and the chance to be the first and only club to lift that trophy.\n\nWhat\u2019s y\u2019all take on all this? And how do you feel about the tournament? Curious to hear what you all think.",

        "title": "Top 10 Real Madrid Players of All Time",
        "content": "So I was having a discussion with my friend and we both were wondering who we wuld consider in the list of top 10 real madrid players of all time. So many legends have played for our club and given their all so it wuld be hard to come up with just 10 players but I still tried my best trying to include all the factors like trophies and performance.\n\n**1) Cristiano Ronaldo:** Madafaqa scored 450 goals and 120 assists in just 438 games for us so Ig that's enough to put him at the first place. He also gave us 4 ballon d'or worthy season in just the 9 seasons he spent at our club and is also our top scorer and third highester assist provider.\n\n**2) Alfredo Di Stefano:** He was the main man (alongside puskas) in our 5-peat in the european cup and defined our 1950s era and global identity. Without him the club would no be close to what it is right now.\n\n**3) Raul Gonzalez:** He is our third all time top scorer and has won 3x champions league and 6x la liga. He spent 16 years of his career playing for Real Madrid, becoming the holder for most appearances with the club (741). He has always been a madridsta in his heart and a lifelong leader\n\n**4) Sergio Ramos:** He is without doubt a top 10 player but I am not sure how much the rest of you wuld agree with his position being this high. For me tho he definitely deserves this spot. One of the much clutch players in our history (Scoring that 92:48 equalizer vs atletico or the only goal in 1-1 win after a penalty shootout in the ucl final 2016). Even without his defensive skills, he scored 101 goals for us while being a freaking defender. More that enough to be at the 4th spot for me.\n\n**5) Kareem Benzema:** 2nd Highest Scorer and 2nd Highest Assist provider, benzema was one of the most selfless player who despite being a striker wuld try to provide chances for ronaldo. However, our longtime unsung hero finally turned into a leader and Ballon d\u2019Or winner (2022).\n\n**6) Zinedine Zidane:** As a player you could argue zidane doesn't deserve to be this high but when you couple his managerial career he is undoubtedly one of the greatest football maestros to have worked under this club. 3 UCLs and 2 La Ligas in just 4 seasons including a historic three-peat xD plus that iconic ucl final goal.\n\n**7)** **Luka Modric**: A faithful servant of the club who won 6 champions league with us and is till going strong at 39\n\n**8) Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s:** He was a goalscoring machine who scored 242 goals in 262 games winning 3x european cup and 5x la liga titles. He had immense influence alongside di stefano\n\n**9) Roberto Carlos:** He scored 69 Goals and 116 Assists in 527 Apperances for us as a left back. He revolutionized the full back role\n\n**10) Marcelo:** He came to fill the role of roberto carlos and oh boy he did it perfectly. Over 100 Assists for us including so many legendary crosses like bale's goal in the ucl final. In the ucl 2017-18 campaign he also scored 3 goals in the knockout stages plus 2 assists in the final. 5x La Liga and 6x Champions League, he definitely deserves this spot for me\n\nSome Honourable Mentions: Paco Gento, Iker Casillas, Toni Kroos, Casemiro, Keylor Navas etc\n\nI would love to see some of our new players like bellingham, valverde, mbappe and vini to crack this list too by the end of their career but they would have to achieve a lot",

        "content": "Since there's talks about the club making moves to sell Rodrygo this summer, I felt it was apt to share their stats this year with the madridistas. It is to be noted that Rodrygo has a total of **1937 mins** in appearance for the club and Vini Jr has **2046 mins**. Both have the same number of games started, 22 games.\n\nI'll link the source here for [Vini Jr](https://footystats.org/players/brazil/vinicius-junior) and [Rodrygo](https://footystats.org/players/brazil/rodrygo).   \n  \nWould it make sense to give Rodrygo one more season under a new manager, even if a strong offer comes in this summer? Considering he'll be competing for the wide or forward roles with both Vini Jr. and Mbapp\u00e9, isn\u2019t there a risk that his potential could go to waste if he\u2019s not a guaranteed starter? Especially if the team continues with a narrow 4-4-2 formation? Let's be real the 4-3-3 system with all three forwards starting wasn't a success in any sense as we'd thought it'd be before the season started.",

Yes, he\u2019s incredibly talented and mature for his age, but Mbappe at 17 was already breaking through with Monaco, not a varca. He scored 28 goals and made 16 assists in just 46 games. That\u2019s nearly double Yamal\u2019s goals in less than half the matches. And this wasn\u2019t in a team built around youth development and possession,this was Ligue 1 football. So while Yamal is special, acting like he\u2019s the first of his kind ignores just how elite Mbappe already was back then.",
