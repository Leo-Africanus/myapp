        "content": "He has been way beyond terrible for almost all the 20 games he has played here, even more so against stronger sides... Now I don't buy this 'finished' argument cz last season he had 52 goals + 21 assists, the highest goal scorer that season and the highest goal scorer in champions league too with 5 goals in knockout stages. In euros he wasn't at his best but I can discount that due to his nose injury which surely affect his overall gameplay. Even against spain in the semifinal he got a brilliant cross for kolo muani to open the scoring for their team. Had france won the euros, I would be sure that mbappe was gonna win this year's ballon d'or.\n\nThe second argument is that he is mentally exhausted which seems more realistic... Like we have seen his capability to handle pressure on the biggest stages. In all the three penalties against Emi Martinez (the best penalty saver after yashin for me), I had no doubt that he was gonna score all three of 'em the moment he walked to the penalty box by just looking at his confidence. But here he can't even score penalties in league games. He seems so under-confident even in his run-up.\n\nAlso I don't buy this argument that he only performed in farmer's league cz I have seen what he does in world cup (14 g+a in 14 games) and champions league (76 g+a in 78 games).... and his record in knockout stage is even better (9 g+a in 8 wc knockout games) and (28 g+a in 28 ucl knockout games). He is also the highest wc knockout goal scorer and 6th highest ucl knockout goal scorer with only 4 pens in total in both of them. And the only time we faced him in champions league he almost f\\*cked us over with 2 great goals.\n\nSo he has surely performed in past and this has to be something of a mental block... What do you think about the reason of his terrible performance??\n\nEdit: Also I don't wanna defend this shitty performance from Mbappe. He is getting paid for his job and definitely has the top level psychologists and therapists out there to help him out... He needs to way better!!!",

        "content": "He has lost 50% of his pace in the past 12-18 months. I don\u2019t know how that\u2019s possible considering his age and that he\u2019s never had a serious injury, but he\u2019s so slow now. He can\u2019t beat any fullback for pace, he can\u2019t dribble past anyone, can\u2019t cross, his legs honestly seem like they\u2019re completely gone. That\u2019s why we always see him cut inside everytime he\u2019s on the left wing instead of knock it past the fullback and beat them for pace, I don\u2019t think he even has the confidence in his pace to beat defenders anymore. \n\nHe physically seems similar to Ronaldo after his knee injury in 2014, except he hasn\u2019t got the finishing, penalty box skills, or heading that Ronaldo possesses which lengthened his career for a long time. Mbapp\u00e9 relied heavily on his speed, and now it\u2019s all dried up, he\u2019s like a statue on the pitch. It\u2019s so sad to see a player that less than 2 years ago was absolutely destroying defenders with incredible pace, and now can\u2019t even outpace a single defender.\n\nIt begs the question of how has his physical abilities dropped so much at the young age of 25? He\u2019s always trained everyday, he\u2019s never had a serious injury, he\u2019s not incredibly overweight, so it makes zero sense that he seems so incredibly washed up at 25. The only other cases I can think that were similar was Michael Owen and R9, although they both had serious injuries which explain their drops in performances. I can\u2019t say the same for Mbapp\u00e9.\n\nAll the footage of him I\u2019ve seen with the ball boys, other players and staff has shown me he seems like a really good guy, which makes me really want him to do well. So it\u2019s devastating when you see a player with his reputation have their level drop so much, especially when he was expected to be the best player of the new generation. \n\nHonestly, maybe he needs to go to Saudi and earn a lot of money before clubs start to realise how much he has declined. Madrid could turn a massive profit from him, and he could earn hundreds of millions, it\u2019s sad, but it would probably be best for both parties.",

        "title": "Tchouameni is currently inept for our current midfield dynamics",
        "content": "He is so stale. So 1 dimensional. So stiff. So super slow. \n\nHe contributes nothing to our attack, which subsequently makes the link from midfield to attack completely disappear. It's not a coincidence that once he was subbed out against Athletic, we created, and eventually scored. Him being so slow and positionally stiff is what hinders our build-up. Add the fact that his passing has been horrid this season, and we're left with a rather glorified version of Ferland Mendy. Don't get me wrong, Bilbao played really well. They deserved the win. However, we played so bad before Tchouameni went out that we must speak about it. \n\nIn La Liga, before this match, we were on the up and up. There was more MOVEMENT, we were more COMPACT. and spaces were being exploited. With Tchouameni we sit too deep, and if at least he had pace to get us out quick it'd be justified to pick him, but he doesn't, so it's easy for teams to press us and eventually force a mistake. \n\nFede is understandably tired. However, Tchouameni's slowness forces Jude, Ceballos, and Fede to cover for him. Couple that with Mbappe being lazy and not covering ground that is left by the midfield so as to receive the ball and break in pace, and there's a huge gap created between midfield and attack. Let's not even get into how Tchou is already a liability, but adding Vazquez to the equation means that we have midfielders that have to cover for every other player. Therefore, greatly stunting our forward game.\n\nFede can easily play DM, and play it well enough that allows us to play actual football. It will go under the radar, but Tchou disrupted Raul Ascencio today. Yes, Raul could arguably be solely blamed for the first goal, but Tchou's lack of movement meant that, in general, throughout the game, Raul had to adapt to almost playing with a 3rd CB, and it wasn't pretty. Another alternative for the DM position so that Fede is rested is Modric and Ceballos paired together. They are not the fastest, so they can't do it individually and a pairing might more suitable. However, in spite of their slowness, they do have great passes on them. So, whilst they themselves can not break away fast, they can move the ball fast, and we can try breaking forward quickly with that. Otherwise, we just look in the academy and see what we find.\n\nMbappe is greatly costing Jude. That much we can all see. Between Arda, Endrick, Rodrygo, and Brahim our attack can be easily rotated, and SHOULD BE. When Perez said that at 21 Beckham had only played 51 games, but Jude is clocking in at over 200, it was pretty shocking to hear. I hope we don't act surprised when he becomes physically debilitated very soon if we don't care for him like we should (looking at you, Ancelotti). \n\nJust let Tchou play CB for the rest of the season. Rudiger needs rest, too!\n\n",

        "content": "A lot of fans have pointed out that the loss of Kroos is one of our biggest issues this season. After watching today's match against Bilbao, I completely disagree. He wouldn't last one month playing in this current setup. \n\nAncelotti, because he's terrified of Lucas Vasquez and Fran Garcia/Mendy defending, has effectively turned both Bellingham and Valverde into two wingbacks (btw, Valverde's dip in form needs to be talked about, looks like he's playing injured). This leaves a gaping hole in the midfield for the other midfielders to cover. Someone like Kroos would have had a heart attack tracking back. \n\nNow, what about Kroos contributing to the attack? Wouldn't really make a difference either. The reason why Kroos had such a revival of a season last year was actually because of the chemistry between Vini, Bellingham, Joselu, and Rodrygo. With Bellingham playing in that central attacking midfielder role, he had the license to kill and a lot of freedom to do his magic, while Vini was in the form of his life. When things weren't clicking, Joselu would come on and add a different flavor by being an aerial threat and pulling defenders away with his runs, allowing Bellingham to find the open space. Now, Joselu is no longer here so we have zero aerial threat apart from Bellingham. Meanwhile, Mbappe has turned into a Segunda player, so Bellingham is basically carrying the attack at the moment, while having to defend like a dog. He'll probably burn out before Christmas.\n\nTldr: Kroos would help improve the tempo that we play at, but his legs would fall off  very quickly under Ancelotti's current tactics. ",

        "content": "I decided to rewatch mbappe matches again including past matches where he played teams like madrid.  Something I noticed that I didn\u2019t see before.  I want to address what I think is the main problem of why he has been playing badly.\n\nHis dribbling and passing is off I concluded is because he is in a new team and is not feeling comfortable.  After d1 in college I didn\u2019t touch the ball for 2 years and one day decided to play a pick up game.  It was with people I didn\u2019t know and everyone was wearing the same color shirt.  When I got the ball I didn\u2019t know what to do or where to dribble, that along with the fact that I haven\u2019t touch the ball in years.  \n\nPeople including me said that he doesn\u2019t look like he care or is passionate even after making many mistakes.  Just rewatching a lot of past matches , I can tell you he does care but expressed it differently.  Every player is different.  Some players get frustrated at their mistakes and in that frustration makes even more mistakes.  I think mbappe is a player where if he makes a mistake, he moves on and try again and doesn\u2019t let it get to him.  \n\nThe passing and dribbling and scoring will come and we will see the real mbappe once he is comfortable and builds good chemistry with everyone on the team.  I noticed that he gets very nervous in 1v1 situations with the goal keeper.  He cares from just rewatching and keeping tab of his expressions.  \n\nUntil then we all need to be patience with Mbappe.  It\u2019s not him being out of form or depress.  That\u2019s what I thought and it pisses me off for a few months of the way he is playing.  So I decided to take a deeper look to really see what the problem is as he is not injured or anything. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/yjDygjR5DWM?si=WeavxU4tAGJ3kFJV",

We as fans needs to calm ourself down, its not end of the world, we're (potentially) one point away from top. Why do yall act we were never designated to struggle and jus keep on going without hurdles? \n\nYall so fkn emotional as if we're about to relegated, wasted a gazillion dollars on mbappe and he is the same since 5 years. Im not saying we should let go the criticism but ive read some comments to let mbappe go already and some of you sayin to stop supporting this club, are yall fkn insane? \n\nThe tactics have been comparatively bad but we aren't a club which is carried by individual performance,  we will be back eventually to our best and so will be Mbappe, if not, he won't be the first player to end up that way and isn't the only option available in football\n\nAnd some of yall need to be reminded that this club doesn't owe us anything, we will have to accept occasional failures and blunders.\n ",

Instead, he just makes runs behind defenders, playing like a striker, instead of holding the team together and controlling the game.\n\nHow can you watch Modri\u0107 drop deep, draw opponents, dribble past them, create chances, or set up plays, and then compare that to Jude?\n\nI honestly don\u2019t understand what Jude brings to the midfield for us. You won\u2019t understand either until his goals stop masking the fact that he costs us so much in midfield.",
