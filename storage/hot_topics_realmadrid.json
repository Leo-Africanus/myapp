        "content": "   I think at this point it has to be obvious that Mbappe is not a striker. So many people are so sure that Mbappe can play striker well and just has to learn. However, I think after so much, it is obvious he is not built for that. If you look at his way of playing, always shifts to the laterals of the pitch and plays deeper. If anything, he is more of a false 9, but without the playmaking qualities. I will keep saying it, we are wasting Mbappe by forcing him to play striker. Anyone who claims that he scores, yes he does, because he is Mbappe. Put him anywhere and he will deliver because he is world class, but that is not his best position for him or the team. The amount of times I see a beautiful play just for no one to be in the box is insane. For some reason Mbappe avoids the box as much as possible. I do not know how you would arrange the players after, but I would try Mbappe on the wing for at least one match. If you want to try stuff so much, then play your young prospects who are both strikers! Try playing Gonzalo on less important matches, play Mbappe on the wing for a couple matches, put Endrick, etc. I don\u2019t understand this fixedness on keeping Mbappe as a number nine. When we played the CWC we were doing pretty well because we had a proper 9. Unless we get one, we will keep doing bad. ",

        "content": "Someone recently posted a graphic on this sub, which showed 5 players in the 23/24 season had 10+ goals (Jude, Vini, Rodrygo, Joselu, and motherfucking Brahim Diaz). \n\nLet's look at how our current attack is faring in the league as we near the end of the first half of the season: \n\n\\- Mbappe: 13 goals (hip hip hooray for the Mbappe fanboys)\n\n\\- Vini: 5 goals (surprised to see him in 2nd place given his inconsistent form)\n\n\\- Guler: 3 goals\n\n\\- Jude: 2 goals (lol, how the fuck is Jude 4th on the list when he pretty much just came back from surgery). \n\nThree other players have 1 goal each, and literally everyone else has a big fat ZERO, including Valverde, Camavinga, and Rodrygo. This begs the question: how the fuck did we go from being a well-balanced attack with 5 players bagging 10+ goals to basically Mbappe FC? Losing Kroos was a big blow, but there's no way one player's departure can lead to such a drastic difference in the attack. \n\nIt also raises another question, why the fuck can't our midfield and defense help out the attack? I'm not expecting prime Ramos numbers, but fuck me, this is dismal. \n\n",

        "title": "Why do only our midfielders get blame? Our wing play has been a WALKING HALL OF SHAME and the worst that it has ever been in past 20 years.",
        "content": "Both the LW and the RW are black holes where every attack goes to die. Every inch of the decision making made from both the wings hurt our team. The RW doesn't exist and the LW plays in his own time zone disconnected with any other player on the outfield. Teenage fullbacks have their career best performances against our wingers. Teams have their pressure release valve when our wingers have the ball. \nThey don't make runs, They don't make one twos, They don't release the through balls, They ignore all the overlapping runs made by the fullbacks. They are still BABYied by our managers. They still want freedom. \n\nAnd then people pile on shit on our midfielders for not creating enough. Create for who? ",

        "content": "^(This is a last chance most probably for Rodrygo to prove his worth ....we all know he is a good player but Is he better than VINI ?)\n\n^(I cant remember a game where he started and have done well ,its always from the bench...Its been a long draught since his goal . I will he scored today)\n\nOne more important thing - If by chance rodrygo doesnt perform today and vini coming from the bench do better than him . Than i request mods to remove all hate posts related to vini .\n\nHe is one of the worlds best player and was last season as well.\n\nDont come at me with he was shit last season ...he had more goals then ballondor 2 Yamal and almost as much assists. Numbers dont lie. He is an outstanding player and so is rodrygo but if rodrygo doesnt perform today like the getafe match . No Vini hateposts allowed .\n\nSometimes i think our Sub is full of plastics the players other clubs would die for are given so much hate . I just cant stand own fans sometimes .\n\nLook at other clubs they defend there players even if they do not do well look at wirtz isak sesko salah pedro all forwards who have almost negligible output ,\n\nWhile our player who got 9 g/a in 15 match is given hate.\n\nDissapointed in this sub.",
