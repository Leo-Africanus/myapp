        "content": "#FT: OLYMPIACOS 0:2 JUVENIL A\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#UEFA YOUTH LEAGUE \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:**\n\n0:1 Carlos D\u00edez 78'\n\n0:2 Diego Mart\u00ednez 'Beto' (p) 90'+2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - kickoff, vamos! \n\n4' - Juvenil A are absolutely steamrolling Olympiacos in these first minutes, with two attacks cleared at the last minute, one shot by Liberto going wide and one huge error in the buildup after the following goal kick leading to nothing due to a misunderstanding\n\n5' - huge chance for Carlos D\u00edez, who takes a shot on the turn after a cross by Gabri Valero, but fires it straight at the keeper\n\n23' - Aguado puts Liberto though, but his shot from a tight angle is saved. The game is more open now, but with Juvenil A still clearly the better team\n\nHT - a first half in which our team dominated for the most part, but with Olympiacos having their phases too, with their most dangerous chance coming just before half time. The team needs to improve their focus in the final third to win this match\n\n46' - 2nd half underway \n\n57' - huge chance for Juvenil A - Aguado advances in the box and manages to square it to Carlos D\u00edez who arrives at the five yard box, but his shot from a very short distance is deflected by a defender at the last second\n\n\ud83d\udd04 59' - Jacobo comes on for Valero\n\n65' - spectacular save by the Olympiacos keeper after Beto volleys a shot towards the far corner after a clearance in their box \n\n\ud83d\udd04 67' - Lacosta comes on for Barroso\n\n72' - an Olympiacos attacker hits the post after Lezcano slips in the box after a long kick by their keeper\n\n76' - huge miss by Jacobo, who can't keep the ball down from a short distance after another good cross by Diego Aguado, who is undoubtedly the best player on the pitch\n\n\u26bd 78' - GOLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - Beto intercepts a pass nicely in their half, advances towards the box and plays it to D\u00edez, who pulls the trigger immediately and leaves the keeper without a chance with a low shot! \n\n\ud83d\udd04 79' - triple sub by Julian L\u00f3pez, who uses up all his subs - Gasc\u00f3n, Enzo, and Javi Mena on for goalscorer D\u00edez, Pol Dur\u00e1n and Ferr\u00e1n Seco\n\n87' - Aguado hits the bar with a powerful shot just inside the box! \n\n90'+1 - penalty for Juvenil A - Enzo's shot is saved from a short distance, but the rebound falls for Lacosta, and the defender tackles him while already lying on the ground\n\n\u26bd 90'+2 - GOLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A, Beto steps up and converts, leaving the keeper without a chance despite jumping in the right direction! \n\nFT - Juvenil A win a complicated match, in which they dominated the possession and had a huge amount of shots, but never fully suffocated Olympiacos, who had a couple of good chances themselves. Carlos D\u00edez finally broke the deadlock in the second half, and Beto closed the door for Olympiacos by converting a penalty in added time. The team continues their incredible run of form, with 15 wins out of 15 this season, 5 out of 5 in the Youth League, and is now first place in the UYL table, being the only team to not drop any points so far \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 16:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Olympiacos FC Training Centre, Piraeus\n\n**Referee:** Marc Nagtegaal (NED)\n\n**Competition:** UEFA Youth League, League Phase, Matchday 5\n\n**Viewing options:** [RMTV/RM PLAY](https://play.realmadrid.com/home)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Juvenil A XI (4-4-3):** \u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez - Diego Aguado, Mario Rivas, Ferr\u00e1n Seco (79' Javi Mena), \u00c1lvaro Lezcano - Diego Mart\u00ednez \u2018Beto\u2019, Carlos D\u00edez (79' Ignacio Gasc\u00f3n), Pol Dur\u00e1n (79' Enzo Alves) - Liberto Navascu\u00e9s, Jaime Barroso (67' Diego Lacosta), Gabri Valero (67' Jacobo Ortega)\n\nBench: Guille Ponce (GK), Ariel Nkoghe, Bruno Galassi, Alfonso Romero.\n\nCoach: Juli\u00e1n L\u00f3pez de Lerma\n\nUYL League Phase Stats: 4th | 12pts | 4-0-0 | 12:3\n",

It is easiest to see when LaLiga clubs face non LaLiga teams. For example, Barcelona players against Chelsea were in \u201cslow-mode\u201d. Similar problem is with us. How did we develop that? I don\u2019t see that enemy teams are pressing a lot, to make us run non-stop, but we rather play super slow and wait for Mbappe to score. \n\nI was hyped to see Atletic Bilbao and Villareal to play in Champions League, but now I am disappointed. \n\nRemember few years ago, Spanish football was dominant, and playing in such league made Real Madrid strong. What we see today is slow and boring football. ",

        "content": "First of all, I think Xabi is doing an acceptable job overall given his constraints and the nature of the squad that he has. However, improvements can be made. \nTo me, the team needs to play at a faster pace. We spend a considerable amount of time in the buildup phase of an attack and that gives the opposition too much time to set themselves defensively. That makes defences harder to unlock generally and near impossible against disciplined teams. \nAdditionally, by spending so much time trying to break a defence makes the players vulnerable on the transition since the defence tends to lose concentration defensively after attacking for so long. \nIn football, possession is a statistic that means nothing. When you have the ball, do something with it quickly. The scoreline is the only metric worth tracking. ",

And the funny thing is that the excuses fans now make for Rodrygo were never once brought up for Gareth Bale: \u201cOh, he\u2019s not playing in his preferred position\u2026 Oh, he\u2019s overshadowed because of Ronaldo and Benzema\u2026 Oh, he doesn\u2019t get special treatment like the other stars of the team.\u201d\n\nRodrygo will live long on the memory of what he did against Man City and Chelsea.

        "content": "Growing up I've always felt RM had one of the most secure dressing room maybe along with Bayern. Very little controversies or media stories. Even during the Barca treble years there was absolutely reports of unrest. RM have always been one of the most media secure football clubs as far as I've known. But what's changed now?\n\nWe're literally top of the table. Have 2 defeats in the season till now with 2 draws. How is there so much unrest? How is Alonso's job at risk? We've got the best defence in the league &amp; 3rd best in UCL. Coming to Alonso. Is he making mistakes? Yes. Are some of his decisons highly questionable? 100%. But that's what you get with a manager with 2+1/2 seasons of senior management. HE WILL MAKE MISTAKES! THAT IS WHAT YOU GET WITH A YOUNG MANAGER.\n\nArteta took time. Kompany literally got relegated. You have to give him the headroom to learn from his mistakes instead of sack threats. Are we not allowed a transition? Are we not alloed a rebuild phase? Plus its a well known fact that we had an incomplete transfer window!\n\nComing to the dressing room. I feel so sad. Bunch of primadonnas. How have you had your head so up your arse as to not renew your contract cause the manager is rotating you? Its his job ffs! His job is create tactics &amp; win &amp; your job is to play the way he wants! These massive egos will ruin the club. I really believed these issues would never appear at RM.\n\nFreaking Cristiano was let go due to these issues. Who do these players think they are?           \n\nI miss Sergio Ramos in times like this. \n\nPS - I'm not defending Alonso but he's exactly what you're gonna get with a young manager. You have to accep his vision. ",

        "content": "I genuinely think Xabi has the potential to become one of the best managers in the world. But even if he doesn\u2019t reach that level, the club still needs to back him right now. There isn\u2019t a single top manager in Europe who would cave to this group of players. If they get their way again, what manager can realistically succeed here?\n\nDo people seriously think Arteta, Lucho, Conte or anyone of that calibre would be a good fit for these players? Vini needs to be moved on, Xabi needs a striker who fits his style, and the club needs to send a clear message: the collective comes first. This team has rarely been greater than the sum of its parts, and that\u2019s the real shame",

        "content": "Real Madrid will never be a club defined by average players or a modest star system like Bayer Leverkusen because its identity is built on global media power and the constant pursuit of the biggest names in football. The club thrives on being a spectacle, a brand that demands the brightest stars to maintain its dominance in sales, sponsorships, and media rights. Xabi Alonso understood this culture when he joined, adapting to the reality that Madrid is not just a team, but a global institution. To suggest that Real Madrid would willingly sell off all its star players is absurd, because the club\u2019s financial model and prestige depend on showcasing elite talent. The Gal\u00e1ctico tradition ensures that Madrid will always attract and retain world-class players, reinforcing its status as the ultimate footballing stage.",

        "content": "Vinicius Jr signed fresh terms at Madrid in 2022, the details of which were announced a year later. He currently earns around \u20ac18million (\u00a315.8m; $20.7m) a year after tax and his contract contains a \u20ac1billion release clause.\n\nIn 2024, a delegation working on behalf of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF) was keen to explore a move for him to join a Saudi Pro League club. It would have involved lucrative personal terms, but did not develop into anything concrete.\n\nEarlier this year, Madrid made Vinicius Jr a renewal offer, including an increase in salary to around \u20ac20million net a year. When this was not accepted, the club asked the player\u2019s side to propose a figure.\n\nVinicius Jr\u2019s representatives requested a historic contract, in the region of the highest ever at the club (which was given to Cristiano Ronaldo), with a package of up to \u20ac30million per season. This included base salary, performance bonuses and a renewal bonus, something which has not been offered to players at Real Madrid previously.",
