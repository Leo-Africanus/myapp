        "content": "I must say, he's surprised me. His quality on the ball, his progressive passing, the way he maneuvers in the midfield. I've certainly had a lot to say about him in the past, but I'm very pleased with what I've been seeing from him as of late.It\u2019s not just the technical ability, he\u2019s showing a lot more confidence and composure when he's on the pitch. He\u2019s starting to pick the right moments to push forward and contribute to the attack while still being reliable defensively. That balance has made him a much more effective player, and it feels like he\u2019s finally carving out his place in the squad.Of course, there\u2019s always room for improvement. He still needs to work on maintaining this level consistently and avoiding some of the errors that have held him back in the past. But when he\u2019s in this kind of form, he brings a spark to the midfield that\u2019s hard to ignore. It\u2019s a side of him I\u2019ve wanted to see more of for so long. I hope he keeps this momentum going. The potential has always been there, and if he can continue to deliver performances like these, I think he\u2019ll play a key role for us as the season progresses. ",

        "content": "I've done how many video analysis on this on YouTube already but how many time has Vazquez failed to deal with a cross at the back post now it's actually becoming a fucking joke how the same thing happens over and over.\n\nFirst there was no press on the ball, one player was able to carry the balls past about 4 or 5 players without so much as a tackle and to top it they get a cross in without being challenged and last of all Vazquez again absolutely loses sight of the player closest to him that he should be marking at the back post. \n\nBut people will call you negative for calling out shit that the whole coaching team and manager should have realised by now.\n\nWhat are these fucking Jokers getting paid for. If you literally watch any of my videos on goals breakdown. You will notice how many times that same scenario with Vazquez has happened.",
