Honestly, if I didn't have this passion, the world of football would have disgusted me a long time ago. I would never advise my child to step foot in the football world.\"",
        "content": "On the rape allegations last year\n\n\"I wasn't even concerned. It was just sad to see everyone jumping on it like it was a steak, on such a serious subject. It happens to far too many women, unfortunately, for us to jump on it for headlines and articles. No one took the time to ask what happened to the potential victim. And when everyone saw that I wasn't in this story, what happened? She's in the gutter, no one knows where she is, we don't care. It's a sensitive subject and it made me sad. I knew I was going to get back up because I wasn't involved, the police never called me, my name was never mentioned.\"\n\n\"I knew from the start that it would be okay, but it's complicated. Especially for those close to you, even more so for women. Whether you like it or not, you feel that in the other person's eyes, the person is thinking: 'What if there was a 1% chance that he did something?' It hurt me. I have nothing to do with it... These are human reactions from the women around me, because there are too many who go through this. I just had to accept it, keep quiet, go to training. Sometimes you see comments... But you accept it. Carlo (Ancelotti) told me it was unfair. I said to him: 'What should I do other than let it go and score goals?'\"\n\nOn the legal dispute with PSG\n\n\"It's my responsibility by right, it's labor law. The procedure gave the impression that I wanted to harm PSG. I signed an employment contract. I just wanted to be paid. I have nothing against PSG, I love this club, I have friends there. But it's the only way to get what I'm owed, something I've earned with my sweat. Whether you like it or not, it's still a job. But I already knew I wasn't getting paid when I was at PSG. When the money doesn't come in, you see it. I could have caused a scandal while I was there, but I told myself it wasn't worth it. But when you see that you're not being paid, after a while, you have to react. Only you quickly come across as the ex who's angry... If it could have been settled in an office, this story would never have existed.\"\n\nOn Cristiano Ronaldo's quote that he could only trust four people with his eyes closed\n\n\"I understand. 'Why is he telling me that? What does he want from me? What does he expect from me?' There are a lot of 'whys'. The line between being careful and being paranoid is very thin. You can come across as crazy. How many times have I heard people talk about a player and say: 'He's crazy!' No, he's paranoid because there are only crazy people around him. Maybe he met a beautiful person there, but he's just had 20 meetings with crazy people, so he has doubts, and that's normal.\"\n\nOn the mental exhaustion for players\n\n\"The complexity of the thing is that people have trouble with it. You must not show it. Someone in his living room would say, 'Fuck, at the price they're paying you, I'd be happy every day!' That's why sometimes it's better to keep it to yourself. If I win the World Cup, you come to me three days later and ask me about it, I can say it. You're practically untouchable there. You lose a match, you say that, they tell you that you're saying that because you were terrible. It doesn't change anything if I was already like that before the match... It's all a question of timing.\"",

Arbeloa managed to set up the buildup and the press in a way that gave Castilla control and took Wolves' attackers out of the game - the team created and missed opportunities in open play, but in the end Bruno Iglesias' free kick golazo still gave them the deserved win\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 20:00 CEST\n\n**Venue:** Molineux Stadium, Wolverhampton\n\n**Referee**: Jacob Viera\n\n**Competition:** U21 Premier League International Cup, Group Stage\n\n**Viewing options:** [RM Play](https://play.realmadrid.com/live/237284), [RMTV](https://www.realmadrid.com/es-ES/real-madrid-tv)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-3-3): Sergio Mestre - V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as (67' Joan Mart\u00ednez), Manu Serrano, Diego Aguado, David Jim\u00e9nez - Cristian David (61' Jorge Cestero), Roberto Mart\u00edn (67' Gabri Castrelo), Manuel \u00c1ngel (61' Pol Dur\u00e1n) - Bruno Iglesias, Jacobo Ortega (62' Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga), Pol Fortuny\n\nBench: Guille S\u00fanico (GK), Lamini Fati.\n\nUnavailable: Fran Gonz\u00e1lez (Spain U21 call-up), Mario Rivas (injury), Jes\u00fas Fortea (Spain U19 call-up), C\u00e9sar Palacios (injury), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (Spain U19 call-up), Rachad Fettal (injury). \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** W\n\n**PL International Cup stats:** - | 0pt | 0-0-0 | 0:0\n\n",

(I'd go alone.) If tickets are available, what would the approximate price be?\n\n  \nAny advice you could give me would be more than grateful.",
