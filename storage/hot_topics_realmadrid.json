However, it seems like Guler is meant to play as a deep playmaker by the coach when Bellingham arrives. That's why I feel like Valverde will start playing as a RW in lots of games.

I am just sick of CBS clowns and others in French club and media. It doesn\u2019t matter if it should be a plenty or not. What matters is that it happened against us. It\u2019s a 50/50 call if we want to discuss it but that only works with rational people!",

Headlines everywhere: \"Vini puts his team at risk again!\" And you just know Carvajal will still be quoted after the game saying some wild nonsense.\n\nEven when Dean Huijsen got tackled today, imagine if it had been Vini even breathing near the ref \u2014 automatic yellow. The guy just points at the grass and it\u2019s a booking.\n\nAnd then you\u2019ve got people who have never dealt with racism telling him to \u201cjust score goals,\u201d as if he\u2019s not racially abused week in, week out and still expected to be a robot.\n\nThe standard is NOT the same, and it\u2019s exhausting to watch.\n\nTL;DR: If that red card was Vini, the headlines would be completely different.",

        "content": "  I find amazing how Tchoumeni has been consistently good for a while now. He was criticized during the shenanigans last year, but he has shown to be extremely consistent. Not only does Xabi value him and think he is important, but Ancelotti also thought the same. He has been a constant in the game for so long, being basically a guaranteed starter so far. He is good at tackling, cutting plays, and just being physical in the game. I feel like he is not talked about enough and even underrated by other fan based. He is not the best in his position, but he is still a good player. I think he is underrated because of his lack of passing skills and game creation. Physical players are not usually the most appreciated, but if he becomes a decent passer then he would probably be one of the best. ",
