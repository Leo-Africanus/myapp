        "content": "Liverpool is by far the best team itw at the moment. They are at top of premiere league  by a pretty decent margin, unbeaten in champions league and doing really well in their domestic competitions too.\n\nHistorically we have always owned liverpool in ucl knockout matches, but this time they kinda seem invicible. We are improving no doubt, especially our attack with mbappe coming back in form and rodrygo putting up incredible numbers since coming back from his injury but our defense is still shit. Like even vs sevilla when there was literally no pressure on us, we missed so many chances and conceded 2 goals which should have not been let in at any cost and was completely the defense's fault. This has been however over-shadowed bcz our rivals mainly barca are playing like shit so we are still in contention of la liga.\n\nYes we have clutched up in champions league before, but I am not sure how long we can depend on these last minute goals... I feel we need to play asencio and let him develop. I have no idea why Carlo is benching him. We need to bench vazquez and buy another right back. And please give some time to Arda and Endrick. Like even versus sevilla when we were winning easily still carlo made mbappe, rodrygo and fede play almost the entire game instead of substituting them. This is quite risky given how many injuries we are going through this season.\n\nWhat's your opinion on this??",
