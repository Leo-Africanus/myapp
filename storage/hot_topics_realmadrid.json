Dean is solid aerially as well (12/17)\n* Dean leads in ball carries, Vini at #2, Carreras is at #3\n* [Arda and Kylian have created the most chances this season so far](https://www.statmuse.com/fc/ask/most-chances-created-this-season?l=eu5)\n\n[Guler x Mbappe is the new Ozil x CR7 ?](https://preview.redd.it/z3jyaxkgn4qf1.png?width=987&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64bf9cd2d981b4117186f2287b860e2163e4e8b4)\n\n[Attacking Sequence Involvements in top 5 leagues so far](https://nitter.net/OptaAnalyst/status/1969018479056470196#m) :\n\n[Promising stats so far](https://preview.redd.it/n5bxv3smn4qf1.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=059d0b14caac588a4bad13d01eb7aeec0245af64)\n\n* 3/10 players are Madridistas\n* Carreras is a gift\n* How did we miss out on Olise?\n* Fede's new role is usually up for discussion &amp; criticism these days, the stats seem to suggest otherwise, many fans say he has lost his spark\n\nNOTE :\n\n* I know Barca has faced ***considerably*** weaker opposition so far, and the Violencia game is an outlier that kinda skews the data in their favour a lot\n* We played \\~60 mins as 10men vs LaReal\n* Although this is too early into the season to judge teams solely based on stats(I believe stats give out a more balanced picture only after around 10 matches), the eye test is still kinda valid and the stats fit with what we see on the field.\n* [Take the numbers, such as duels won or carries or dribbled past, etc. with a grain of salt, these numbers are often miscalculated and often misrepresent the quality](https://x.com/Hennes_4/status/1728541660194156883)\n\n[Stats can be decieving](https://preview.redd.it/t24vz105o4qf1.png?width=756&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40d4f5d7da2280fbb2a466a6148d96e0a59f9e00)\n\n  \nI initially posted in the Weekly Open Thread, but someone said this should be a post, so here it is.",

Someone who maybe is a warrior but also someone with calm nerves, and direction. \n\nAnd every year we\u2019ve lost someone who was like that. From Ronaldo to Modric. But right now it seems no one is in the wings to fulfill that role. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t think one can just \u201cacquire\u201d one. \n\nI mention this because I think the red cards, the second half struggled and things like that are sort of by products of this issue. \n\n",
