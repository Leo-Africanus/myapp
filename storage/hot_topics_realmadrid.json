Every game this season feels like it could be lost, not because of the difficulty of the teams we\u2019re facing, but because of how trash we are. We never keep a positive streak for more than two games, our players regularly drop form from match to match, and the coach seems to not have any solution for any of this. The whole club\u2019s in shambles; we lost Nacho, Joselu and Toni Kroos last season, yet we didn\u2019t make any signings to fill in their roles. Mbapp\u00e9 and Endrick are great new additions, but we needed a CB, especially necessary during the Winter Transfer Window, we needed a player to fill in for the massive gap that Kroos left in our midfield, but with all that said, we only signed forwards. It\u2019s ridiculous, I don\u2019t get how this kinda terrible decision making is possible. It\u2019s really a shame to have such quality in one team, but not be able to win any game comfortably.",

        "content": "The game last night wasn\u2019t really a surprise. We\u2019ve seen the same scenario play out, with competitive teams this season. The reason for it is we don\u2019t have a midfield maestro, except the 2 games where Ceballos played good, then he got injured. You can see it in the transitions from the midfield to the offense. That\u2019s what makes the offense what it is. We\u2019ve seen our wingers drop because of it. This season they have been forced to be creative, and you can only do so much. We need Bellingham to move out of CAM, and assume this role. He\u2019s the only visionary in our midfield unfortunately, except Modric for 15 minutes of the games, due to his age. Valverde is a box to box, so I\u2019m not sure why we are reliant on him to do that type of work. Offenses need key midfielders that make key passes, if we don\u2019t have that we don\u2019t have a team. That role isn\u2019t just to find solutions in the offensive end. It also creates value in terms of moving pressure from the opposition on our defense. Brahim can play a hybrid CM because he can create spaces and dribble. (we did it with DiMaria in 2014), but we need the coaching staff to see this. Our offense outside of Mbappe looks like Man utd\u2019s and it\u2019s scary. ",

When you know the coach will not bench you, you will drop stinkers and play lazy ass football just like our players been doing. Look at Asencio he plays like he has a point to prove, whereas Mbappe and Vini play like they doing us a big damn favor. All of this while we have players on the bench who could have made a difference, players such as Arda, Brahim, and Endrick. At a club like Real Madrid, it is your performance that should get you ahead of others, not how familyish you can get with the team and the coach. ",

        "content": "Football is not only about gameplay but also about confidence and momentum. We lost all the momentum after the first goal yesterday. What I feel is our team will play attacking with bernabau behind the team and if we can get one goal in early 15 mins the game will be fun to watch. It is hard to overcome but early goal can disrupt the opponent as well. Like how Man city and Chelsea changed from world class team to mediocre teams due to 1-2  goals with in short span. ",

        "content": "We all watched the same game yesterday, we all felt the same frustration again and again and again.\n\nYes we have actually done it before, and with fashion actually, but the team we watched yesterday, and against Barcelona and against Valencia isn\u2019t capable of doing this unless a major shift happens.\n\nIt\u2019s been weeks now with Vini, he tries to dribble, gets blocked, he tries to run, loses the ball, he tries to send a crucial pass, intercepted. Him losing last year\u2019s Ballon d\u2019or and realising that this year it\u2019s also lost since Mbappe has become the star, has gotten to him. And to be honest, who wouldn\u2019t feel the same were we in his shoes? \n\nI\u2019m all for Ancelotti out but not now. At the end of the season we let him go and hopefully get Xabi Alonso. Yesterday\u2019s tactic was horrible to say the least, we played shit throughout the game and then when it became 2-0 we started the subs? Alaba was beaten left and right, why not sub him after the first goal? Why not at the start of the second half? We played a very bad first half and we all hoped \u201cWell no way we would play that bad in the second half!\u201d. But we felt it, Ancelotti must\u2019ve felt it. Why keep him for so late and your team is getting pounded with missed chances?\n\nWhy not sub Brahim early on? The team clearly had a bad attacking first half, Bellingham was trying to make runs from the inside but it was impossible to get the ball to him. Why not sub in a player with technical skills and has played the EPL early on? Why keep Vini for so long on the pitch? \n\nYes Mbappe tried to create some chances but rarely did we get to the goal. \n\nWhat about defence? We are so lucky to have Ascensio and Courtois (A great successor for the Saint) protecting us from near goal situations. And yes, the game could\u2019ve held more goals for Arsenal had it not been for those 2. No comment on Valverde, the guy has been giving blood every game of the season. Rudiger was good also. Maybe defence was ironically the best piece from yesterday. Yes, the freekicks were beautiful yesterday but just as Courtois said, given unnecessarily.\n\nThe same people whom we need to carry us (not just play well) next week are the same ones who let us down yesterday and have been letting us down for the past few games for whatever reason are expected to do a 180 in the second leg and bring out the best performance of the past 2-3 years, a feat, which -although has happened before- seems a bit too hopeful. Maybe we won\u2019t need a complete team performance, maybe Rodrigo plays a superb game and carries us, but we have to end the game with at least a 3 goals difference. Meaning we HAVE to try our best not to concede a goal. And watching yesterday\u2019s game, while ignoring the 2 freekicks, I can\u2019t see it too impossible for Arsenal to score, especially since we will be on our toes the whole 90 mins and with some spaces in the back. Add to the mix Ancelotti trying the same tactics or maybe coming up with a crazy stupid plan for the second leg, would make me not so hopeful for the next game. \n\nI have been a fan for the past 18 years, I have witnessed the greatest comebacks in football being achieved by our guys, and I hope like all of us to watch a game that would remind the world who is Real Madrid in the UCL in case someone forgot, but this time I am not seeing it.",
