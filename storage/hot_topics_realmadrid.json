        "content": "#FT: JUVENIL A 5:2 OM\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#UEFA YOUTH LEAGUE \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:**\n\n1:0 Thiago Pitarch 17'\n\n1:1 Mohamed Baradji 25'\n\n2:1 Anis Doubal (own goal) 27'\n\n2:2 Tadjidine Mmadi (penalty) 42'\n\n3:2 Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (penalty) 53'\n\n4:2 Diego Mart\u00ednez 'Beto' 80'\n\n5:2 Adri P\u00e9rez 90'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - kickoff, vamos! \n\n\u26bd 17' - GOLLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - Arnu steals the ball from their defensive midfielder, and quickly plays it to Thiago at the edge of the box. He takes a few quick touches to create space, and then cuts his shot across, low into the far corner\n\n\u26bd 25' - goal for OM - Illia punches away a free kick poorly, then their player takes a shot and it hits the post - the ball bounces to Baradji, who takes a little touch, and Joan Mart\u00ednez can't clear it off the line in time (and even then it would've bounced back into the net again), what a crazy and unfortunate goal\n\n\u26bd 27' - GOLLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - and right in the next attack, Fortea advances on the right wing - his powerful and low cross gets deflected into the near corner by Marseille's Doubal! \n\n42' - penalty for OM after a foul by Rivas \n\n\u26bd 42' - Mmadi converts\n\nHT - half time in a very open match where most dangerous situations ended up being goals on both ends - the goals we conceded were entirely avoidable, and the team needs to pay special attention to defending set-pieces better or preventing them from happening in the first place\n\n46' - 2nd half underway \n\n51' - penalty for Juvenil A after Y\u00e1\u00f1ez gets tripped in the box! \n\n\u26bd 53' - GOLLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - Y\u00e1\u00f1ez takes it himself and converts! \n\n\ud83d\udd04 59' - Rivas and Cestero off for Valde and Beto \n\n\ud83d\udd04 71' - Y\u00e1\u00f1ez off for Gabri Valero\n\n\u26bd 80' - GOLLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - golazo de Beto! free kick from around 20 metres out, and Diego Mart\u00ednez strikes it right into the top corner on the goalkeeper's side of the goal! \n\n\ud83d\udd04 83' - last subs, Ciria and Arnu off for Adri P\u00e9rez and Jacobo\n\n\u26bd 90' - GOLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - and the cherry on top, after a dribble by Gabri Valero, he crosses the ball low into the box - it gets deflected towards the far post by the defender, where Adri appears to head it into the net\n\nFT - a calm and controlled second half by the team makes the match end with a comfortable scoreline - they had OM under control defensively much more than in the first half and pounced in the decisive moments in attack. We will get to know the opponents in the Round of 16 and the possible path through the rest of the tournament on Friday\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 16:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee:** Sam Barrott (ENG) \n\n**Competition:** UEFA Youth League, Round of 32\n\n**Viewing options:** [RMTV/RM PLAY](https://play.realmadrid.com/home)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Juvenil A XI (4-3-3):** Illia Voloshyn - Diego Aguado, Mario Rivas (59' Victor Valdepe\u00f1as 'Valde'), Joan Mart\u00ednez, Jes\u00fas Fortea - Jorge Cestero (Diego Mart\u00ednez 'Beto'), Carlos D\u00edez, Thiago Pitarch - Alexis Ciria (83' Adri P\u00e9rez), Adri\u00e1n Arnuncio \u2018Arnu\u2019 (83'' Jacobo Ortega), Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (71' Gabri Valero)\n\nBench: \u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez (GK), Melvin Ukpeigbe, \u00c1lvaro Lezcano, Pol Dur\u00e1n. \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro L\u00f3pez\n",

When people talk about Real Madrid\u2019s worst signings, they mention Hazard, Jovic, Illarramendi, Woodgate, Danilo, Kaka, James, etc \u2014 but never Reinier. Not out of ignorance, but because the player is forgotten to that extent.\n\n\u20ac30 million for a player who never played a single minute for the first team is embarrassing and almost comical. Easily a top-five worst signing in the club\u2019s history.\n\nAnyways.. he\u2019s still only 24. I hope he manages to find himself again. Maybe he\u2019ll get another chance to play in Europe.",

        "title": "How Simone Inzaghi would be an underrated alternative for Real Madrid",
        "content": "I think Simone Inzaghi should be a serious contender for a future Real Madrid manager, if Arbeloa leaves this summer. And if not then, further ahead in the future.\n\nUnlike Tuchel, Emery, and Klopp, who are the most common names circulating, his system does not revolve around a high press, which we realistically will never get with our current squad.\n\nInstead of high pressing, he focuses on defensive shape and structure, similar to how Ancelotti would ask our CB\u2019s and Mendy to stay back while allowing our front three more freedom. His system is filled with quick vertical football and counters, which would suit our pace and speed offensively. Most Real Madrid fans probably thought of him as a manager while watching the Inter Milan vs Barcelona matchup in the Champions League. Last but not least, his system does not revolve around possession, which helps hide the fact that we clearly lack a tempo setter and have more of a physical than technical midfield.\n\nHe is extremely pragmatic in the way he sets his teams up and truly a big game manager. Having taken an aging Inter Milan side to two Champions League finals in four years, drawn against us with Al Hilal, and even beaten Manchester City with them. His personality is calm and collected and likely would not cause the same friction as managers like Conte or Tuchel.\n\nLooking at the managerial market for next summer, he is probably the top level coach least dependent on high pressing football and heavy possession, aside from Ancelotti after the Brazil job. For those reasons, I think these factors make him a realistic fit for Real Madrid.\n\nThoughts?\n\nEDIT:\n\nIt seems many people claim that he has underachieved in the league, and while I understand that argument, Serie A is far less predictable than La Liga. Even Carlo Ancelotti, who had an amazing European career with AC Milan, did not dominate Serie A in the same way.\n\nAs for comparisons with managers such as Tuchel and Klopp, the intention of this post was to highlight tactical compatibility with our current squad. I believe Inzaghi could start winning with only minor additions, whereas the others would likely require a full rebuild for heavy pressing system like gegenpressing. I personally cannot see Klopp returning to management anytime soon, and I do not believe Tuchel would be willing to work here given his previous tensions with mbappe at PSG and potentially with Bellingham in England (depending on how the World Cup goes and whether he starts regularly).",

It\u2019s a variety of different reasons and some of the cultural issues at board level weigh heavy. \n\nI can\u2019t help but think about the \u201cdelayed bill\u201d from a squad building model that looked ideal even just a few years ago. \n\nThe Youth Transfer Policy was a resounding success but has now become part of the current decline.\n\nThe youth policy or \u201cBaby Galacticos\u201d optimized for talent + resale. The board went with the \u201ccream rises to the top\u201d philosophy but never cut out duplicative roles and skill sets. Forcing managers to put round pegs in square holes.\n\nJoselu is one example. A journeyman who played at seven different clubs in Spain, England, and Germany before finally returning to his dream club. That journey gave him perspective. He knew his role and knew what he could provide to the team. He didn\u2019t take the RM chance for granted. \n\nLuka Modric, another example. Would he be signed today given the new policy? 27-years-old from a Premier League club for big money yet not a commercial super star? The policy would have rejected the most decorated player in RM history.\n\nElite talent isn\u2019t enough. You still need veterans with perspective, role players who accept limits and know their limits. Many within the squad aren\u2019t as good as we thought they were. The reality is some hard decisions need to be made this summer. They may not be good decisions from a commercial perspective, but the right decisions from a sporting perspective. This is salvageable. The model can still work but it needs to be less stringent and open to different profiles: technical profiles, age curves, role expectations, etc.\u201d\n\nThought this was a really good piece that sums up our problem perfectly and would give the full article a read if you have the time.",

        "content": "He is the one player I had hoped would make the jump by now. He's had so many opportunities but he just can't seem to focus. He has all the tools to be a great defensive midfielder: he has an insane motor, he can tackle, he can shoot from far, he can pass, he can dribble... I don't know why he hasn't become the player we all envisioned. Is it because he likes partying? Is it because he's injury prone? I really hope that for our sake he turns it around. I do think that he has a very high ceiling as a player, but the floor is pretty abysmal.  At this point I'm open to the team selling him, but he's the one player I'm most scared of losing because he has shown flashes of greatness and it would suck for him to become a world class player for another team after all the opportunities he had here.

        "content": "Courtois was at his prime at Chelsea, but after the birth of his second child he decided to put in the transfer request and join his ex-teams rivals on a lower salary to be in Madrid. Morata also was at Chelsea and once his twin sons were born he went on loan to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Family has a big influence on these players. \n\nNow, Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz has one year left on his contract which ends in 2027. And he just got married last year in Sevilla. Now is the time he starts thinking about where he wants to start his family. He's been away from Spain for 8 years after being at Napoli and PSG. He's also at that 29 years old age that allows a nice 5 year contract at Madrid. And with Madrid needing that big midfield player, someone who controls the tempo like Kroos. I believe that he has a great chance in joining us. \n\nQuality player that doesn't have to be the star of the show, but will get the ball moving and in dangerous areas. He was a big part in getting Spain playing more vertical and not as possession safe, one of the reasons why Luis de la Fuente made Spain much more dangerous and successful recently. And Fabi\u00e1n was one of the players Luis Enrique left out last world cup when they crashed out against Morocco. \n\nRenew with a coach who never saw his ability in Spain favoring that Barca midfield for the world cup or go to a team that favored Luis de la Fuentes vertical football with one of his trusted u21 teammates Ceballos and a top teammate Mbappe who kept being the best with the disastrous Neymar and Messi seasons. \n\nJust a theory, but I hope we get that left footed midfield maestro. He's a healthy player and has that Spanish Isco disco Ceballos Magic with some long legs. ",
