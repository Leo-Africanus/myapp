One time there was even a beach ball thrown on the pitch when our player was going to take a corner. There were even some spectators who spat on Courtois as well as Mbappe. Even Llorente was about to kick the ball after failing at taking a penalty. It was good that Mbappe intervened but why was only Mbappe shown Yellow and why not Llorente since he was about to disrupt the game itself. After the match, the ugly tone and intimidation of Simeone at the post-match press conference asking Journalists to raise their hands if anyone thought if there's a double touch from Alvarez?? This is utter hooliganism from Atletico Staff &amp; Management, Atletico played at our stadium as well in first leg but we get to witness a good game without any fuss/nuisance. This aggressive behaviour from Atletico staff/management/spectators should be shunned immediately else its going to take a far more dark turn very soon.\n\nUEFA should've also sanctioned Atletico players, staff as well as spectators who indulged in all these ugly affairs the other day? What was that ambiguous statement from UEFA regarding penalty call, saying they'll discuss with FIFA/IFAB about removing the rules where touch was unintentional. How are they sure about that?",

Gtfo with this he didn't play well and missed a penalty card. By that logic if you get lucky in your miserable life you're not allowed to celebrate because oh \"you didn't do well today \". I know who made my day every year for the last 3 years. Those screamers against sevilla man city that goal in the semis in the finals. Here's a man broken and hungry. I'll not turn on vini. Even if we went out last night, because this club is best represented not when we win but when we lose. I love all the players for having the balls to do shithousery at the same stadium which supported racist chants, threatened vini to never dance and gets teased by for not winning the \"balon'dor\". Our fanbase is used to success which I do not complain it is a thing of honour, but these fans are pampered. Let me tell you something very clear. Before we started winning these cl's from 2014-2024... We had won 3 in some last 50 years. Let that sink in for a moment. This guy gave us 2 of the greatest nights. I love you exactly for who you are vini. Never change but always get better \u2665\ufe0f",

Well guess his master plan for this season was to make sure we have double agents (ex-madrid players) planted across Europe to sabotage their current teams.\n\nLast season, Kovacic steps up to take a pen and shoots it at Lunin's. Okay fine, Anyone can, miss. Man  then proceeds to come in as a sub and gifts us a goal at the Etihad to make it 3-2. This week, you got Llorente, who could've kept the tie alive but blasts it on the crossbar to send us through. Now ... I'm looking at you Martin Odegaard ... what do you have in store for us ?\n\nAnd if we get past Arsenal, rest assured, we already have sleeper agent ready to be activated. We'll either have Hakimi (PSG) or Marco Asencio (Aston Villa) prepped to drop the most dogshit performances to help their old club, yet again.\n\nAll roads lead to Munich. Perez been playing 5D chess the whole time, and none of us saw it coming. But it all making sense now.",

I've been a madridista for quite a while and I am so excited to be able to go to this game! \n\nI will be traveling with my family but they won't go to the game because of the start time (two young kids), so I am wondering if anyone is planning on going, maybe we can hang out a bit before/after the game. I got the VIP Silver ticket for this sector: GRADA ALTA LAT. ESTE - 1129.",
