The energy, the chants, the sea of Madridistas \u2014 it felt like being part of something way bigger than just a game. When the anthem played and the players walked out, I legit had goosebumps. \ud83e\udd0d\n\nAs for the game itself \u2014 intense, fast, and full of moments that reminded me why I fell in love with this team. The way we controlled possession, that modricismo midfield magic, and the passion on every tackle\u2026 you could feel the badge was heavy with pride. And of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a Real Madrid match without a bit of drama \ud83d\ude05\n\nWin or lose, I\u2019ll never forget this experience. For anyone who hasn\u2019t seen Madrid live yet: do it. It\u2019s more than football.\n\nHala Madrid y Nada M\u00e1s! \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udcaa",

Man, If I was Endrick I would be sick worried about my role. \n\nIt should be illegal to have Fede, Tchoua, Jude and Fran in the same team, it looks like there's 2 of each of them playing. Everywhere on the field ! \ud83d\udc4f\n\nI know this is gonna trigger a lot of you, but Vini was our worst player up front today, and has been for the past few games , minus the one against Leipzig!!!",

        "content": "I don't know if this even warrants a post but would like to share some things I noticed. Vini drove me mad with his pressing. You aren't supposed to run straight to the defender but make a cover shadow and block a passing lane, otherwise you might as well not press at all. \n\nSecondly, a moment that probably not many fans will pay attention to was Tchouameni waiting for the ball to go out for a throw in and then picking it up while it's still in play. Genuinely, what the fuck.\n\nAnd how can I not mention the finale. Comfortably leading with two goals, Rudiger with an awful clearance and we concede. It's alright, hese things can happen. All cool. Mbappe with a brilliant goal and we restore the two goal lead. Now with that in mind. Tell me why Dean had to do his best Ascensio impression and miss the semifinal when he is pivotal for our ball progression. Sigh.\n\nObviously, I am being pedantic. Fran was brilliant, Goncalo with a nice finish, might as well rename the club to Real Garcia. I was enjoying the game and couldn't stop smilling until the 90th minute, something, which wasn't often the case last season. I want to highlight that while tactically we still have lot to earn, the players must also grow individually, as players. The club will continue to improve, I am sure of it, we have to be patient and we mustn't tear players down. Hala Madrid",

None were from open-play brilliance by the opponent. We\u2019re in control overall, but the defense needs to stay focused if we want to win this World Cup.",
