        "title": "What would Real Madrid have done compared to Brentford",
        "content": "Let's look at Brentford setup prior to their goal today in the premier league.\n\n1. They forced all Arsenal players to stay in their box by crowding the box. Brentford had 5 players in the box forcing Arsenal to put 8 players in the box. This resultantly freed up the wing for Brentford who had so much space.\n2. They created an overload on the flank with two players\n3. They crossed the ball.\n\nWhat would Real Madrid have done differently? Well\n1. Pass back to the midfield.\n2 Or try to get Vinicius to run past the defender. If he runs past the defender, Mbappe stays outside the box, expecting a cut back in the form of a pass not a cross.\n3. Not cross the box and try to pass their way through inside the box.\n\nThese two opposites shows why having players occupy the box will be so important in the second leg. Vini and Mbappe got on a through ball in the first leg but nothing resulted from it. We didn't get such opportunities after. \n\nIf we occupy the box with good amount of players it will force Arsenal to possibly put more players in the box and allow our wingers and RB/LB to create overload on that side. If we keep trying to pass the ball, they will maintain their shape and it will be a long frustrating night IMO. Our wingers staying wide will not be enough, it will only be enough if our wingers stay wide and Arsenal players stay inside their box. To do that, we must make them believe that a cross is coming and actually attempt crosses.\n\nAlso, Brentford forward players came back to defend. Vini and Mbappe are lazy bums who need to do better. They need to track back. We cannot let Arsenal maintain their shape all night.\n\nThoughts for second leg?",

Then though, the ball lands in front of de Luis, who tries to clear it away, but Luque blocks it again, and in the end it falls for Janneh who can finally poach it over the line \n\nHT - after the perfect start with an early lead, Atl\u00e9tico were the better team and Castilla focused on countering. Although their goal was an absolute mess, the equaliser was deserved in the end - need to do much better in the second half to finally break the streak of 6 consecutive draws\n\n46' - second half underway \n\n\ud83d\udd04 62' - Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga for Manuel \u00c1ngel \n\n\ud83d\udfe5 63' - straight red card for Chema who, after a bad first touch, turns around in an attempt to control it, and kicks his opponent straight in the stomach studs up - well deserved red for Chema, who is really letting his team down here \n\n68' - next rough challenge by Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, who sees yellow and could've seen red too if he had aimed it a few centimetres higher\n\n74' - good save by de Luis on a header from a corner by Atl\u00e9tico - it's only a matter of time until they score if this keeps up\n\n\ud83d\udd04 75' - triple sub by Ra\u00fal, Pol Fortuny, David and V\u00edctor out for Antonio David, Loren Aguado and Valde - very defensive subs to somehow secure the point\n\n\ud83d\udfe5 78' - incredible, again it's Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga who kicks the opponent high in the chest, he doesn't hit him full on, that's why it's not a straight red, but a very deserved second yellow after two reckless fouls. The team is throwing this season away after such a good phase at the start of the year \n\n82' - insane save by de Luis, who flies like in a time lapse to deny a curling effort by the Atleti attacker - I've said it before, but for me, he's the best keeper I've ever seen for Castilla, and it's not really close \n\n84' - a shot from outside the box and again de Luis is there with the save - just before, Atl\u00e9tico wanted a penalty for a pull in the box\n\n\ud83d\udd04 85' - Gonzalo off after yet another really bad match, and Ribes replaces him - 6-2-0 formation by Castilla now\n\n90'+1 - 5 minutes on top, de Luis and the other 8 poor souls left on the pitch for us are holding on as well as the situation allows them to\n\nFT - Atl\u00e9tico fail to capitalise on double numerical superiority and the game ends at 1-1 - the 9 men left on the field did everything they could, especially de Luis bailed the team out on more than one occasion, but the two sent off should hang their heads in shame. Atl\u00e9tico were the better team throughout most of the match and in the end we need to be happy with the 7th (!) draw in a row, incredible - the team will not fall back into relegation troubles with this form, but they won't have anything to do with the playoffs either if especially the attacking players don't return to form soon - on the other hand, the team is still undefeated in the entirety of 2025\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 18:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee**: \n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 2, Matchday 32\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[FEF TV](https://feftv.com) (subscription - 12.99\u20ac/month)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (5-3-2): Mario de Luis - Youssef Enr\u00edquez \u2018Yusi\u2019, Edgar Pujol, Jacobo Ram\u00f3n, Mario Rivas, David Jim\u00e9nez (75' Lorenzo Aguado) - Jos\u00e9 Maria Andr\u00e9s \u2018Chema\u2019 (63' red card), Manuel \u00c1ngel (62' Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga), Pol Fortuny (75' Antonio David) - Gonzalo Garc\u00eda (85' Quique Ribes), V\u00edctor Mu\u00f1oz (75' V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as 'Valde') \n\nBench: Diego Pi\u00f1eiro (GK), David Ruiz, Andr\u00e9s Campos, Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga.\n\nUnavailable: Fran Gonz\u00e1lez (first team call-up), Ra\u00fal Asencio (first team call-up), David Cuenca (pubalgia), C\u00e9sar Palacios (ACL tear), Jeremy de Le\u00f3n (shoulder injury). \n\nCoach: Ra\u00fal\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** DDDDD\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 9th | 42pt | 9-15-7 | 46:31\n",

        "content": "Once the lead is comfortable Alaba should come on as sub to rest players and not be rushed as a starter as we've seen in these past games. \n\nBellingham, Valverde, and Rodygo don't have the freedom to attack comfortably when Tchouameni is not in the midfield. \n\nIt lets Rudiger and Asencio to help press the wings while Tchouameni keeps the middle secure. It's basic football and this 442 Ancelotti keeps putting out is killing our attack. \n\nOur team last year with Nacho, Rudiger, Tchouameni, and Carvajal was inansely solid and only saw one loss in the league. \n\nThere has been too much of a focus from everyone on how to get the attack working, but it's clearly a defensive issue. \n\nWhen we defend well, we attack well because you can't attack if you can't win the ball. \n\nI want the team covering well and the 433 provides that when a central defensive mid is present. \n\nLet Jude push up, Fran will cover, and then Ridiger will cover Fran, and Tchouameni shifts. It's basic football. \n\nLast year we pressed and defended will with someone like Bellingham being in the first line of defense. Now we have forced him further back since we let the other team attack freely. If you need to stay back because Vazquez is a vulnerability then put in Valverde play Modric in midfield and press. Idk what Ancelotti is doing. The defense was in shambles, but the revelation of Asencio saved his season, but he refused to take full advantage of him.  \n\nIt was no surprise that when Ceballos started playing in that holding role we started improving and playing better. Now just image a 1.88m defensive midfilder with top defensive skills from suffering the pain of playing as a defender for most of this season playing regularly in that holding position. Tchouameni has to play there. And when you need a goal late game, throw Tchouameni in the box. \n\nScoring more goals than the other team is the goal and this sudden focus on staying back, and being conservative is pointless and a mistake. \n\n",

But my believe is, to be successful in the long run an to win titles, the attack needs to be complementary - and the three are simply not.\n\nLet\u2019s face it: In their core they are all LW and in particular Vini &amp; Mbapp\u00e9s strenghts (and weaknesses) are too similar. In contrast (and I hate to say that) look at Barcas Raphina, Lewa &amp; LY, how they fit perfectly together and tick all the boxes an attack has to from my point of view.\n\nThe ugly truth in my opinion is: Unfortunately one of them has to go. I have an unpopular opinion who  that should be, but what do you think: Will we win titles with the three? ",

        "title": "There seems to be a prevailing opinion blaming Alaba for yesterday's defeat",
        "content": "I disagree with that. While Alaba wasn't exemplary, I don't think he did that bad &amp; I believe the blame should be directed towards others.\n\nAlaba wasn't bad yesterday except for the foul on Saka that resulted in a goal from the free kick.\nHe kept Saka under control, and the only time Saka went through the defense was when Alaba went over to mark Odegaard and left Saka to bellingham. Saka went through bellingham easily and Alaba tried to sprint back. Luckily, Saka just crossed the ball, and it resulted in nothing.\n\nNow, let's talk about Alaba's tackle on Saka that resulted in the goal:\nThis tackle was made far from Alaba's position. He had to cover for the fact that certain midfielders were not doing much defensive duty (Camavinga in particular). Camavinga made a tackle in this similar position in Saka later in the match, and what do you know? He almost got red carded &amp; resulted in the 2nd goal for Declan.\n\nThe third goal was also the result of shambolic defensive midfield performance. There was far too free space for the opponents, and I don't know what to say about it. But you can see what I'm getting at.\n\n\nNow to the other question:\nWhy was the midfield easily overrun against Arsenal? I believe the answer is:\n\n1. They were outnumbered because our front line failed to fall back and support them, particularly in the 2nd half.\n2. Modric doesn't have the lungs anymore, and Valverde wasn't in the midfield to compensate for that.\n3. Camavinga is tactically illiterate and has zero sense of where to position himself. This is why he's been so bad this season. The man failed to improve since his first season. In fact, I think there's a good case for saying that he has regressed.\n4. Bellingham's workrate seems to have been worsening game after game. Particularly since January.\n\nThis is why Ceballos was so effective when played and manage to help this midfield immensely.\nHe has better tactical sense &amp; decision making, better passing range, and at least a similar workrate to Camavinga. We need Ceballos in that midfield.\n\nI do not understand how a coach like ancelotti, who went through something similar to this in 2014/2015, doesn't see this.",
