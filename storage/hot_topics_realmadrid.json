        "title": "Breakdown of the Vini saga - for those refusing to understand",
        "content": "Vini is underperforming, yes. But it's not the main reason the fans are turning on him. Some people don't want to understand that, and play the \"loyalty\" song and dance as if he's just underperforming a bit. And even if they do understand, they point fingers at other players and do the \"what about\" song and dance.\n\nLast year Vini's behavior got so bad that it directly resulted in our defences being caught out and being scored on... Losing the ball constantly due to egotistic 1v3 attempts, falling on his ass and complaining/gesticulating instead of trying to run back and helping his teammates defend a counter that HE caused.\n\nHow many times did we see an overlapping run from our LB, Vini waiting for the LB to run past him, deciding not to pass to the LB and instead running into three defenders to play the \"hero\" and prove to everyone he deserved the ballon d'Or? He of course always proceeded to lose the ball, and then our opponents had all that free space on their right wing to run into. I've seen this movie more times than I care for.\n\nHow many times have we seen him take a shot when a much better passing option was available? How many times we've seen him get into dick measuring contests with the opposing players and fans, showing \"2 CL titles\" to them etc instead of focusing on his football. More times then I care for.\n\nAfter the ballon d'or snub, he said he'll try 10x harder. He definitely tried 10x harder to make it about himself.\n\nHis presence on the pitch was obviously influenced by his need to prove that he's the guy - instead of focusing on the team's needs. Vulnerable ego, responding to all taunts and any percieved attacks. We were all forgiving for a while because he's a club legend. But after a few months of that, and no end in sight, people started looking to Carlo to perhaps bench his star or tell him to get his act together. Carlo did no such thing. Vini was untouchable.\n\nOnce Xabi came in we saw a more team oriented Vini for a while. Less rolling around on the floor, less mouthing off, higher work rate and helping out in defence. Maybe Vini didn't score a lot of goals, but we were winning as a team.\n\nThen the Classico happened and the dam had broken. Vini could no longer hold it in. He was not the star anymore and he couldn't bear the embarrassment of being taken off. Everything that happened since has been a cascade of that moment. Results started suffering at that point, Vini's attitude started stinking often etc.\n\nLoking back, seeing how there seems to be a cult built around Vini in our club, can you really blame Xabi for trying to \"stay alive\" and play it nice? Not that it helped him ultimately. \n\nThe club seems to be talking about Vini as if there's something they know that we don't. They seem to completely ignore the fact fans have a problem with a selfish attitude that hurts the team, and instead focus on \"his ability\" and coddling him to greatness again. This is extremely concerning given his contract negotiation situation, and the fact he's asking for an astronomical salary.\n\nFans were booing Vini and Florentino, and making their voices heard because of that. Fans that mostly happen to be the owners of this institution, mind you.\n\nSo when someone simplifies this whole saga to a single factor of Vini just being slightly out of form, they are being disingenuous. They support the individual over the needs of the squad. Nobody else would get such special treatment, and that's a fact.\n\nThe fact the rest of the footballing world can clearly see where the issue at Real Madrid is, while our board is doubling down is even more frustrating.\n\nThe issue is not an underperforming player. It's a self centered individual, who the club seems keen on indulging and coddling, while a massive contract extension in the works could prove to be a massive mistake from a sporting and financial standpoint.",

(not questioning his abilities)\n\ndo we make lunin our first choice goalkeeper or sign someone else? I personally think lunin has shown that he belongs here and is amazing if not world class himself, the 23/24 ucl campaign was a proof of it, and tbh there will not be any big names on the market anytime soon. lunin\u2019s contract with madrid is until 2030 so im hoping he is here to stay, and start.",

        "content": "I understand why some people think Arbeloa\u2019s constant praise of Vini is a bit weird or over the top. But honestly, I think it\u2019s very intentional and very pragmatic.\n\nVini\u2019s confidence is clearly at a low point right now, and like it or not, this team still needs him firing if we want to win anything meaningful this season. Everything is still wide open, especially with Barca dropping points. The margins at Real Madrid are always thin, and when Vini is hesitant or mentally checked out, our attack looks predictable and toothless.\n\nYes, the criticism he\u2019s getting is fair. His decision-making hasn\u2019t been great, his body language hasn\u2019t helped, and he hasn\u2019t always responded well to pressure. But singling him out endlessly doesn\u2019t help the team. At this stage of the season, it\u2019s not about who was right or wrong, it\u2019s about putting players in the best position to perform.\n\nI genuinely think Arbeloa is trying to protect and empower Vini, not because he\u2019s blind to his flaws, but because he understands how crucial Vini is when he\u2019s confident and decisive. Whether you\u2019re a Vini defender or a critic, the reality is the same: if he plays well, Madrid\u2019s chances improve dramatically.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to like him. You don\u2019t have to excuse everything he does. But right now, backing him is simply the most pragmatic move for the team\u2019s success, and that\u2019s probably all Arbeloa is doing.",

        "content": "Assuming you had everyone available, what do you think is the best setup for the team? I would say 4-3-3, or some variety of 442. 3-5-2 could be nice but we don\u2019t have enough reliable center backs to be playing 3 of them at a time frankly. \n\nMbappe - Gonzalo - Rodrygo\n\nJude- Arda \n\nTchouameni\n\nCarreras- (Militao) / Dean - Asencio - (Trent) / Fede\n\nThibaut\n\nCaveat being that against high press/higher quality attacking teams you start Camavinga over G\u00fcler. \n\nI\u2019d say the biggest question mark is that third center mid spot, Arda seems best to have in there against a low block as he helps with unlocking it and creating chances. Camavinga performances have ranged from very good to terrible, and Fede has largely been average at best when played in the midfield this season. Ceballos occasionally looks like he could help as a Deep-lying playmaker and other times looks out of his depth. \n\nAlternatively you play Mbappe and Gonzalo up top, and a diamond midfield with Jude, Arda, Tchou, and Rodrygo",

Feeling happy for Endrick is fine, but we must understand that he is still a very raw and needs a refreshment for his career, not sitting on the bench for the turtle and Gonzalo (who has scored 5 goals since new year, pretty impressive for an academy prospect).\n\nAnd imagine if Mastantuono being loaned out and cooked like Endrick or Paz, this fanbase will cry like a baby and spam endless \"If\" questions.",

        "content": "First, we all know our Right Wing is weak. We have mastantuono who is still lacking a lot. We also have Brahim, who is good, but is incredibly inconsistent. So, our main problem is the right flank. We could easily fix this, but for some reason we don\u2019t. First, Mbappe can play on the Right Wing. He has played there more than he has on the left. He played throughout his early PSG career, up to 2019 in the right flank. Many claim he can\u2019t, but he very much can. But, let\u2019s say Mbappe wants to stay as a ST. Then we would have to bring Endrick back, and play him as a RW. Who also played a lot as a RW before coming to Madrid. You just need to watch him play to know his quality and how capable he is of playing Right Wing. Our Front Three could easily be Vini, Mbappe, Endrick. We could rotate them with Rodrygo, Gonzalo and Brahim. We would have good competition, and we would be utilizing Endrick who is a great talent.\n\nEdit: I prefer Rodrygo way more, but the board won\u2019t bench Vini.",
