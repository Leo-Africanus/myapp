Also one of the best players from Austria ever, with the only other option being Bican who j never saw.\n\nAt Madrid he has had a legendary moment with the chair. Was a worthy replacement of Ramos! We did not feel like we were lacking in defence, granted Ramos' availability was minimal in his final season. He also joined on a free transfer, although on a long term deal with massive wages. Starter in a UCL winning campaign in 21/22 and part way through 23/24. \n\nHe might not be the greatest center back in out history, but the man deserves more respect. I feel like people have just forgotten him and hence don't like him, I say this because of all the negative sentiment i see towards him in this sub. Perhaps the remainder of this season plus the next will be vital in defining his legacy. But even if he's a 4th choice for the rest of his time here, I think he was a useful player who played at a very high level albeit for a short period of time. ",

        "content": "And yes, I'll address the elephant in the room. We do have some successful academy players on our team. But let's be real, is Lucas Vazquez really the representation we want of La Fabrica? Does he really illustrate the type of talent we produce? Shout out to Carvajal tho.\n\nWhen assessing the effectiveness of Castilla, we must look at what the goal of La Fabrica is. Is La Fabrica's mission to pump out talent that we can sell for a good profit or is it to produce talent that will eventually play with the first team? Madrid has had little success in both departments compared to our rivals. \nAlthough I don't think we should be taking any financial lessons from Barca, it should be noted that their academy players often sign for big clubs and turn over a big profit. According to transfermarkt, 3 out of the top 4 most valuable former Barca academy players currently play for the team. Not only are they producing talent, they are retaining talent. Can Madrid implement these same strategies and what's preventing us from doing so already? Is the issue with Ancelotti's lack of academy player selection or is it the foundation of the organization that's inhibiting players' ability to grow? I personally think it could be both. \n\n \nMaybe the issue is the essence of Castilla itself. For me, Castilla has always felt like the \"I wasn't good enough to make it to the first team\" vibe and not the \"this is a stepping stone to make it to the first team\" vibe. It's almost as if players get stuck in Castilla purgatory and can't move their way up.\nIt seems as though the only time academy players get opportunities is if someone is injured. The only reason Raul Asencio is playing is because of our defensive injuries, and he might lose his spot once Militao and Carvajal return (and possible TAA arrival). How can we ensure that quality academy players get quality playing time for the first team? I think it's do-able but it would require us to shift our focus from international to home grown talent. It would also require Ancelotti making selections based off merit/performance and not vibes. Only Saddam Hussein knows if that will happen though. \n\nThe biggest question of it all: does it really matter? How crucial is La Fabrica and Castilla to the first team's success? Is it possible we are simply better off buying talent from somewhere else than producing our own? ",

        "title": "With TAA joining, how should we line up in 2025/26?",
        "content": "I know we never did well play with 3 at the back, but i feel it is Xabi's preference if he comes. Carlo most likely to stick with 433 but two issues with that, Jude can't be as involved in the box, and we don't have the midfield dominance we used to have with Kroos. \n\nTchouameni and Camavinga needed to step up this season and take on a leadership role. Camavinga has been very error prone and despite all his press resistance he caused like 2 penalties this season and a number of errors in back passes that cost us dearly. As a LB/LWB in my opinion he is one of the best in the world and very complimentary to Vini. \n\nTchouameni's defensive positioning has been horrible, and he doesn't have the pace to make up for it, he might actually be an 8 rather than a 6. He plays better for France, but France's overall level has been worse since Qatar. \n\nI feel three at the back provides the most balance, TAA's passing can bring back switching of the field to Vini which we've missed since Carvajal's injury, and Ceballos seems more crucial than ever. \n\nVery excited at the prospect of Dean Huijsen and Miguel Guti joining, Mendy is expired, and Fran is no more than a back up. Thoughts?",
