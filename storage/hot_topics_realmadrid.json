Against Tunisia he got 34 accurate passes (97%), 5 duels won, 1 tackle won, rated 7.6. \n\nWe have 2 world class LWs in Vini and Rodrygo. No reason to just let one rot in the bench when there's plenty of opportunity to let both play, especially when Vini is inconsistent in his performances these days. Competition breeds improvement. We have to encourage it.\n\nAlso Gonzalo Garcia scored against Romania. He's a talented striker with good positioning &amp; he's a better aerial threat than most of our players. We should be subbing him in at the 70th minute or so if Mbappe isn't performing, or against low blocks, where we could use a conventional #9 to cross to.",

There are a lot of candidates to be a solid RW option (Rodrygo, Valverde, Guler, Brahim, Mastantuono), but so far, none are considered elite on that position.\n\nWho do you consider \u201celite\u201d/significant upgrade if we signed them today? I can\u2019t think of many options outside of Saka, Palmer, Dembele, Yamal, Olise (latter two not proven across multiple seasons). Estevao looks promising. \n\nWho else would you consider elite? ",
