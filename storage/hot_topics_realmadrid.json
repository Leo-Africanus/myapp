We always have to get bailed out by players like Jude, Vini, Tbo, Fede, Rodrygo...etc.\n\n**This shows how amazing our players are and how weak we are as a TEAM.**\n\nI can't remember a single game this season and the majority of last season where we actually outclassed an opponent as a team. \n\n The fact that some of our players can create a goal out of nothing is fantastic but when we depend on individual players to change the fate of the game and they are not able to show up in that game is why we were unable to replicate the success we had previously.\n\nEven if we somehow managed to sign trent and a CB this window, it does not solve the biggest problem we have which is that do not play well as a team.\n\n",

        "content": "Vini's case is more complex and nuanced that football fans and all the passion involved (both for and against clubs and players) are used to dealing with.\n\n* Vini started here as a relatively shy boy with lots of talent but little end product. Many used to laugh at him for his performances. It was clear that the world was still too big for him, and he worked in silence.\n* Then he developed massively and became one of the best players in the world, especially in the Champions League. He gained confidence and started expressing himself, especially during goal celebrations. What was an easy target for jokes became a serious threat against most teams, and so, opposition fans began to antagonize him more.\n* His expression of the (broadly speaking, of course) Brazilian black culture, like dancing, the haircuts and so on, didn't bode well for a significant part of Spain, which **does have** racism problems. Of course, I'm not targeting every single Spanish person, but this is a very clear problem.\n* Vini plays for the biggest club in Spain, a club that's used to beat most if not all other teams in the league. When someone beats you, you tend to dislike them and what the do to a certain point. What could already be viewed by some as a disrespect to the opponents (the dances, dribbling and so on) became more exacerbated by Vini's skin color. And so, Vini became a target for criticisms that border racism or were fully racist.\n* Not as shy as before, Vini faced this head on, seeking criminal sentences for those who abused him, which made his \"opposition\" even angrier, who started targeting him more, and he became more affected by this as well, which is natural.\n* This situation began to affect him on the pitch. It was rare to see Vini involving himself in fights against another players or referees before 2021/2022, but today this is extremely common. The abuse affected his head and he can't seem to control it. This only serves as fuel for neutrals to dislike Vini and, of course, for those who already hated him to do so even more.\n* This has factually affected the votings on the Ballon D'Or, something that Vini clearly wanted to him. Some will point out structural racism as the problem, while others will say that Vini doesn't behave well enough. Usually, one side never agrees with the other. The root of all of this seem to be lost in people's minds at this point.\n\nIt's a very delicate situation. We can't solely put the blame on Vini for the things that he does, because most players don't deal with what he does, but he's not blameless either. I just hope that he can get some serious professional help because it seems to be getting worse.",

Los Blancos face Celta Vigo in the Copa del Rey on Thursday night, but the Galician side were barely mentioned in the aftermath of the Clasico.\n\nAncelotti was heavily criticised in the hours following their 5-2 defeat, but noted that it was just one game, and his side was still in all of their other competitions, and in good position to win them. One of the things he did highlight about the Clasico was that his side lacked \u2018team commitment.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe lack of commitment is collective, it is not an individual commitment. The evaluation of the match has been a poor defensive plan in all areas of the pitch. Nothing more to add.\u201d\n\nOn several occasions he was asked to diagnose the issues that led to their second heavy defeat to Barcelona of the season.\n\n\u201cI have to clarify one thing, this is a press conference and not a debate. We have already had that with our players and the coaching staff. Doing it here does not seem like the most appropriate thing to me.\u201d",

        "title": "What did we do with the ball against Barcelona? A first half nightmare review",
        "content": "# Introduction:\n\nI tortured myself by rewatching our recent game against Barcelona. I just wanted to count the number of long balls we threw away. I left you here a \"play-by-play\" of our possessions, and how Bar\u00e7a ended theirs. No need to read all of it unless you want to do it while watching/reviewing the game yourself. The play-by-play could also serve as a point to discuss a particular play. Then a little comment about the second half. Finally, a soft conclusion based on the play-by-play.\n\n# Play by play:\n\n**(1:25)** Recovered ball from Gavi by Camavinga and Vini on our left side in Bar\u00e7a\u2019s half, close to the half-line (good pressing). Valverde immediately loses the ball (Camavinga passed it to Jude, who passed it back to Fede), which allows Bar\u00e7a to counterattack and Courtois has to save Lamine\u2019s shot from outside the box. What a save to start the match (**!!**).\n\n**(2:48)** Goal-kick, Lamine tried too many dribbles. Tchouam\u00e9ni short pass to Courtois, who throws a long ball. **1st gift**.\n\n**(3:05)** Good press, Mbapp\u00e9 (**!**) is able to cut \u00cd\u00f1igo\u2019s pass to Casad\u00f3 in Bar\u00e7a\u2019s half. Ball goes to Bellingham who passes it to Vinicius. He miserably loses the possession.\n\n**(3:50)** Bar\u00e7a touches the ball comfortably while we look at them (14 passes, none challenged) until Gavi gains the goal-line and puts a cross for Raphinha, who heads it to the goal as he is completely alone. Courtois\u2019 second save, an impressive one (**!!**).\n\n**(4:20)** Bar\u00e7a\u2019s corner is bad, Vinicius wins the ball against Casad\u00f3 and gives it to Mbapp\u00e9, who makes a 70m run to score. **Golazo, 1-0**.\n\n**(6:05)** Rodrygo deflects \u00cd\u00f1igo\u2019s pass and the ball meekly arrives to Tchouam\u00e9ni. To R\u00fcdiger, to Courtois\u2026 and bam. Long ball to nowhere (Bar\u00e7a\u2019s GK hands). **2nd**.\n\n**(6:47)** Mendy cuts a pass and kicks the ball to Mbapp\u00e9. Play? Mbapp\u00e9 runs and almost gets injured by Kound\u00e9. The fucking Gil Manzano asshole doesn\u2019t call the clear yellow foul.\n\n**(9:05)** New goal-kick, after Raphinha's shot (he had a very narrow angle, but Barcelona only needed 4 passes to end their play inside our area with a dangerous shot). We are one man down because Mbapp\u00e9 is receiving medical attention. Our play? Tchouam\u00e9ni short pass to Courtois, who sends another long ball. Directly to Cubars\u00ed. **3rd**. Bar\u00e7a is unable to control the possession, tho, and we get a throw-in.\n\n**(9:25)** For the first time, we string more than one pass (**!**). Mendy to Vini, who switches to Lucas. Back to Courtois. Lobbed ball to Mendy, who controls and passes it to Camavinga. Camavinga is pressed by Lewandowski (**!!**) and has to pass it back to Courtois, who sends a lobbed ball to Mendy again. This time, Mendy has to head it\u2026 and Kound\u00e9 gets the ball in our own third of the pitch, with many meters in front of him to freely control and advance, despite of being close to our area (**!!**). Not exactly an unforced long ball but...\n\n**(10:18)** After Lamine dribbles two of our players, Valverde finally stops him in the border of our box\u2026 Valverde himself throws a long ball to nowhere after his recovery.\n\n**(10:38)** For once, the idea of raffling the ball serves us, as our pressing on the second ball is able to force Bar\u00e7a\u2019s mistake. Casad\u00f3 stops any further danger with a fast foul on Camavinga. Our free kick resulted in nothing and Camavinga stops the counter with a foul. *1st time the long ball gives us \u201csomething\u201d*.\n\n**(12:08)** Rodrygo wins the duel against Balde on our right side in our own third, recovering the ball. He gets us a throw-in.\n\n**(??:??)** Cameras didn\u2019t show what happened, but we sent another long ball, as Barcelona pressed the throw-in. I guess it wasn't a gift, but\u2026 Bar\u00e7a got the ball. The defense in the following possession is as passive as it can get, Pedri enters our area jogging. Fortunately, Lucas finally blocks his advance. Throw-in.\n\n**(13:12)** Rodrygo and Lucas win the ball against Balde and Pedri, close to our right corner after the throw-in. Another one, this time for us.\n\n**(13:30)** Valverde puts the ball in orbit. It's forced since Bar\u00e7a is high pressing. \u00cd\u00f1igo\u2019s missed control let us make a fast play through our right side, as Bellingham finds Rodrygo with open space to run. After a couple of dribbles, he switches the ball to Vinicius, who crosses to the area looking for Bellingham, but the ball directly goes to Bar\u00e7a\u2019s GK. Our idea of play is clear. Kick the ball and hope the opponent makes a mistake. What a masterplan.\n\n**(14:30)** Rodrygo cuts a pass (from the \u201cmagician\u201d Pedri to Balde) in our own third, as we had let Barcelona freely advance (10 passes). Our counterattack? It lasts 3 passes, and that\u2019s counting Rodrygo\u2019s cut as the first one.\n\n**(14:49)** Mbapp\u00e9 lies on the ground, his foot is damaged. Fucking Gil Manzano and fucking Barcelona ignores the issue as much as they can (10 seconds, actually).\n\n**(17:02)** Game is resumed after two minutes. Despite of being one man down with 1-0 in our favor and the rest of the team holding back in a low block, Bellingham decides that it is a good idea to press. Useless efforts, obviously; we should be more clever. Fortunately, he realizes about the situation soon. Bar\u00e7a tries a play we will \u201clike\u201d: a player (Raphinha) moves, offering himself to receive the ball, while a second one (Pedri) runs into the space left by the first player. It\u2019s 2025 and we don\u2019t know how to fucking defend this simple play (**!!**). This time, it only ends in a corner, as Tchouam\u00e9ni deflects Pedri\u2019s shot.\n\n**(18:40)** Casad\u00f3\u2019s shot is off, goal-kick. You know the play. Tchouam\u00e9ni to Courtois. Long ball. At least this time Bellingham is able to control the ball before losing it. **4th gift**.\n\n**(20:22)** After a couple of non-dangerous plays (one corner, tho) in which we can\u2019t recover the ball but clear it, another goal-kick. You know the play. **5th gift**. To make things worst, after we passively watched their build up, Lewandowski moves to receive the ball, R\u00fcdiger leaves a hole in our back line and Lamine wins Mendy\u2019s back. Like I said, it\u2019s 2025 and we are defending like amateurs. Bar\u00e7a only needed 7 passes to destroy whatever shit mid block we pretended to set. Only 2 of those 7 passes were actually forward passes (**!!!**): Kound\u00e9 (alone!) to Lewandowski (alone!), to Lamine (alone!). **1-1, ridiculous defense**. R\u00fcdiger and Mendy are abysmal, the general passivity is horrible to watch.\n\n**(22:18)** After the goal, we build up from the back. For the first time, we string more than 10 (**!!**) passes (before, we hit 7 passes at the 9:25 play). Great, right? Almost all happen between Courtois, Tchouam\u00e9ni and Lucas. On the 11th pass the ball arrives to R\u00fcdiger\u2026 and he kicks it away. Fortunately, Szczesny is clumsy and concedes a throw-in. *I guess we can count it as the 2nd time an unforced long ball works*.\n\n**(23:00)** Decent fast play, we get a corner kick.\n\n**(23:40)** Szczesny saves Tchoaum\u00e9ni\u2019s header. New corner.\n\n**(24:01)** Casad\u00f3 clears the ball, another corner.\n\n**(24:23)** Tchouam\u00e9ni\u2019s half bycicle kick. Cleared ball goes to Camavinga, who passes it back to Mendy, who does the same, to Courtois\u2026 When the ball arrives to Courtois, Bar\u00e7a\u2019s offside is almost in the half-line. Our players? 5 are clear offside (they were also offside when Mendy had the ball!!), with Rodrygo in a doubtful position, next to our right sideline. Search a picture at 24:36 mark\u2026\u00a0 It\u2019s\u2026 Fuck. FUCK. Courtois, of course, sends a long ball. Throw-in for Bar\u00e7a, but it would have been an offside. **6th**.\n\n**(25:21)** R\u00fcdiger wins the ball after a deep pass to Raphinha. He passes it to Lucas, who makes a stupidly risky pass to Courtois. Fortunately, the Belgium reaches the ball before Lamine and kicks it away. It\u2019s not as unforced as others, but **7th** in my count.\n\n**(25:55)** Cubars\u00ed makes a terrible pass thanks to our pressing. It goes directly to Fede. The Uruguayan is a gentleman and passes it back\u2026 to Lamine.\n\n**(26:35)** After Bar\u00e7a\u2019s rondo (12 passes, barely challenged), Kound\u00e9 appears completely alone (Vini?) on their right and shots from outside of the box. R\u00fcdiger blocks it and Vini starts a counterattack. He tries to dribble through Kound\u00e9, Pedri and Cubars\u00ed in the half-line. If my mother had been around, he would have also tried to dribble her. At least the rebound favors us and we can build from the back more calmly. **(26:58)** \u00cd\u00f1igo injured.\n\n**(28:12)** Game resumed. A few passes between our back line before Lucas sends a long pass. Casad\u00f3 heads it but Valverde wins the second chance. Our masterplan firing at full cylinders. Valverde\u2019s ball goes to Mbapp\u00e9, who opens it to Vini. Then, Vini\u2019s deep pass goes directly to Ara\u00fajo. Peak football. *Third time our masterplan gets us \u201csomething\u201d*.\n\n**(28:46)** Mbapp\u00e9 presses Kound\u00e9, who concedes a throw-in. R\u00fcdiger and Tchouam\u00e9ni pass the ball to each other a couple of times. Surprisingly, we don\u2019t send a long ball (**!**). I guess they could see several players in offside (**!!**). Finally, a forward pass from our back line to our midfield pivots, when we are almost at 30th minute (**!!!**): Tchouam\u00e9ni to Camavinga. It happens that Camavinga is actually Raphinha. I guess now we know why we were kicking away the ball.\n\n**(29:08)** Fortunately, instead of capitalizing the chance, Raphinha slows the play trying to dribble Camavinga, who makes his only good play of the match and wins the ball. It goes to Lucas, who gives it to Fede\u2026 and another long ball to nowhere. **8th** unforced long ball missed.\n\n**(29:26)** Kound\u00e9 turns back the favor, and Mendy controls the ball. He fast find Mbapp\u00e9, who dribbles past Kound\u00e9 and Gavi\u2026 just to try to dribble them again towards our goal. I don\u2019t really understand, but Bar\u00e7a gets the ball back.\u00a0\n\n**(29:45)** Lamine is feeling generous himself and gives away the possession in the half-line, as he also tries impossible dribbles. We don\u2019t elaborate much, but Camavinga finds Mbapp\u00e9 open on the left side. Then a deep pass to Vini\u2019s run, who does a good play on the wing (**!**). His cross is cleared, and Camavinga shots the ball to the skies in the second chance.\n\n**(31:47)** We get a throw-in near our area thanks to Mendy\u2019s good defense on Kound\u00e9; we didn\u2019t suffer, but it took us 1min 30s to get the possession back. Play? Mendy hands the ball to R\u00fcdiger, who sends a long pass to Vini. Ara\u00fajo easily wins the duel (**9th**). Back to defend, in a low block. (32:45) Our very passive defense (24 passes, interrupted once by a R\u00fcdiger clearance, his header immediately went to Bar\u00e7a as they were much better positioned and active) let Kound\u00e9 receive the ball on the side (Vinicius watches Kound\u00e9 from distance, walking), his cross to Gavi results in Camavinga\u2019s penalty and a yellow card after a VAR review. Camavinga\u2019s amateur level and our passivity (both in general and Vinicius in particular) **give Bar\u00e7a the 1-2**. I don\u2019t know if we don\u2019t have attitude or we don\u2019t have legs (both, I guess), but our level is mediocre.\n\n**(37:05)** After the goal, Mbapp\u00e9 to Camavinga, back to Tchouam\u00e9ni, to R\u00fcdiger, to Courtois. You know the play. *One of the rare occasions in which we win the second chance ball (4th), it let us advance and create danger*. However, Mbapp\u00e9 is clearly offside (**!!**) when Lucas crosses the ball into the area, so even if Szczesny hadn\u2019t caught the ball, nothing. Sometimes, you inexplicably find yourself offside; I reject to make further comments about this play.\n\n**(38:13)** After Bar\u00e7a makes a few passes, Cubars\u00ed sends a long ball to Lamine, but it goes directly to Courtois\u2019 hands. Play? Ball to Tchouam\u00e9ni, who gives it back to the GK. Under the pressure of 37 years old Lewandowski (**!!**), Courtois has to throw another long ball. **10th, this time, it directly costs us a goal**. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/realmadrid/comments/1i0biuo/comment/m6zbdnu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) is the full sequence of the coming events\u2026 **1-3**. Blame on Lucas (unfair), but it\u2019s impossible for him to recover the distance with Raphinha. Blame on Tchouam\u00e9ni (fair), who decides to worry about Lewandowski instead of Raphinha. **But not knowing what to do with the ball is what is harming us. Who is responsible for that?**\n\n**(39:52)** After the goal, we make a few passes till the ball goes back to Courtois. Result? After a couple of duels, throw-in for Bar\u00e7a. **11th**.\n\n**(43:30)** Cameras were repeating Bar\u00e7a\u2019s third goal while we started our play with a goal-kick after Lewandowski headed the ball out (he required medical services); it was a clear chance for them, our passive defense let Raphinha get the ball inside our area to put the cross. Another possession immediately given away with a long ball, this time to Szczesny\u2019s hands. **12th**.\u00a0\n\n**(45:47)** After Bar\u00e7a\u2019s played with us for 2 fucking minutes (we conceded a throw-in and committed two fouls between plays), in which Gil Manzano saved Camavinga of a clear second yellow when he hugged Lamine (**!!**), Balde miscontrols the ball in his run and Lucas gets it. Casad\u00f3 cuts any chance of a counterattack by fast fouling Bellingham. It is a clear yellow, but Gil Manzano ignores it as he ignored Camavinga\u2019s.\n\n**(46:09)** Play after the foul? For once, we don\u2019t pass it back to Courtois. Tchouam\u00e9ni opens it for Valverde on the right side\u2026 And he throws a long ball, directly to Szczesny\u2019s hands. **13th**. It\u2019s pointless to say anything.\n\n**(47:17)** We get the possession back as Lamine is offside, almost in the half-line. We comfortably touch the ball, as Bar\u00e7a lower their pressing a bit with a 1-3 in their favor and the halftime closing in. We don\u2019t advance much, but we aren\u2019t forced to pass it back to Courtois. **(47:59)** After 40s of timid passes with little intention, R\u00fcdiger sends a long ball behind Bar\u00e7a\u2019s defensive line. Result? Szczesny gets it. **14th**. Sigh.\n\n**(48:43)** We are unable to recover the possession till Mendy blocks Lamine\u2019s shot. Vini fights with Casad\u00f3, wins the ball and searches Mbapp\u00e9, who has to slow down the play and switches to the right side. Bellingham, Rodrygo and Lucas create a decent play that ends with Balde making a bad clearance. Gavi heads the ball to Szczesny, who catches it in two efforts, as Rodrygo cannot properly connect with it.\n\n**(50:36)** R\u00fcdiger cuts a pass with his head (Gavi kicks him in the face in that play, but Gil Manzano ignores it). The ball goes to Bellingham, who makes a run. He is fouled by Kound\u00e9 (but Gil Manzano ignores it). The following play is Barcelona doing a rondo (16 passes) as our forwards are wasted and don\u2019t defend at all. It ends in a corner for Bar\u00e7a as Courtois makes his third impressive save (**!!**) of the day to Balde\u2019s shot.\n\n**(52:03)** Courtois directly gets the ball from Raphinha\u2019s corner-kick. He hands it to Rodrygo, but Casad\u00f3 is too fast and stops the counter before it starts. Throw-in for us.\n\n**(52:14)** Rodrygo tries to advance through the right, but Casad\u00f3 fouls him.\n\n**(53:13)** We take the foul with a long cross to the area. After some rebounds, the ball arrives to Valverde, who opens it to Rodrygo, still on the right after taking the foul. He dribbles, but eventually he and Lucas find no space and pass it back to Fede, who switches it again. Mendy and Mbapp\u00e9 advance through the left and Ara\u00fajo concedes a corner. Bloody corner.\n\n**(54:15)** Rodrygo took our previous three corners, from our right side, directly to the area (**!!**). They were dangerous. This time, Camavinga offers himself for a short pass. Why? I don\u2019t know, but Rodrygo decides it\u2019s a good idea, despite stoppage time is over. Camavinga\u2019s pass to Rodrygo is quite bad, but Rodrygo\u2019s pass is even worse, as it directly goes to Lamine. The rest is an easy counterattack for Barcelona that ends with **an unsurmountable 1-4** and the feeling we can receive 4 or 5 more goals in the second half.\u00a0\n\n# Second half:\n\nIf the first half is a calamity, the second half is even worse. We played 40 minutes with one more player and it looked like we were the ones with one less man. Against 11 we only threw long balls. Against 10, we didn\u2019t create any real chance, bar a couple of fantastic Mbapp\u00e9 actions in stoppage time: one missed by Bellingham, one saved by Pe\u00f1a.\u00a0\n\n# Conclusion:\n\n18 unforced long balls. 4 of them served us to advance thanks to the second option ball, but nothing else. 14 times were gifts to Bar\u00e7a, one of them turned into the third goal against us. If I'm not mistaken, we disputed a single aerial duel from these balls, the rest went directly to Bar\u00e7a. Were we hoping Bar\u00e7a failed? Was our plan to throw long ball after long ball? A total failure at all levels, whether it was planned or not. \n\nAnd makes me wonder, if we were doing that, why didn't we put pressure on Bar\u00e7a's half with more men? Why did we start our goal-kicks with a short pass (with 6 of our players close to our area) instead of a direct long ball? I don't share that plan as I think we have the capacity to build up plays from the back without raffling the ball, but if we are going to throw long balls... try to find Jude or Tchouam\u00e9ni and support it with our players around them, don't put most of our guys next to Courtois.\n\nBesides the \"countless\" gifts, the rest of our possessions mainly consisted on impossible runs just after we recovered the ball. Yes, one of these \"recovery and run\" plays allowed us to score the first goal, but it must be noticed that it happened after a Bar\u00e7a corner, not when they were structured.\n\nI don't know if it's a coaching problem, an attitude problem, a tiredness problem, the height of the grass or the temperature of the seas, but we didn't know what to do with the fucking ball. And it's not the first, nor the second, nor the third time it happens this season.\n\nThis is just regarding what we did with the possession. The grotesque show we performed without the ball would require gasoline and fire. \n\nFortunately, this was a tinpot trophy and we are still alive in the important titles. I think we should still trust in our team stepping up when it matters the most (Champions League knockouts and Liga), even if they failed last weekend. \n\nHala Madrid!",

There's no way a manager is hired and is successful in top elite teams, winning more UCL than any other manager in history, and not know tactics.\n\nYou might not like them, you might want a Guardiola or Cholo just yelling the whole game, micromanaging the team (for real or for show), but that doesn't mean Ancelotti doesn't analyze the game.\n\nThis season, there's a clear disconnect between what's needed and what happens on the field. There are many possible reasons:\n1. the team is unbalanced after Kroos departure and the injuries, without proper signings\n2. the team is exhausted\n3. the team has no motivation after winning big last season\n4. too many players out of their natural position\n\nYes; 1, 3, and 4 are mostly the manager's fault. We know Ancelotti is stubborn, he has an idea and won't change it, especially mid-game. That's why he doesn't make subs until we're behind and why he has the team playing low block the first half, slowing down the game. But it has worked for him, so he won't change his ways.\n\nHe's totally able to change the tactical scheme, but he rarely does it during the game. He studies the rivals and makes mistakes, but this season those mistakes outweigh the good choices.\n\nThis is probably the end of his cycle, we might get Xabi Alonso, whose style is more direct and fast-paced, but that's doesn't mean he's just a grandpa Florentino P\u00e9rez hired so he is told who you play, that's simply not true. His colleagues and former players can attest to that.",

We were comprehensively outplayed in every single match, apart from the 2nd leg against Bayern. Fucking RB Leipzig could have scored 8 goals against us if it wasn't for Sesko shooting like a donkey and Lunin turning into god. If Leipzig knocked us out in the RO16, all of a sudden last season looks a lot worse.\n\nNo wonder we're struggling this season. Last year we had Kroos playing like he's 20 years younger, Bellingham having one of the greatest debut seasons ever, and Vinicius putting up Ballon D'or performances, and yet we still played fugazi football most of the time, especially against big teams. The issue isn't the individual players (apart from Vasquez and Tchouameni), it's Ancelotti's non-existent tactics and an unbalanced squad ",

We still have the entirety of the jan transfer window.. can still sign a defender and heck trust our own academy players for once.. i dont recognise my club anymore dawg..",
