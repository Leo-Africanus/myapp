        "content": "99.9% of everyone had written Chelsea off in the final. But if anything has become clear, its that the modern game, for better or worse, requires pressing and physicallity. \n\nLook at what Chelsea did. They pressed from minute 1, the commentators were questioning if they'd run out of gas before 20 minutes and they kept on pressing. \n\nIt worked wonders. PSG, who is the best tiki taki team right now, couldnt even get a pass together. The CBs, MFs and fowards were immeadeatly stifled. They looked like PSG made Madrid look in the previous match.  It shut PSG down completely. They immediately started going to the long ball with no success.  \n\nAnd it paid off. They ran ruckus on the CB/wing backs, thanks also to Sanchez's superb passing and scored on quick turnovers in dangerous positions. They made PSG seem completely normal, average.\n\nWhile watching it, I said, thats completely the opposite of Mbappe and Vini, who barely press. The better or worse part is though, I dont like it. This isnt basketball, this is football. I miss real wings, real number 10s, beatiful dribbling and amazing passes, but alas 2025, and the press rules. If our forwards don't do it, this generation will be wasted.\n\nThis is not a drama post, or sell this player or that player. I've been watching madrid for 30 years. Its been success after success. But, the game has changed and this team has to change with it. \n\nMarca or As was quick to write a story about how Xabi will have complete authority to play or bench whomever. That's complete BS, and everyone knows it. \n\nLuis Enrique was right. (paraphrasing) \"Attacking, you're the best, but when you're not attackeing, you're the best defender in the world, thats what a leader does.\" If Xabi can't put them in line I sure hope Dani and Fede do.

        "content": "Huijsen and \u00c1lvaro Carreras have both had a breakthrough season. Majority of football fans probably did not know how much talented these players are 2 years ago, they were able to show their worth this season. \n\nHuijsen is a master at carrying the ball, either with his pinpoint passes or with his feet. So is Carreras. \n\n[Among all fullbacks in his league](https://x.com/DataMB_/status/1943720247891997042), he has the most touches, most progressive actions, most passes completed, most forward passes completed, Most progressive passes completed, most accurate passes to final third...etc. Benfica literally played through him. \n\nI don't have this year's stats but last year he dwarfed everyone in his age bracket in [progressive actions](https://x.com/DataMB_/status/1840701634726216192) in the top 7 league. \n\nOn top of all of this, he has experience playing as a CB aswell, we could see him as an LCB in some games too. I can see him transition to a CB like Ramos too.\n\nWe should be very optimistic in regards to our backline, we have a master passer in trent on our RB, A master progressive player in Alvaro on the left and Dean in the middle.

        "content": "Hey everyone,\nIt really feels like we\u2019re finally building a complete squad: two quality players for almost every position, actual investment, and long-term planning.\n\nBut looking back\u2026 why didn\u2019t Ancelotti get this?\n\nI have nothing but respect for Carlo because the man delivered everything. And back then, every headline was, \u201cReal Madrid believe there are no players on the market with Real Madrid quality.\u201d\nWe were told over and over that there was no value, that Madrid wouldn\u2019t spend just to spend. Most of Carlo\u2019s reinforcements were free signings or very opportunistic deals.\n\nBut now under Alonso, we\u2019re actually spending. There\u2019s serious investment and a plan to finally have depth in every line.\n\nSo what changed?\n\t\u2022\tDid Ancelotti not push for signings?\n\t\u2022\tWas P\u00e9rez saving funds for the stadium and Mbapp\u00e9 saga?\n\t\u2022\tOr was Carlo just seen as a transitional figure, and this new \u201ccycle\u201d was always meant for the next manager?\n\nFeels a bit unfair in hindsight, considering what Ancelotti achieved with what he had. Curious to hear what you all think \u2014 is it timing, strategy, or just a change in mindset from the club?\n\nHala Madrid \u26aa\ud83d\udc51\n",

The whole point of this is to say that from what I've seen in this sub with the way people overact to every defeat and turn on players when they are going through a rough patch, regardless of how high of an expectation we have as a club, it clearly shows that there are plenty in this sub that would literally stop supporting the club if we ever somehow become really shit.\n\nAnd as much we might not think its possible, truth is shit happens in football and times change and we could get a president after Perez that mismanages the club and then what. If half the sub loses their mind because we don't even win a preseason tournament after getting a new manager, new players and playing a new system and start losing their minds after 5 games, how will they ever handle coming 12th.",

        "content": "All the bad things happened around this game: Red card/sudden injury, if Xabi had taken control for a while he would have a plan B but it only has been 3 weeks. Valverde had to go back to RB, Camavinga. The Early mistake also ruined the game and our morale.\n\nSo I don't think it should be used to judge our squad, our players' quality, and it's not wise to buy 2-3+ players simply because of this game.\n\n\nBut yeah we need to learn from it. The whole team need to know how to press and form a balanced midfield. The 3 forward combination was terrible. \n\nI don't think Vini and Mbappe's main problem is their attitude, but they need to know how to press, how to do their job under Alonso. Especially Vini actually has very high workload but he needs to be given more instruction.",

        "content": "It\u2019s been painfully obvious that we\u2019re lacking a Kroos-type midfielder \u2014 someone who can dictate the tempo, link defense to attack, and control games with calm passing under pressure. Too often there\u2019s a void between our backline and the attackers, which also exposes us on transitions. Besides the lack of pressing and collective effort, it seems we simply miss that brain in midfield. Who\u2019s a realistic signing you\u2019d want to see? I\u2019ve seen links to Angelo Stiller from Stuttgart. Do you think he fits what we need, or should we be looking elsewhere? Curious to hear who you all think could genuinely take up some of Kroos\u2019 role.",
