        "content": "Yeahyeah everyone is probably tired of the talk but i want to put my two cents in. This isnt a vini or mbappe problem either is a play style problem. There is no identity in the club. We arent a creative team and arent a counter attacking team. Yeah we counter well but thats just when the opportunity opens itself up. \n\nThere is no fluidity in the team. We hold the ball and dont do anything will it. There is no triangle passing in the team. The off ball movements are terrible. Everyone passes and stands there after, noone passes and moves to  get open for another ball. Only pass side to side in the back and try to take it up a wing and it is just bad play. \n\nVini and mbappe have been shit at dribbling and pass recently. Mbappe scores goals but dude has trouble making a simple pass and he has been getting stopped on more dribbles than not. \n\nIm glad trent is back because i think he will be a massive boost to the squad with how he passes. \n\nWith all that said 7 wins in a row playing ugly ball is impressive and can definitely win the league this year",

I was mostly watching casually till 2017/18 but I always supported Barca. I saw least years of Messi's Barca journey and some games before then. So I was too young to able to see Figo play. I know he was our captain when he left and I'm wondering how good he was. Was he better at Barca or Madrid. Did he meet expectations and do yall consider him a Madrid legend? \nTy for reading and your answers.",

        "title": "So this sub is going after Mbappe?",
        "content": "Look at this sub page over the past 24 hours or so. It\u2019s littered with a bunch of videos going directly after Mbappe. I don\u2019t think you have to be a genius to realize why that is. Are Vini FC fans really this insecure that they have to relentlessly target Mbappe when Vini doesn\u2019t play a single match? In all seriousness, how many times do we have to have this nonsense Player FC chat on here? Why so many people on here continue to attempt to individualize collective team problems to a single individual is mind boggling. \n\nBigger picture, the back line in front of Courtois has been a shambles for several seasons between injuries, aging players, new inexperienced players, and not enough synergy between any one unit. In front of them, Perez never replaced Kroos and Modric with tempo setting midfielders who genuinely control and dictate matches. Too many of the current midfielders are athletic and able to cover lots of ground. But are not the technicians of Kroos and Modric levels who know when to speed games up, slow things down, and keep things ticking. \n\nUp top, Mbappe, Vini, and Rodrygo all prefer to operate from the LW area. We all know that. Of the three, yes, Mbappe is the most effective attacking wise operating from the left side space. You only have to look at his career numbers to very quickly realize Vini and Rodrygo are nowhere close to Mbappe\u2019s output. And I\u2019m also talking about operating from wide areas as well as a winger. Personally, I think Mbappe operates best from a floating role going across the front lines. With Garcia playing ahead of him as the striker. As for Vini, his one real move of kicking it past the defender and trying to beat them for pace has been found out. Vini visibily looks slower than several years ago and his separation pace looks diminished. You only have to go back and look at highlights from several years ago and compare him to now to see that it\u2019s quite obvious. And he never allows the LB to get forward to work with him. As for Rodrygo, he very likely wants out but knows Madrid is as good as it gets for him. We will never see the best of him playing from the RW. Which is a shame because he\u2019s a very good player.

Almost as if they would rather see the player they like succeed or the player they hate fail, over seeing the club be successful. Has it always been like this?\n\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s not unique to Madrid and that it may just be a small, vocal contingent of fans that are like this but it feels like it more so than other clubs.\n\nEdit: Mbappe, Vini, Arda, and Jude Bellingham seem to have the most and loudest fans.

        "content": "So here\u2019s my rant since that seems to be what everyone else is doing on this channel recently. I recently made a list of players that I would like to see leave the club permanently via sold or let go. i\u2019ve I had a few people respond, saying that I wasn\u2019t letting enough of the core starters go and thus nothing would change by just selling \u201cbench fodder\u201d. Where are I disagree about this most is we clearly need a mass exodus and rebuild at the club. Secondly, this squad is still a top 10 talented squad in the world. However, it is massively under performing for a multitude of reasons. One of those reasons is the club culture many have said that these young players are victims of their own success. They won multiple doubles, were in ballon d\u2019Or contention lists, and got massive extensions, all under Carlos Laissez Faire style of coaching. This has created a \u201cspoiled culture\u201d. \n\nLet me know if you disagree in the comments below, but I think if we genuinely somehow sell half the bench well there goes half the culture and we can bring in new culture. New personalities. New hunger.  \n\nPersonalities that a new manager who can get the most out of. That type of hunger is infectious just as much as a group of lazy players rub off on each other too. \n\nSo yeah, I want to keep guys like Fede and Tchouameni. It\u2019s a more worth while investment to bank on them reaching a new peak then trying to find a player better than them. \n\nThe caveat to this is they can\u2019t be guaranteed starters I want to bring in competition and they either need to adapt or die. That\u2019s the Real Madrid way that I know and love.",

        "content": "Spreading the play, opening up the field, forcing the opposition to shift, this is all possible from these players with the ease and accuracy of the long ball. Beckham had a very rough season with injuries and losing motivation, but with the title race very much on and his qualities needed, he rose to the occasion training well and winning Fabio Capello's trust. with 8 matches left he had an instant impact with 4 assists, but most importantly opening up space with his dangerous passes. After tough years of the gal\u00e1cticos, he pushed on in the end and helped give Madrid a much needed title win.\n\nTrent tearing his Lcl two seasons ago and then forcing a quick recovery last season to help win the league title with Liverpool and secure a free transfer to Madrid is now needing to recover properly. He is here to stay for 6 years, so we needed to give him time to properly recover. Now with 15 la Liga matches left, I have no doubt he will be a key piece in elevating this Madrid team. Vini spreading wide, Mbappe making runs in behind, and Jude/ Valverde ready to win the second balls or attack the center of the field we will see a very different Madrid side. Just look at Liverpool from being an easy title winner to struggling to qualify for the champions league. Salah with 47 g+a, now completely disconnected with no service in dangerous space with only 9 g+a.\n\nTrent getting that well needed recovery and will be key now in the later stages of the season.",
