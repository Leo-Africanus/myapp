They are surprised by the whistles, but were they surprised when they forced a generational coach like Xabi Alonso out?\n\nPeople love to call international fans \"glory hunters,\" but I\u2019m here in Asia region waking up at 2:00 AM every single week to watch this mess. I don\u2019t watch for the \"glory\" of the past, I watch because I love this club. But right now, the club doesn\u2019t feel like it loves the fans back.\n\nHere is the reality the board needs to hear:\n\n\u2022 No Player is Above the Club: We watched a group of players create a mess, undermine a world-class coach, and ultimately get him sacked. Instead of holding the players accountable, the board backed them and is now trying to \"discipline\" the fans for reacting.\n\n\u2022 The \"Whistle\" is our Voice: If the board thinks they can use security cameras to monitor the Grada and stop the booing, they\u2019ve lost the plot. The Bernab\u00e9u whistles because we demand excellence. If you don't want to be whistled, show the effort on the pitch.\n\n\u2022 We are willing to suffer, but not like this: Every club has bad seasons. We can handle losing if the team fights. What we can\u2019t handle is a board that protects \"untouchable\" stars while threatening the fans who actually pay (and wake up at 2 AM) to support them.\n\nStop being \"disappointed\" in the stands and start being disappointed in the locker room. The badge comes first. Always.",

        "content": "&gt;The reason Joan Laporta is Barcelona's president today is DIRECTLY THANKS to Florentino Perez! During Barcelona's elections, Florentino directly called the Sabadell Bank, as Joan Laporta needed to deposit \u20ac124.6M into Barcelona's accounts and he didn't have it. Sabadell were very reluctant at first, because Barca were in a financial crisis and couldn't guarantee payment, but it was Florentino Perez that kept insisting so much that the bank ended up approving the payment. The reason Florentino did this is because he considered Laporta a Super League ally at the time, however, Barcelona have now left the Super League.\n\n&gt;Joan Laporta pushed for a change to Sports Laws in 2022. Spanish law used to say that boards in football clubs needed to deposit 15% of the club's budget in cash. Laporta was worried that he would start losing his own money and properties because of this law, so he asked for the law to change. Florentino Perez saw Laporta as his Super League ally, so he backed Laporta's request and also pushed for the law to be changed in Spanish Congress. With the law changed, and Barca's team rebuilt, Barcelona then left the left Super League and negotiated a return to UEFA\n\nThis is from El Confidencial. Basically, Barca's rise from the ashes, including their last 2 league titles, are thanks to Perez. \n\nOur squad planning and on field issues are on thing, but this right here is something else. This alone is ground for termination imo. ",

        "content": "I can't fathom why Jude is getting so much shit from fans over Xabi's sacking, even after [the statement](https://www.reddit.com/r/realmadrid/comments/1qbzwlz/jude_bellingham_calling_out_reports_that_he_had/) he put out. Valverde &amp; Vini had both made their feelings clear (to varying degrees) whilst Bellingham remained professional throughout. We have seen nothing negative, he's played where asked without complaint &amp; spoken highly of Xabi repeatedly. But the athletic said otherwise (without actually stating what Jude's issue was exactly) so that holds more weight? \n\nFor some reason fans have sided with the media over a player who has repeatedly expressed his love for &amp; shown respect to the club, whilst consistently working hard on the pitch. Even when he has an average game you can still see the effort he makes, how he gets frustrated with himself. For him to be booed like that over other players all because of 'reports' is fucked up. I can see how Vini made a rod for his back but Jude didn't.   \n  \nBe fickle in your support all you want but at least know the facts. Here are a few things Jude has said about Xabi:  \n\"*I\u2019m still learning and I want to be better everyday, I still want to know more tactically about the game and he gives me a great chance of doing that with his knowledge of the game*\".   \n  \n\"*It's a good win, still not perfect, but the coaches' ideas are amazing, and we want to keep going.*\"   \n  \n\"*The manager's been great, I've personally got a great relationship with him, a lot of the lads do as well*\".  \n  \nOn his youtube (via his app) he said the opinion of the coach matters most to him (after teammates &amp; fans).  \n  \nOn RMTV's piece for his 100th game he said \"*It's different because every game I feel fortunate to be able to tactically analyze how I've played.*\" **He said this long before there was any talk of players not wanting to do video analysis.**  \n  \nBoth Xabi &amp; Jude said they talked everyday. In one of Xabi's press conferences he implied he had helped Jude with personal stuff (this was around the time there was news of his parents splitting &amp; the england noise), Jude also acknowledged that the season under Xabi was far from a disaster in the press conference he did for the super cup.   \n  \nI know people will trot out the usual 'PR' jab, but compare his words to how others spoke, a lot of what he said he didn't need to when you look at the full quotes. I think Jude made himself clear if you have the ability to comprehend.  \n   \nIn November in a press conference Xabi said \"*I have very good communication with Jude, a very good relationship. He's a lad who is already a world class player. but he has that hunger to improve, that desire to learn, to become more efficient with the huge potential he has. I love those kinds of players who have that curiosity &amp; take the initiative to come and ask \"what can we do better?*\" Does that sound like Jude was dismissive?  \n  \nI know posting this here is probably pissing in the wind but it needed to be said. Until something real comes out that proves otherwise I'll choose to believe Bellingham over the media &amp; bots.",
