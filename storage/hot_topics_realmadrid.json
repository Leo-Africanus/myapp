Whether it was the manager that was completely to blame, whether it was the board or the players, that fact cannot be ignored. \n\nNow, personally, I was more Carlo out than in. I was fully aware of our board full of money hoarders, to the point where it feels our players\u2019 health has been negatively compromised by it, but there is no denying the lack of football identity from this team. You can say all you want about him not getting the pieces he wanted. That does not excuse what we\u2019ve been watching on the pitch for the past year. You can say it\u2019s the players, but it\u2019s literally been individual brilliance that has been bailing us out time and time again. If it\u2019s one or two players playing like headless chickens, sure. But when the whole team often looks like they don\u2019t even train together, there is really only one finger to point.\n\nI am more than grateful for Carlo. What he and the squad managed to do last season, achieving the double with only 1 loss, all while having key players like Courtois and Militao out was nothing short of exceptional. But the time has come. There is no need for us to get caught up in our sentimentality and act like he was never the issue (or at least part of it)\n\nEverything that\u2019s happening now is for the greater good.",

This is the key missing piece that has led to our horrendous season this year. It allows our fullbacks and midfielders to have less pressure defensively. There is a reason that we won 4 champions with Casemiro in that role and then 1 champions with Tchouameni there. Playing Tchouameni at center back was Carlo's mistake for he \"solved\" a problem which then opened up a bigger problem. Our attack became disconnected from our back line and we recovered less balls. Bellingham and Valverde were constantly scrambling to cover the fullbacks which left the middle of the field exposed forcing our centerbacks to press and get cooked. And when they cover the middle, our centerbacks are forced to support the fullbacks and they get cooked. \n\nWe win more duels up the field when Tchouam\u00e9ni is there. Just throw any random center back there and let Tchouameni cook. ",

        "content": "A lot of YT videos going around about how Xabi could use his Leverkusen tactics at Real Madrid. 3 at the back, one offensive wingback, one defensive wingback, 2 pivots, 2 #10 and a #9:\n\n           ST\n        LAM   RAM\n    LWB           RWB\n         LCM  RCM\n       CB  CB  CB\n\nHow would you lineup our players into this formation?\n\nMy biggest concern regarding this setup is Vini. There are really 2 options:\n\na) LAM: everyone is putting him into this role. I think Vini performs exponentially worse the further he is from the touchline. In the center of the pitch, he has bad vision, bad first touch and makes a lot of wrong passes.\n\nb) LWB: no body mentioned this option because he would need to defend. But look at Frimpong's (RWB at Leverkusen) heatmap at one match:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zp79yr3cutze1.png?width=637&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=104371cbdee5ccc47b17bda388a036121cac038b\n\nThat's something where i can see Vini excel! Especially if left with a lot of 1v1 situations.\n\nI can imagine something like:\n\n         Mbappe\n       Jude   Arda\n    Vini           Trent\n         Cama  Fede\n     Rudi  ???  Asencio\n\noverloading the right side with Trent, Arda, Jude, Mbappe and even Fede/Cama/Tchou, then Trent sending a diagonal to the isolated Vini on the left.",

        "title": "Sergio Ramo's 92:48 equalizer is by far the most important in our club's history...",
        "content": "After watching Barcelona\u2019s second leg against Inter Milan, I\u2019ve started to think that even us Real Madrid fans, don\u2019t fully grasp just how unbelievable it is to have won 15 Champions League titles. This Barcelona team looked capable of beating anyone in the world, pulling off comebacks after comebacks. Yet, they didn\u2019t win it. Because in the end it all comes down to mentality- something they\u2019ve lacked for most of the past decade.\n\nWe won the Champions League in 2002 with a superb team featuring Raul, Zidane, Makelele, Figo, Hierro, and Roberto Carlos. After that, we signed even more global superstars like Ronaldo Nazario, David Beckham etc, only to face repeated humiliation in the Champions League. Were we not good enough? No, we simply lacked that X-factor.\n\nBy 2012, we had a phenomenal team under Mourinho that managed to stop one of the best Barcelona sides in history from winning La Liga. But we still bottled the semifinals against Bayern Munich, a tie we absolutely should have won. Ig it was just destiny at the end.\n\nThen came 2014. We reached the final against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. They took the lead around the 30th minute and defended with everything they had for the rest of the game. We created plenty of chances, many of which should have been finished, but we failed to convert them. By the 85th minute, I had given up hope. Most of us had. After a decade of coming up short in these kinds of moments, it felt all too familiar. But then came that iconic Ramos header in stoppage time, and everything changed. For the first time in what felt like forever, we came back from behind in a Champions League knockout game. From that point on, the victory felt inevitable. Atl\u00e9tico were drained, and we finished the job. But it had an ever-lasting impact on this club's legacy.\n\nSince then, we\u2019ve gone on to win five more Champions League titles. Each run has been filled with close matches and incredible comebacks. Whether you call it luck or the X-factor, there\u2019s something unique about this club. We simply don\u2019t give up.\n\nAnother reason for our success is our adaptability. Against Manchester City in both 2022 and 2024, we defended with everything we had. A lot of big clubs wouldn\u2019t do that, out of pride or because they\u2019re married to a particular style. We aren\u2019t tied down by ideology. Look at Barcelona. After taking the lead against Inter, they kept trying to score again instead of wasting time and locking the game down because they didn\u2019t want to go against their principles. That stupid decision cost them a place in the Champions League final.\n\nMoreover, since 2014, nearly every major club has suffered heartbreak in the Champions League. Every single one\u2014except Real Madrid. And in the end, it all comes down to that one Ramos header.",

        "content": "Xabi is here, and I am very excited. However, we still have a lot of holes, and I think it is naive that our roster as is fine. We have massive holes in the defense, and the midfield. \n\n  \nThe first issue is 3ATB, or 4 back? With Trent now too, I am more convinced we will not be playing 3ATB with Xabi. Either way has issues however. Would Flo let us play 3ATB? \n\n  \nDefense \n\n* 3ATB -- Rudiger, Militao, Asencio + Alaba off the bench, this is a pretty decent back 3, but the injury concerns are very real, as well as depth. \n* 4Back - Rudiger + Militao, with Trent at RB. What happens to Carvajal, and LB will still likely be a disaster. Which I don't think they address this off-season\n* Especially if they get Huisen. Which I think we need, and would solve A LOT of issues defensively in regards to depth + quality. Could ease Militao/Rudi back (finally), Alaba would be an emergency defender at LB and CB, Asencio would be a fantastic bench option. \n* I do think 3ATB would help the LB issues as long as we sign Huisen however. \n* Then Joan Martinez -- coming off ACL. I saw him live, he was remarkable against Milan, and was way better than Asecnio in the academy. I think he can be a real player for us when Alaba or Rudiger inevitably leave in the next 2 years. \n\nMidfield \n\n* This is one of the issues I think Xabi helps solve off his tactics. We still ideally need a circulator, but I think even in a 4Back, he greatly fixes the build up issues. \n* I also think Guler will play a massive role next year, and he likely is the player they think will play that circulator roll. And I am not surprised if Xabi is very intrigued by him.\n\n  \nAttack \n\n* I not only think he should go for squad reasons, but Rodrygo should go to raise funds imo. Especially because Xabi has not played with 3 forwards much, the third attacker if he uses one is probably Jude. \n* Which would leave us with Mbappe + Vini + Endrick + Brahim + Guler (kinda) Which I think is fine. Maybe an academy player, which we might be more prone to use under Xabi than Carlo. \n\n  \nMacro Things\n\n* Is he going to get MBappe or Vini to press?\n* Is there any chance of a LB?\n* What happens to Carvajal when he comes back? \n* I actually do think if Huisen is signed we would be well to play 3ATB, but doubt it happens. I think this 3-4-1-2 would be pretty killer.  \n   * Asencio / Huisen / Rudiger (depth is a little bit of an issue, but Joan + Alaba + MIlitao playing more reserve roles is fine probably?)\n   * Guler / Tchouameni / Fede / Trent \n   * Jude \n   * Vini/Mbappe\n\n",
