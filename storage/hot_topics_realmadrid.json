        "content": "   There has been a lot of names going around to replace Kroos. The first one being Rodri, he used to be great but I don\u2019t see him as a game creator and line breaker. Not to mention his beef with the club. On the other hand we have Enzo, he is extremely expensive and has performed well already, but his price is not worth what he brings in my opinion. Great player, but he is not the best at game creation. Then we have Mac from Liverpool, who is my favorite. He has already proved himself and is also someone who can play deeper and also break lines. However, I don\u2019t think he is the best option. He is too expensive and will be tough to buy. Then we have the obvious option (imo), Stiller. Stiller is not only great at creating game, and making long passes. But he is also young and cheap. Angelo Stiller this season had stats basically identical to Kroos. Having one of the highest percentage passes and making a lot of long passes. He is cheap, young and recommended by Kroos. If you ask me I don\u2019t know why we wouldn\u2019t go for him. Who do you think is the best option?",

Rodri is now 29 and coming back from an ACL injury. I don\u2019t think it would be a smart investment.  ",

They\u2019re legends of their own, you see them all pressing, running behind the ball. You even see Cristiano at minute 75 in our area defending a corner. That\u2019s why we won 3 CL in a row. Nobody complained about anyone\u2019s work rate and they all ran. That was a team. We have some of the best players in each position at this day and age and I believe things can work out but our team has an attitude problem not necessarily lack of quality or tactics and I do think even Vini and Mbappe can play together. I hope Xabi\u2019s presence shows that he is not there to make friends but to mold a bunch of players into a team. If they all collectively put as much heart as Valverde does, we would steamroll most teams in La Liga and compete against the big ones in Europe. ",

        "title": "Courtois might actually be the best keeper we\u2019ve ever had",
        "content": "I know this might sound unpopular, but hear me out. I\u2019ve followed Real Madrid for a long time. I remember watching Iker Casillas make his debut at 18 against Athletic Bilbao. He was a legend, no doubt. Amazing reflexes, clutch saves, a symbol of the club.\n\nBut if we\u2019re being honest, Casillas had flaws too. He was shaky at times, especially on crosses and aerial balls. That\u2019s one of the reasons why he eventually lost his place to Diego L\u00f3pez around the age of 31.\n\nNow look at Courtois.\n\nSince he joined Real Madrid, he completely owned the number one spot. Nobody questioned it. Not even Keylor Navas, who had great moments and made big saves, could truly challenge him. But Keylor also had weaknesses, especially when it came to dealing with high balls and staying consistent.\n\nCourtois brings something different. He\u2019s calm, dominant in the air, and shows up in big matches. Just think about the Champions League final in Paris. That performance wasn\u2019t just good, it was historic.\n\nEven now, despite his age and the time missed due to injury, nobody is seriously thinking about replacing him. That level of trust says a lot.\n\nIn my opinion, Courtois is the most complete and consistent goalkeeper we\u2019ve had in modern Real Madrid history. Not trying to erase what Casillas did. But based on what I\u2019ve seen, Courtois is that guy.",
