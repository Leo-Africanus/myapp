        "content": "Camavinga or Arda Guler: Who will fit the Xabi project long term?\nMy take:\nIts 2016 all over again. Zidane had a tough choice to make between Casemiro and James Rodriguez. Fans wanted James, some news portals said the then attackers liked James too(more goal scoring chances for them), fans even called the Brazilian 'Cancermiro' but Zidane took a bold decision and chose  defensive stability over offensive threat. \nResult: The legendary KCM trio, one of the most successful periods in club history.\n\nThe Camavinga and Arda Guler story rings a similar bell.\nBut its different. Though James and Arda Guler are prolific #10s but Casemiro was a CDM and Camavinga is an all phase monster. \n\nArda Guler is good but out of the two only Camavinga is generational. Arda Guler is well liked by fans and Mbappe but Camavinga is not far behind, he is liked by fans and Mbappe is his compatriot. \n\nWhen the time comes, Xabi will have to make the big decision , it remains to be seen if he has the nerves of steel that Zidane had. I wish the decision comes sooner rather than later.\n\nTell me your thoughts.",

        "content": "The common opinion on this sub is that Arda needs to play the 10 so that he can create chances for Mbappe. What I am not understanding however is Kroos did not play as a CAM and still created many chances for Madrid and was a key piece of our midfield. I feel like it would make more sense for the 10 to also have the threat of scoring, something that Jude has but Arda really does not. I think a lot of the characterizations of Arda (I love him and he deserves the praise) comes from some early dominance in the season when were playing teams that are really not that competitive. A bunch of those goals come from Mbappe's ability to develop plays considering of course that was what he was used to as a left winger. If Arda is truly that creative would we not see him succeed in the position he currently is in? Honestly I would ideally love to have Bellingham play further up (maybe 9), whoever is best fit in left wing between Mbappe and Vini, Mastantuono right wing, and Arda as 10. I have very limited knowledge so let me know what you guys think :)\n\nAlso please guys I love Arda, and I love the club. Im just trying to have a discussion, sometimes its scary to post here lmao.",

        "content": "COMUNICADO OFICIAL: \n\nReal Madrid C. F. expresses its satisfaction with today's Supreme Court ruling, which once again finds in favour of our club against LaLiga. \n\nThis ruling fully confirms the arguments put forth by Real Madrid against the illegal statutory amendment promoted by LaLiga in 2015. This illegal amendment altered the distribution of the clubs' audiovisual rights. \n\nThe Supreme Court has declared null and void the Second Additional Provision of LaLiga's Statutes, incorporated in 2015 without legal authorisation and aimed at altering the distribution of audiovisual revenues for the 2015-2016 season outside the scope of the law.  \n\n\nAs a result of this nullity, the valid distribution for that season must be that established by the Statutes at the time: \n\n\\* 60% of the revenue for First Division clubs. \n\n\\* 40% for Second Division clubs. \n\n\\* Equal distribution among all clubs within each category. \n\nTherefore, the applicable legal distribution entails the payment of approximately 88 million euros in additional funds, which were illegally withheld, to the clubs that played in the Second Division in the 2015-2016 season: Alav\u00e9s, Albacete, Alcorc\u00f3n, Almer\u00eda, Bilbao Athletic, C\u00f3rdoba, Elche, Gimn\u00e0stic de Tarragona, Girona, Huesca, Legan\u00e9s, Llagostera, Lugo, Mallorca, Mirand\u00e9s, Numancia, Osasuna, Ponferradina, Real Oviedo, Tenerife, Real Valladolid and Real Zaragoza.  \nIt also means that Real Madrid will receive the amount it was legally entitled to, some 8.8 million euros, of which it was also unlawfully deprived. \n\nThis ruling by the Supreme Court restores legality and ensures that decisions affecting Spanish professional football are always taken with full respect for the law and transparency.  \nThe Supreme Court's ruling completely dismisses the appeal filed by LaLiga and ratifies in full the ruling already made in favour of Real Madrid by the National High Court. \n\nThis ruling is of fundamental importance for the economic interests of the clubs that were then playing in the Second Division and for Real Madrid itself. \n\nWith this ruling, the Supreme Court confirms that Real Madrid and the aforementioned clubs were unlawfully damaged by LaLiga's actions.

I think he is more of a deep, intelligent midfielder with composure on the ball, very positionally aware, and strong in build-up phases.\n\nIf Madrid actually went for him:\n\n* **Where would he realistically play?** Is he someone you see rotating with Tchouam\u00e9ni as a 6, or more like a Kroos-style left-sided pivot? Could he function as a double-pivot in certain matches?\n* **How would he be used tactically under our current system?** More of a possession controller? Press-resistant recycling guy? Or someone who could unlock play with vertical passes?\n* **Do we think he\u2019d get minutes right away or be a \u201cslow integration\u201d type of signing?** There\u2019s already a crowded midfield, so is this more of a depth/future-planning move or something that would actually change line-ups?\n\nI want to hear from people who watch him regularly like what\u2019s his ceiling, and does he actually make sense for us going forward?\n\nCurious to hear thoughts from the community.",

Alexis Mac Allister described Trent AA as the best passer he has ever seen. The Elche draw was secured due to his set pieces. How do you think Xabi tackles this issue? Should we use Mastantuano again in the lineup on the right side and he also took set piece duty for River Plate, so he could be handy. Or do you think we should trust Rodrygo again for the starting role?",

        "content": "Given Carvajal and Trent are out I think this would be a great time to move to this formation specially now that we have Militao and Rudiger back. Play them both back with Asencio. Carreras as a LM and Valverde as RM because we know they can handle covering goal to goal. Tchouameni as CDM to further reinforce the midfield and defense. Guler and Bellingham as CM or even both CAMs if we are dominating possession. Vini and Mbappe up top, me personally I would shock everyone and put Mbappe as LW and start Brahim or Gonzalo as RW. ",
