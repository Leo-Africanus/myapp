Like every year, I try to recreate the kit design as accurately as possible \u2014 and this season, I\u2019m stuck on one detail.\n\nThe jersey has a subtle circular pattern in the fabric, and I\u2019m having trouble figuring out the exact layout (spacing, size, and alignment). I\u2019ve checked a lot of photos and tried recreating it, but it still feels slightly off.\n\nHere\u2019s the best version I\u2019ve been able to make so far (attached image).\nIf anyone has close-up shots or insights on how the pattern is structured, I\u2019d really appreciate the help.\n\nThanks in advance!\n",
