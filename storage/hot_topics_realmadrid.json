You can blame Carlo if you have proof that they did advise the player not to play but Carlo didn't listen.\n\nDo you understand how insane some of you sound? His job is \"Manager\", not \"Doctor\".",

He has missed several great chances by choosing not to use his weaker foot, instead attempting to reposition his body to shoot with his stronger right foot. This often results in losing the ball or wasting valuable opportunities. I initially believed he was confident with his weaker foot, but it seems I was mistaken.\n\n",
