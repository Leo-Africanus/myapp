It was obvious that Carreras was expecting to join us before the tournament started and it didn\u2019t sit well with him at all because the first two games he played, you can clearly see that he didn\u2019t want to play for them anymore. I can understand why would back out last minute because he\u2019s one of their best players this season and you wouldn\u2019t want to go in to a tournament without your best guys. What confuses me, is the fact he didn\u2019t play a single minute today knowing that this was a must win match and you need your best starting eleven. This just seems like pettiness me honestly; and if that\u2019s the case why didn\u2019t you let him come to us in the first place. What do you guys think",

But one of them just played a full season at Real Madrid and earned Brazil call-ups. The other is back in Brazil struggling to find form.\n\nStats don\u2019t tell the whole story but they do help.

Against Juve, if Xabi places him, it must be a few minutes, he is returning from an operation... \nAnd we have to take care of this man, he is a great player, it is my humble opinion. ",

The only thing that worries me is that we haven't truly been tested by a formidable opposition side so I'm wondering how we would actually fare against powerhouses especially with minimal adjustment time.",

        "content": "With Gonzalo Garc\u00eda emerging and looking like a well-suited supersub 9 for us, where do you all see the future of Endrick going?\n\nAt this very moment, Endrick would be the 3rd in line if we attack with a 3-5-2 (Vini+Mbappe -&gt; Rodrygo -&gt; Garcia/Endrick), and in a 4-3-3 attack he would be maybe even further down that list at 4th choice.\n\n  \nIt's hard for me to see Endrick getting more than 1.000-1.200 minutes next season, where most of those will be in CdR or coming on in the 80th minute. I feel like we spent 50m\u00a3 on one of the most promising players, and then never gave him a shot. Which is only natural right, we have such a stacked team.\n\n  \nShouldnt we loan him out or sell him with a buy-back clause like Nico Paz?",
