I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s physically ready for a full match, but I\u2019d love to see him get more time\u2014maybe in the second half? Before his injury, I genuinely thought he was bringing some much-needed creativity and composure in midfield, especially helping with ball progression from the back. Curious what you all think\u2014too soon, or could this be the perfect moment to ease him back in?",
