But if even life comes to an end, imagine what it's like when a period with a football team comes to an end.\n\n\"I've enjoyed it, and I want to finish it well. And then, on the 26th, I'll talk about another challenge.\"\n\nThe fact Real have yet to officially announce Ancelotti's departure was raised by reporters but he played it down and said everything was done in accordance with all the parts involved.\n\n\"Real will issue a statement when they think adequate, but there is no problem or issue between all parts whatsoever,\" Ancelotti said.\n\"I never had problems with Real and never will have problems with Real. It's a club that lives dearly in my heart, but everything in life has a date to end.\"\n\n\"I am very fond of (Alonso). I don't have any advice for him because he has all the tools to be a great coach in the future,\" Ancelotti said of a player he coached at Real during his first spell in charge.\n\n\"The day I arrived, if someone had told me I would win 11 titles in four years, I would have signed (for) it in blood. This season hasn't gone well for many reasons. But it has been an unforgettable period.\n\n\"I couldn't be Madrid coach for the rest of my life. It comes to an end for many reasons. The club may need a new impetus. I'm not making a big deal out of it.\n\"A thousand thanks to this club. And we'll carry on. I'll always be a Madrid fan. It's the end of an era. Spectacular.

How much should be the salary of Mbappe Vini Bellingham and Fede ?",
