        "title": "About Vinicius taking penalties.",
        "content": "This here is one of the reasons why we would probably take two steps forward as a team and 1 step back. Indiscipline. We saw it under Carlo and we are seeing it again. \n\nThis is a footage of Vini just picking up the ball and going for the penalty, He did not ask Mbappe for the penalty. Mbappe is a non confrontational person, and despite being on a hattrick, he let Vini take it. \n\nVini\u2019s penalties even when he scores are terrible, he hits them without any form of technique. Anyone can miss a pen, but some penalties are genuinely bad. If this penalty gimmick continues, it will cost us one day. \n\nThe decision to take the penalty was against the clear instructions of the coach who has made it clear time and time again who the primary taker is. There is no team that makes progress with rebellion and indiscipline.  \n\nThere is still signs of indiscipline in this team and it is obvious where it stems from. \n\nXabi should either put his foot down on many things or the same bad attitude which plagued this team under Carlo Ancelotti will keep repeating itself. It doesn\u2019t matter how many penalties Bayern Munich have and it doesn\u2019t matter how many penalties Kane misses, he continues to take them. This is a clear case of hierarchy and structure.  \n\nFinally, Mbappe is a leader in every sense of the word, his leadership has mostly come from his performances on the pitch and rightly so. His gestures towards teammates have always been with harmonious intentions, but he has to also understand that maintaining harmony cannot happen by contradicting the instructions of the coach who again made it clear in the post match press conference that the designated pk taker is the designated pk taker. \n",

        "content": "This one dribble by Endrick is better than anything Franco Mastantuono has shown us this game. With how short Endrick is, and with how good Mbapp\u00e9 is, I think RW is the perfect position for Endrick. Before he goes away on loan, I would love for Xabi to try Endrick at RW rather than at ST.\n\nI like Franco's energy, but he constantly loses the ball, he can't dribble, and he doesn't score goals. Yes, he brings good energy and helps in defense, but that's all. I think that Endrick has more to bring than Franco for now. If it were up to me, I would give Endrick more playing time as an RW than he's being given now.\n\nI'm not saying that Franco should be benched, but how is it fair that Franco gets so much playing time when he's not really delivering all that much? Franco has already had, in the 3 months he's been at the club, more playing time than Endrick has had since he joined Real Madrid 15 months ago. Endrick has scored 7 goals, and Franco just 1. Surely, I'm not the only one who has been thinking about this. **Play Endrick at RW, not at ST.**",

I hope that Xabi keeps it that way, since that is where Valverde shines. This gives space for more players to play in the midfield. Against Valencia, I think we saw our best formation yet. Playing Valverde at right back gives us not only a strong defender, but also someone who has been showing he can pass too. Trent should probably become Valverde\u2019s backup or be played in midfield but I doubt he will play there. ",
