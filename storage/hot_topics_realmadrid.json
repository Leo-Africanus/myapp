        "content": "I think the distances covered in this game might be one of the best stats to show our season in a nutshell.\n\nTop 4 performers from Arsenal and 1km less on average. Our players are spent.\n\nIt has been discussed plenty of times how unlucky we are with injuries. 2 regular starters missing from the defence (Dani and Eder) and most midfielders struggled with at least one significant injury (min. 1 month) throughout the season.\n\nIt has also been mentioned how our squad has caveats. No backup RB. 2 CBs at the start of the season (Rudi is 1 and Eder and Alaba I count as half each since they had major injuries). We got lucky with Asencio, his integration was not a result of precise planning but rather necessity. No proper alternate FW.\n\nThen the misallocation of minutes. Obviously we don\u2019t see how the players work in trainings so let\u2019s trust Carlo\u2019s and his team\u2019s judgment on the players performance and deserved minutes. But I cannot fathom that for them the only two options for the fringe players are less than 5 mins or 90 mins every 1,5 months. There were several games where some of them could have started. There were other games where they could have been substituted earlier.\n\nAnd now Jude and Fede are running on their last reserves. Rudiger is a colossus but I think even he might start to feel fatigued and some cracks start to show up in his performance. Asencio is great but not experienced enough. Tchoumani is our best player right now. Luka is unfortunately not fit anymore to deliver every 3 days. Camavinga for one 8+ performance has 2 underwhelming ones. Vini-problem no need to be elaborated anymore.\n\nI\u2019m being too pessimistic and just had to vent a little?",

        "content": "Let me start by saying that Ancelotti is responsible of what is going on, as a coach. He is NOT innocent and deserves all criticism, as things barely improved since the beginning of the season.\n\nIt's fine if you're a supporter and you want change because you see things are not working for your team. Nothing wrong with being mad at your team losing like this in the favorite competition.\n\nWith that being said, the brain dead takes of 'Bring in Raul/Zidane/X for the second leg and the rest of the season' is just un-fucking-believable. This is not Lopetegui or Rafael Benitez. This is Carlo Ancelotti, the coach with the most titles and who won us 3 UCLs ! Doesn't he deserve to finish the season ? If he doesn't, who does ? And you all counter Bar\u00e7a posts about Real Madrid disrespecting their legends !!!\n\nAnd none of these motherfuckers watched a game managed by Raul in Castilla. It was the same cries last year and the year before and the year before, since Carlo took charge. Don't tell me this is because of his performance this season.. even when he performed, I still see the shit he takes, and people wanted Tuchel to replace him back in the day !\n\nWe have lots of problems, including players mentality and squad depth and injury crisis. But y'all love summing everything into 'Carlo is garbage fuck off bring in Xabi/Klopp/Zizou'...  because you want results right away and can't take a loss and want a scapegoat and an easy roast. You think managing an institute and a club like Real Madrid by switching legend coaches with 10 matches or 15 matches left in the season is the way to go...\n\nI will not change reality with this, as I believe those stupid cunts exist in every 'popular' club. I remember Bar\u00e7a fans posting a 'Hansi Flick is not right for us' upvoted post when Benefica was winning against them in that 5-4 remontada. This is where a club like freaking Atletico Madrid is even more respectful towards Simeone... and even Man City out there, who is supposed to have 'glory hunters' is defending Guardiola despite the shit performance.\n\nI ain't asking to defend Ancelotti. Ancelotti is NOT a failure of a coach, but now he is failing. We won, made crazy come backs, celebrated UCL wins like nothing under this coach... the least I can do is NOT disrespect him and let him have what it looks like it's his final season and even if my brain doesn't believe in a come back, my heart does. He has given a lot.\n\nI'm no Ancelotti nut eater, I'm a man who has been watching Real Madrid since 2011 and lived his most joyful moments under Ancelotti and during our worst moments, I understand the old man is human and prone to mistakes and not just some idiot sitting in his room playing FIFA and thinking of players as PS5 bots and acting like they understand 'tactics', like a lot of people.\n\nNothing wrong with 'We need a new coach' and 'Ancelotti did a lot but his time is up'... but seriously any 'Ancelotti has been a lucky bastard carried by individual brilliance' or 'Ancelotti is stupid, bring in Raul or Zizou' for the second leg, GTFO",

Mbappe basically was an obsession for Perez &amp; he was a financial signing. Madrid needed a real striker for these big games.\n\nConceded 9 against Barca, 3 vs Milan, 4 vs Sociedad, now 3 vs Arsenal. This is a shit team with no chemistry with a manager who has no idea on strategy &amp; tactics, who wins mostly because of his player's individual brilliance. I hate barca but I love the way Hansi Flick plays and he is winning with a bunch of kids from the academy.\n\nMidfield control &amp; defensive stability is needed but I know Perez will probably bring in another attacker like Wirtz or Gy\u00f6keres. F*ck the defense I think.\n\nAncelotti is done. He should f*ck off right now. Get KLOPP ,he is the best available.",

        "content": "Today, Madrid just didn\u2019t feel like Madrid at any point. I was definitely worried going into this match  far from home, playing on Arsenal\u2019s surface, with their fans behind them, our struggling defense, no Tchouameni in midfield, and Alaba forced to play LB. To be fair, Alaba did well today, but I was absolutely not expecting a 3-0 loss. I was expecting more from our attack  they looked clueless for most of the game apart from some flashes in the first half.\n\nMbappe showed glimpses, Vini tried, Rodrygo too  the first half was going decently well. But after that absolute banger from Declan Rice in the second half, it felt like we just gave up. We were crumbling all over the pitch  clearing the ball aimlessly. For the first time in a long time, I genuinely saw real urgency and frustration written all over our players. The energy shifted completely.\n\nAnd after that second Rice free-kick, it really felt like it was done. That was the killer blow. It felt like Arsenal just finished us right there.\n\nI know we still have a second leg back home. And we are Real Madrid  the club where dreams happen, where magical things have always been possible. But are we still that Madrid this season? That\u2019s the real question weighing on my mind.\n\nCan we overcome this? With Lucas and Alaba as our main full-backs, I\u2019m genuinely worried. But at the same time, I\u2019m still hopeful  because it\u2019s the Bernab\u00e9u, and this is Real Madrid. Hopefully, we\u2019ll see a comeback for the ages.\n\nBut if I\u2019m being realistic, things aren\u2019t looking good right now. And with Bar\u00e7a coming up on the 26th too\u2026 this stretch of games is going to test us like never before.\n\nHala Madrid\u2026 always.\n\n",

        "content": "The team looks completely lost right now, and it's hard to see how things can get any better under Carlo Ancelotti. While he's been a legendary figure in football and has brought success in the past, the current situation suggests that his time might be up. Tactically, the squad looks uninspired, lacking both direction and motivation. There's no sense of urgency, no fighting spirit, and most importantly, no clear identity on the pitch. It's painful to watch a team with so much talent underperform like this.\n\nAncelotti has done what he can, and perhaps he's exhausted all his options. Sometimes, even the best managers reach a point where they can no longer connect with the players or lift the dressing room. That\u2019s what seems to be happening now. The team isn\u2019t responding, and the results reflect that. It\u2019s not about one bad game or a poor stretch of form\u2014it\u2019s the overall vibe, the energy, or lack thereof, that\u2019s most concerning.\n\nAt this point, Florentino P\u00e9rez needs to make a bold decision for the good of the club. Bringing back Zinedine Zidane for the rest of the season could be that spark. Zidane knows the club inside out, understands the players, and has a proven record of uniting and energizing the squad even in the toughest moments. He commands respect, and sometimes, that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s needed when tactics alone aren\u2019t enough.\n\nIt\u2019s not even about long-term planning anymore\u2014it\u2019s about saving what\u2019s left of this season. For the sake of the fans, the badge, and the legacy, this team needs fresh leadership immediately. As painful as it is to say, I just can\u2019t watch another match with Ancelotti at the helm. The time for change is now.\n",

And sure enough we struggled because of sooooo many reasons (injuries + no Kroos &amp; Nacho replacements + no tactics + no hunger/drive/passion/etc). \n\nFrom the get go, this season felt off! \n\nSometimes I wonder, is it because the squad has won way too many UCLs already or La Ligas that they are not as motivated? Or is it just because Ancelotti\u2019s tactics no longer work/he does not know what to do with the team now? Or the players are just bad (or in a slump)?\n\nI know, we cannot win every single time!

Sadly \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI just hope the team will finish the season strong \u2014 UCL QFs 2nd leg + remaining La Liga games + CDR.\n\nAnd hopefully, HOPEFULLY\u2026 we find solutions to our problems ASAP! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc I\u2019m sure Real Madrid will come back strong \u2014 they\u2019ve been through this before! And they have proven time and time again that they can recover.\n\nI just want to extend grace to the entire team coz if it\u2019s hard for us, it must be harder for them. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc94\n\nSo, as early as now\u2026 I\u2019m already conceding \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f. I\u2019d rather be realistic (and pessimistic) rather than setting myself up for disappointment and be heartbroken. There\u2019s nothing wrong with losing anyways, that\u2019s part of life\u2026 just as long as you don\u2019t stay a loser and that you actually strive to be better\n\n\u00a1HALA MADRID y nada mas!",

Only problem was that Arsenal bottled the midfield and made Rodrygo\u2019s width irrelevant. And when we managed to get it wide, Skelly had plenty of time to catch up. We essentially played down a man due to Ancelotti\u2019s tactical approach. 3 men down if you include Mbappe and Vini\u2019s non-existent press.\n\n[Tactical Analysis](https://youtu.be/edZESO6HSeg?si=kGvGfsHsJ2eMBE_C)",

Why doesn\u2019t Carlo play mbappe at lw endrick at st or arda/rodrygo/brahim at rw? or rodrygo lw endrick st mbappe rw (given he played there at monaco and france)? or maybe even pair up mbappe and endrick at striker? Listen, i know that vini has given a lot to this club and i truly appreciate it but if we want to win against arsenal and in general against anyone this season something needs to change. And seeing vini\u2019s performances recently i question if he deserves to start anymore. And i know mbappe is inconsistent as well but we\u2019ve all seen when he plays his natural position (Left wing) he always excels and plays great. So please if there is a fault in my question let me know and thank you.",
