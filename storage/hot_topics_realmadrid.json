        "content": "By god's grace barcelona lost the semifinal tie today to inter that too on extra time. That means they are both exhausted and down on morale (hopefully).\n\nDoes this give us a sniff at the la liga title? I mean after the kind of football we have play this season, us winning the la liga title wuld be unbelievable especially overcoming a 4 point lead in just 4 games. First of these are the remaining games of the following teams:\n\n**Real Madrid:**\n\n1) Barcelona (Currently 1st, Away) \n\n2)Mallorca (Currently 10th, Home)\n\n3) Sevilla (Currently 16th, Away)\n\n4) Real Sociedad (Currently 11th, Home)\n\n**Barcelona:**\n\n1) Real Madrid (Currently 2nd, Home)\n\n2) Espanyol (Currently 14th, Away)\n\n3) Villareal (Currently 5th, Home)\n\n4) Athletic Club (Currently 4th, Away)\n\n  \nSo first of all its fair to say that if we don't beat barcelona in the next el classico our chances are reduced to almost zero because then we wuld need to depend on barca to lose all three next games and for us to win each one of them\n\nIf the next el classico is a draw, we would have to win all three next games at all cost and hope barca to lose one game and draw one game\n\nIf we win the el classico (a very big if given our defense for the reamining of the season)... Then we will be just 1 point behind them and its very likely that barca can drops some points in their next games because with real beits improved form and them fighting for the champions league spot, athletic club and real betis will try their best to get a win vs barcelona. \n\nSadly the situation is not fully in our hands bcz we depend on barca losing points in any scenario, but still if we somehow win this la liga titles it wuld be one our greatest heist since 2021-22 champions league win",

Winning the Clasico next week would not only partially redeem us for past defeats and embarrassments from them this season, but give us something to bite on, build our charge on. If we win, we\u2019d fall 1 point behind Barca, with 4 games to go. After some of the questionable performances this team (players AND coaching staff alike) have given us, this is the time to prove themselves worthy of the badge.",

While we know we have incredible players like Rodrygo, Mbapp\u00e9, and Vini, and their talent can light up any game, overconfidence has a way of backfiring. This is something Barcelona fans have also dealt with, it even reflected in their players\u2019 comments.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t call me arrogant when I keep winning.\u201d Yet, football has proven time and again that such thinking can lead to unexpected outcomes. For example, Inter is often dismissed as \u201cjust a defensive team that sits back,\u201d but underestimating them is a dangerous mistake. The same overconfidence struck AC Milan in 2007 when they thought they were above Liverpool before the Champions League final. They were humbled in the most memorable way.\n\nFor us to maintain our consistency as a team, it\u2019s essential that our players respect the game, their opponents, and the effort required to succeed. I hope next season, they approach every match with 100% effort and avoid falling into the trap of overconfidence.\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who pointed out that Milan actually won in 2007. I was referring to the 2005 final.",

        "content": "Whenever someone makes a big mistake, many fans suggest they be sold. Brahim Diaz played one bad game against Barcelona (he didn\u2019t even play the entire 90 minutes) and people forget his contributions towards the club.\n\nHe usually plays well and Madrid wouldn\u2019t have made it past Atletico without him. Also, there were multiple reasons why Madrid lost last el clasico, including Vinicius\u2019 poor decision making, Rodrygo\u2019s off season, many injuries, and Ancelotti\u2019s tactics.\n\nEdit: Some of you guys failed to understand that I am saying that you shouldn\u2019t say to sell a player and get so angry at them after a few mistakes here and there. It\u2019s alright to say that a player is PART of the reason a team lost but to blame them entirely is another thing. I\u2019m not being a hypocrite by pointing out the failures of other players too, and I even admitted that Brahim had a bad game (it\u2019s implied that he was part of the reason Madrid lost).",
