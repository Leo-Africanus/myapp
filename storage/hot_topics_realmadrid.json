But obviously it didn't work well. After Ceballos pop up he seems to find his solution. Modric could also play the role.\n\nBut after Ceballos' injury he got only Modric to use. And he didn't trust Guler. In the first Arsenal game Modric seems to get muscled out in the 2nd half. And he tried to put Valverde in the middle again, but it didn't work. Vasquez became a weak spot again and caused the 3rd goal.\n\nThe La Liga game before the 2nd leg, Modric didn't start but he didn't start in the 2nd leg as well. I guess Carlo once again wanted to let Valverde to do the playmaker job but it failed horribly once again. We obviously lack of tempo and connection in the 1st half.\n\nI still think Carlo should have put more confidence in Guler, it's a bit too late now. ",

If any, which midfielder would you like to be signed this summer?",

It\u2019s Real Madrid!!\u201d \u201cWe are not a system team!!,\u201d and, simply put, I think they are all misguided.\n\nYes, we\u2019ve been successful, we\u2019ve won consistently, you could even say we\u2019ve dominated Europe (though some of our recent CL runs required highly improbable comebacks against better teams), but the game is still moving forward. If we don\u2019t implement a system now we will fall behind. 433/442 and vibes will cease to work consistently without a system. I think it\u2019d be best to trust Xabi and let him implement the changes and make the signings required to get us playing modern football. Not allowing this to happen would possibly be Flo\u2019s biggest mistake ",
