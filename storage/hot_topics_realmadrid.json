After that for each round we make we get even more money. Total maximum amount of money we could win is 155 million dollars and getting TAA earlier not only improves our chances of winning that money but also helps Xabi try out his tactics before the start of next season.",

        "content": "For me, without a doubt, it\u2019s the failed transfer of David de Gea in 2015.\n\nAt the time, De Gea was absolutely world-class. He was Spain\u2019s starting goalkeeper, making unreal saves every week for Manchester United, and everyone saw him as the natural successor to Iker Casillas at Real Madrid. The club had been after him for years and that summer it finally looked like it was going to happen.\n\nThe plan was for De Gea to join Madrid and Keylor Navas to go the other way to Manchester United. The two clubs had agreed, the contracts were drawn up, everything seemed ready. But on the final day of the transfer window, something went wrong. Reports said United delayed sending the documents. The paperwork was submitted late and the transfer collapsed.\n\nReal Madrid blamed United, United insisted they sent everything on time, but the Spanish league didn\u2019t accept the registration. So the deal died. Navas stayed at Madrid, took his chance, and ended up becoming a key part of the team that won three straight Champions League titles. As for De Gea, he stayed at United, but it felt like that missed move broke something. He was never quite the same again. Still solid at times, but that aura he had was gone.\n\nEven Casillas, I remember, had spoken positively about De Gea, saying he\u2019d be welcomed at Madrid.\n\nIt\u2019s one of those \u201cwhat ifs\u201d that really stuck with me. It felt inevitable and then it just didn\u2019t happen.\n\n\nThank god we had the opportunity to have courtois.\ud83e\udd0d\n\nWhat about you? Is there a Real Madrid transfer that almost happened and left a mark on you? Something that still comes to mind when you think of what could have been?",
