I have read that tickets for games that are not el clasico, Madrid derby etc you can usually get at the stadium the day of. Is that a true statement still? I have seen tickets for sale on sites like StubHub or viagogo, are those sold by season ticket holders? Because I know the tickets don\u2019t usually go on sale until the week of, unless you get the hospitality tickets. I see tickets for around $300 to sit in the middle of the stadium which is what I would be interested in, but is that a fair price to pay? Or should I rather wait until I\u2019m there?\n\nIf anyone has went to a game last season, any input would be appreciated. ",

I don't think another season of mediocre results due to not having the players the manager wants is acceptable for a team like ours. \n\nLook at Liverpool, despite winning the league. They reinforced their squad and it seems they are gonna sign Isak aswell, a player that would be perfect for our club. \n\nimo, it would be a crazy achievement from Xabi if we manage to have an amazing season and I hope that the fans and the board don't blame Xabi cuz he doesnt have the players he wants for the footbal he wants to play.",

        "content": "It felt like the guy could see space anywhere and just pass it eaisly and his vision was amazing but boy was the dude lazy he barely ever ran and mostly walked and it seemed he lacked physicality.\n\nThe dude at one point was getting assists at a ridiculous number I would go as far as to say this guy never actually reached his full potential and if he played in a different decade lets say 1990-2010 he would be considered in the top 10 best midfielder of all-time argument as Cams basically died during his time",
