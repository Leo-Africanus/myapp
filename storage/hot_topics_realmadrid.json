Personally,  I am not thrilled with this, as I do not feel the need to have another superstar among the likes of Kylian, Jude, Vini, Rodrygo, and Trent. I would rather prefer a low profile signing (cost and fame wise) like Stiller, and then build using the talent we already have. \n\nI also feel that the arrival of another superstar would reduce the opportunities Arda would get, as I seriously believe in his talent as a player and to his commitment for Real Madrid.\n\nBetween Wirtz and Enzo, I think it would be Wirtz due to Xabi's preference. Plus I do not want Enzo Fernandez because of him being a racist mf. What do you guys think of Wirtz in the Real Madrid setup. Keeping aside the money, will he do wonders in the midfield with Jude and Valverde?",

But I couldn\u2019t find much content from our side \u2014 how we as Real Madrid fans reacted when he joined.\n\nI know Figo later proved himself and became a key part of the Gal\u00e1cticos, earning the love and respect of our fanbase. But I\u2019m curious \u2014 was he warmly welcomed from day one, or were there doubts and hate like what we saw with Mbapp\u00e9 recently (even though Mbapp\u00e9 didn\u2019t do anything close to what Figo did to Bar\u00e7a)?\n\nTo be honest, if someone like Rodri ever joined Madrid, I\u2019d struggle to accept it considering how he treated Vini. So I really wonder how Figo managed to win people over, and what the initial reaction was like when he first arrived.\n\nWould love to hear from older fans who remember that time or anyone who has insights!\n",
