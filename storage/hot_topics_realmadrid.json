Instead, the coaching staff and management decided to fly the entire squad to Palm Beach, Florida, only to bring them back right before one of the most important matches of the summer.\n\nIt\u2019s not just risky, it\u2019s poor planning. Players are now dealing with potential fatigue and disrupted sleep cycles from a delayed flight. There was zero tactical advantage to leaving, considering the match is happening in the same city.\n\n\nTo make matters worse, the entire situation highlights how the USA is simply not capable of hosting these kinds of major international football events properly. Between the unpredictable weather, awful scheduling, and logistical mess, it\u2019s clear this country is not ready for the World Cup in 2026 either.",

That leaves us with only Fede, Jude, Arda and Cama. It's a long season and we need a top level passer and rhythm controller. \n\nFew names came up before CWC, Angelo Stiller seemed the best fit, but I can no longer see any news about him. Is he still available? What is preventing us from signing him? \n\nMost likely, Rodrygo is leaving this window, if we got \u20ac80+ for him, other clubs will know we have cash and will start asking more for their players. So we shouldn't we sign a CM before selling Rodry? ",
