        "title": "The disappointment that is our team\u2019s current state of attack",
        "content": "I hate to keep complaining about our forwards but their performances have just been so disappointing. Game after game, we look more disjointed. Even the number\u2019s arent lying, we score so little and concede so much. Especially with the fire power we have on paper, the stats should be much more stronger.\nNow the general argument for the cause of this is that we have 3 right footed LWs playing 3 positions. They all have similar traits, ie they wanna beat the defenders 1v1 and shoot/cross. None of them wants to make a run into the box to wait for a cross or any defensive error to get a tap in.\n\nLet\u2019s look at PSG. One of their best wingers, dembele, has successfully shifted to the middle we without any fuss and he\u2019s having a balon dor level season. He\u2019s happy to play through the middle because he knows he\u2019s much more dangerous from close range. In the wings they have Kvara, barcola and dou\u00e9,  are all right footed players but they can operate on both sides. It is no wonder they have so much more balance. Plus They all track back without making too many sacrifices in attack so psg suffer a lot less while defending. \nwhereas we have to witness our forwards running into each other, not tracking back, trying to be too individualistic. I have never seen so many turnovers in attack as i have this season.\nSo who do we blame the most here? The manager who doesn\u2019t have cojones to drop/tell off underperforming players? Tiredness? Well all the teams have similar schedule. Ive seen a 36yr old lewandowski do things for his team that none lf the 20somethings do for us. He\u2019s happy to play almost every week too. Or the players who strut around in the pitch with their multi million dollar pay check. \nI believe Wednesday is the last chance for this team to bring back the belief that we can achieve big trophies this season.\n",

Why is Barca 10x better this season than last? It's not because they made 10 new signings, it's not because Pedri and Cubarsi improved 10x over the summer. It's because Hansi Flick is 10x the tactical manager that Xavi is. There were so many times last season when the likes of Pedri, Raphinha, etc. got the ball and had no idea what to do with it. This season, the entire Barca team is clicking like a well-oiled machine, with everyone knowing exactly what their role is. \n\nThrowing these young players out there, especially against a top team like Arsenal, without clear tactical instruction is akin to the WW1 British generals telling their young soldiers to charge straight into machine gun fire ",
