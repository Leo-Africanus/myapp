My favourite player ever is Raul.\n5.

We let kroos leave last year and did not sign the replacement same thing happening this year with Modric leaving and us not signing replacement. 2 creative engines left and we didn't even bother to replace even one. How confident are u guys about the upcoming season??",

        "title": "Backslash against Rodri signing in online media and fans is preposterous",
        "content": "It is not congruent with our history or goals.\n\nContext:\n\n1 - We have lost 4 - 0 against Barsa, PSG. 0 - 5 against Arsenal. 2 - 0 against Liverpool. Chelsea defeated PSG 3 - 0. Arguably they would have defeated us as well.\n\n2 - WE have very good reinforcements, but not better than the others. Check Arsenal (Zubimendi, Gyokores and some more quality on the bench). Check Liverpool (Kerkez, Wirtz, and still seaking more). PSG was so superior that our signings arguably has not close the distance.\n\n3 - Who we are and what we want? We are REAL MADRID. We want to be in the group of favourites, we do not want to be smashed by everyone.\n\n4 - What is our weakest spot. Tempo organization, defense and moving ball from the defense against high pressure. That is why Xabi wanted Zubimendi. Thats why Kroos told that Rodri would be a good signing. Thats why Midjatovic also wants a midfielder. Our forwards are the best on the plannet.\n\nBut if ball wont arrive to them they will against look subpar. Vinicius was the best in the world because Kroos ( and in second half Modric) make ball arrive to him in advantageous positions where he could use his superiority.\n\nRodri pre injury was the absolute behemoth of world football doing the 2 things we need the most in this team. His impact in the game of City and of the Spanish Team was gargantuan. Without Rodri suddenly Bernardo, De bruyne were sub par (similar to our players without Kroos). Without Rodri the defense of city became warm butter\n\nHow someone can be against this? Really how?\n\n\\- Because of Vini? Do you think Vini is a children? He would be delighted to have a director who helps to elevate his game again.\n\nYou know that Marcelo and Ronaldo have a big fight before Ronaldo came to Madrid? And then they were the best friends.\n\n\\- Because of injury? 60% pre injured level Rodri still would help or midfield MASSIVELY. Rodri pre injury is a player that would have been impossible to sign. Is a bet but the reward/risk ratio is magnificent\n\n\\- Because his Atleti past? Remember Courtois? The guy who become one of the best goalkeepers on our history? Atlei past only make it sweter for me. I will love to see Atletico fans crying.\n\n\\- Because he is 29? His 3 best years are to come. Coincidentally the years that probably will be the best of Mbappe and VIni also. Do you want to waste Mbappe and VIni best years? Or you want to shoot to the moon\n\n\\- Because of Camavinga and Tchouanami? Common. First there is enough games for everyone. And second both would benefit of learning of the best midfielder of the generation post Modric Kroos. When Rodri will retire Camavinga will still be young.\n\nPlease people, be serious.",

        "content": "I've been looking at the market Mbuembo, Cunha, Ekitike..etc. going for 75mill+ each and that is without the bonuses. We have teams that want to bid 80+ for Luis Diaz who is 28 years old. \n\nIdk how we rarely see clubs offer big money for our players. We are clearly willing to let Rodrygo go, he has proven himself on the big stage and is also more marketable than these players.\n\nIf a one season player like Ekitike goes for 70-80+ from Frankfurt. Shouldn't Rodrygo go for 100m+ easily?\n\n  \n",

        "content": "Been noticing a lot of pointless dramas inside the community especially on twitter and Instagram and It is not what the team needs right now. \n\nOur players are active on social media, contrary to what people think. For example, this is like [the 3rd post ](https://x.com/kingbeofguler/status/1948120928120098839)I've seen in the past few hours alone with alot of likes trying to create a rift among Real Madrid fans. I seriously dont understand this No. 10 drama. Arda had only a couple of months of starter level minutes what has he done to deserve the no. 10? It took Yamal 2 years of consistent performances to get the no. 10. \n\nOn the other hand, despite a few rough months at the start. Mbappe played out of his mind and managed to get the Golden boot which is something that only  happened to 2 players in Real Madrid history before Mbappe, on his first season. Imagine if he adapted from the start, he would have had some record breaking numbers.\n\nThis Vini Vs. Mbappe drama is also not something the team needs right now, they need to be partners and not rivals. Mbappe has managed to adapt the central forward role and it is something that Xabi Alonso clearly wants to continue with. He wants out forwards to be more centrally and our wing backs and Midfielders to overload the wings. Mbappe just needs to work on his work rate cuz everything else he has been amazing at.\n\nThe point is that the community and the players need more unity otherwise we are lose. The players will have another bad season and the fans will be dissapointed. \n\nI'm sorry but these things are less important than getting silverware. I'm starting to think that people are more like Vini and Arda fanboys than Real Madrid fans. ",
