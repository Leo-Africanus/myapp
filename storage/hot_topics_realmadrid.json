He was paired up with a traditional striker (Giroud) which allowed him to roam to the left &amp; cut in when needed. We can't do that now because Vini is undroppable apparently, plus he's in good form right now. \n\nThe only other solution (that allows both Vini &amp; Mbappe in the pitch without them overlapping) is putting Mbappe at RW with Gonzalo or Endrick as striker. Endrick is on loan ofc, so Gonzalo it is. Its worth a try imo. He's played there before &amp; was great at it. He was a RW during the 2018 World Cup which France won.\n\nOfc in such a scenario, Valverde will have to cover for Mbappe's low defensive contributions, but Valverde is a workhorse and can manage it imo. Selling either one of Mbappe or Vini is unrealistic. This seems to be the best choice imo.",

        "title": "This has been going on too long",
        "content": "I'm just going to get straight to the point.\n\nMbappe pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n\nFast, Great Finisher, great at penalties \n\nCons:\n\nTerrible off ball movement, Zero hold up play, Terrible playmaking, poor link up play, terrible work rate, terrible pressing. Cannot play as a striker, cannot play as a winger, can barely beat a man and can barely cross.\n\nSo the question is, are all these cons really worth the one or two good things he does really well, maybe better than anyone else in world football.\n\nMbappe had it easy at PSG, league was pretty much guarantee, he didnt have to be brilliant, he had lots of space to exploit against weak opposition and he also had Messi, Neymar who can create something from nothing. With Cavani he had someone that would do all his pressing for him allowing him to focus on scoring.\n\nThe truth is most half decent managers and teams have figured him out. Sit deep and dont allow him space to exploit and he doesn't have the dribbling in tight space that Rodrygo and Vini has and doesn't have the off ball movement of Jude (who i believe is actually being wasted as a midfielder now, he's a striker like ekitike)\n\nThen there's the obvious, people say why did everyone suddenly become worse, we have tried to blame everything else, we blame Kroos leaving, Vini ballon dor, Jude, Tchouameni, Valverde, Brahim, we have tried to blame everyone and everything else but using occams razor the right explanation is usually the one requires the least assumptions and the simplest explanation is team declined massively since Mbappe joined.\n\nYes Kroos leaving was bad but it should not nearly be as bad as what we are seeing today but that's a post for a different day. When Mbappe joined the team was still doing well with different goal scorers but Mbappe was struggling to adapt to the pace and physicality. To solve this every single person made a direct effort to try and get Mbappe scoring at their own expense. Vini started giving up penalties and taking less shots, Jude started making less runs into the box and everyone was trying to make Mbappe the star but this came at the expense of team balance and cohesion.\n\nIts funny we always ramble on about \"PROFILES\", we need this type of profile blah blah but when it comes  our striker, all of s sudden profile doesn't matter. What type of profile is Mbappe as a striker. He doesn't hold up the ball to bring others in, doesn't make runs into the box to score headers and tap ins, hes not a false 9, he's not a target man, he's not any of these, but since he scores lots of goals, the problem must be everyone else.\n\nThe goal Gonzalo scored last week, he didn't need skill or pace or trickery, he mad a simple run and Trent gave a pass and he was able to score. \n\nRobin Van Persie had, no pace, no strength, not particularly skillful, but he could finish and he knew where to be and when to be there. Nothing is more evidence of this when Guler had the ball and Mbappe literally stood infront of Vini on the left wing, and it took him a good 5 seconds before he realized he should move because Guler didn't pass to him. \n\nSo to everyone that wants proof that Mbappe is actually making others worse that's a perfect example. If Mbappe is dropped for one match all the Mbappe stans expect everyone to suddenly find form and score hattricks not taking into account just how much a difference form and team chemistry makes. Vini is actually starting to find some form and score goals now but especially when Mbappe is not on the pitch, same as GG, same as Jude, Rodrygo, Fede, almost everyone plays better when Mbappe is not on the pitch.\n\nPeople really seem to think if Mbappe is not on the team we would be fighting relegation which is ridiculous. If Mbappe was not on this team we would be a BETTER TEAM. \n\nRANT OVER, DOWNVOTE ALL YOU LIKE BUT IT'S THE TRUTH, UNTIL MBAPPE LEARNS TO PLAY HIS ROLE THE TEAM IS DOOMED.",

A player can be good and still not fit a team. Mbappe is essentially a winger. He\u2019ll never be a striker because he does not play like that.\n\nWe payed a massive bonus to a player who we did not need, and we have also given him so much priority. If we had a striker like Ekitike or Kane (closest thing to Benzema) we would have someone to run in the box. Someone to support play, and to take advantage of Vini\u2019s and Trent\u2019s crosses. I honestly see no way we start consistently playing well as a team without a 9. This is obviously not the only problem, our defense and midfield need improvement. But, It is crazy we dropped around 120 million just as a bonus, on a player we didn\u2019t even need. We shot ourselves in the foot.",

        "content": "This has been a discussion since before Mbappe was even on Madrid but I just don\u2019t know how we can succeed without an actual striker. Our crosses are to nobody and Vini\u2019s space is being affected. Don\u2019t let me get started on his laziness in pressing. Excellent player but we\u2019re literally turning into the old psg 2.0. I don\u2019t see how we can succeed if he refuses to change the way he plays for the team. Thoughts??? It\u2019s like we have individual brilliance but that\u2019s it",

        "title": "We lost the league mentality today, not just the match vs Osasuna",
        "content": "After watching the game and thinking about it calmly, the problem was not only the result vs Osasuna. The bigger issue was the mentality and decisions before and during the match.\n\nWe played like this game was not important. No intensity, no pressing early, no strong personality on the pitch. In this stage of the season (around matchday 25), these are the matches that decide the league. You don\u2019t rotate heavily here if you really want to kill the title race.\n\nResting key defenders and starting a shaky backline together was very risky, especially away in a tough stadium. You could already feel the lack of confidence from the first minutes. The first goal we conceded was basically a gift, and after that the team looked mentally fragile.\n\nOffensively, Vini was the only one really trying to create danger with his runs, but there was almost no support inside the box. Many times he beats his man and crosses low, and nobody attacks the 6-yard box. This has been a repeated problem for years.\n\nMbapp\u00e9 also looked disconnected. Sometimes he makes the run too early, sometimes he doesn\u2019t attack the space at all. Those small details make a big difference in tight games like this.\n\nWhat frustrated me more was the in-game management. The team needed changes early in the second half to increase width and intensity, but the reaction came late. And taking Valverde off after he gave us momentum was a very strange decision.\n\nOsasuna is not a weak team, especially at home, but the way we approached the match made them look stronger than they are. When you send a message with your lineup that the focus is somewhere else (like Champions League), the players also subconsciously drop intensity.\n\nReal Madrid is not always required to win UCL every year, but La Liga consistency is a must. You win leagues with seriousness in these difficult away games, not only in big nights at the Bernab\u00e9u.\n\nToday felt less like a simple loss, and more like a loss of focus on what should be the main objective this season: the league.",
