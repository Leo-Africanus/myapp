It\u2019s funny how many liked to claim that he had \u201cno tactics\u201d. Then we got a tactics coach in Xabi and he did not even last a full season. Ancelotti always knew what he was doing and how to manage the locker room. The more time goes on, the more I appreciate and understand his way of thinking. The only reasonable flaw I see in him is his tendency to not play youth players. Besides that, he always knew how to manage the team and how to adapt to the players. ",
