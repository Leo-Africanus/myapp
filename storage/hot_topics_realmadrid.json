        "title": "It\u2019s easy to blame Ancelotti, but what about Florentino?",
        "content": "This season, we got hit with a huge reality check, it really showed how important Toni Kroos was to this team. We started off completely unbalanced, with no ideas and the whole squad felt disconnected. Then Ceballos started getting more minutes and gave us a bit of hope. Suddenly there was more creativity and better flow, but even that wasn\u2019t enough, since he\u2019s an injury prone player.\n\nThen our defense collapsed. Carvajal got injured, and we were left with just V\u00e1zquez? and he\u2019s not even a RB. Nacho left and we didn\u2019t bring in a replacement. Relying on a 32 year old ACL injured Alaba, and keeping Vallejo the tourist, who stayed just because Florentino felt bad for him, and that\u2019s about it.\n\nMilit\u00e3o got injured, and out of all that negativity came one positive: Ra\u00fal Asencio. But even then, it took Carlo a few games to see it, choosing Tchouam\u00e9ni over him at first. Few players have been playing out of position and worn out, and who\u2019s to blame for that? \n\nSo how did we fail to bring in what we needed, especially a RB or CB? Particularly in January after the Cl\u00e1sico disaster. We all know Carlo asked for signings, but also why not give the academy players a chance as well?\n\nYes, there are many questions and this season has been a disaster. Injuries, Ancelotti\u2019s poor decisions, lack of tactics, no real rotation, over-reliance on individual brilliance up front and overall weak management have only made things worse. But seriously what are Florentino and the board even thinking?\n\n\nHonestly, it feels like Florentino has been more focused on helping Bar\u00e7a this season than fixing our own problems. It\u2019s clear he and the board are just as much to blame.\n\nThis is Real Madrid, and we\u2019ve been suffering since day one this season and it\u2019s been embarrassing, yet here we are, chasing free agents like a mid-table team and we\u2019ve worn out our players by playing them out of position. And the timing couldn\u2019t be worse because Bar\u00e7a have been unstoppable this season.\n\nI guess it\u2019s karma for all the laughs and mockery aimed at them and Xavi. But one thing\u2019s for sure, we\u2019re not going to suffer for years like a corrupt, broke club like Bar\u00e7a. I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll rise and dominate again. That\u2019s one of the many things I\u2019m proud of with this club, we lose players, but we rise quickly. We don\u2019t suffer for seasons like others do, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll bounce back next year.\n\nSo many question marks this season, but that\u2019s football. Sometimes this is what it takes to start over again. I know that we Madridistas are the most demanding fans in the world, but we have a reason to be and I know many of us feel the same way.\n\nI just hope Florentino and the board have learned from all of this during his final years as president, and I hope our next manager can bring us that joy again. I\u2019m grateful for everything Don Carlo Ancelotti has done for this team, but it\u2019s time for a new era.\n\nI just needed to get that off my chest.\n\nHALA MADRID!\n",

        "content": "As we are the kings of competition and our fan base has been spoiled with the success, it seems like we throw a tantrum whenever we are eliminated. Can't really complain as I threw mine yesterday after the bad results and the constant bottling and the bad performances. \n\nStill, has any of you face an elimination in UCL and just accept that it's football and sometimes you lose and sometimes you win ? \n\nI've been watching since 2011 and I will give mine :\n\n* 2011 elimination against Bar\u00e7a : first season with Mou, we were showing signs of improvements and Bar\u00e7a was just too good back then\n* 2012 : Bayern Munich elimination hurt.. the team did wonderful in the two legs, but Bayern was so good and we were not good in the penalties ( only Xabi Alonso scored his and despite Casillas saving 2, Kaka and Ramos missed theirs, CR7 scored a penalty in the game, but missed in the shootout, and it's prime Neuer )\n* 2013 : BVB was a serious competition for Bayern with their golden generation Lewa, Gotze, Reus, Gundogan, Schemlzer, Pisczek, Hummals, Subotic ran by Klopp. They trashed us in the first leg and I ain't even mad.. no formation overthinking or anything.. locker room was split back then.. and the fight the team showed in the final minutes in the Bernabeu, making BVB park the bus and shit themselves made love the team x10 mores.. we could have done better in the Bernabeu by not missing easy chances, but BVB were very good and even missed chances to kill the game. Won't forget Diego Lopez super save against Gundogan.\n* 2015 : Juventus elimination hurt, but I feel we were kinda unlucky and the game could have gone either way in both legs. Marcelo hit the crossbar right before Juventus counter for the 2-1 in italy..  second leg was not that bad, not that good either, but didn't feel like the formation was wrong or anything, we had our best players aligned up, we played like we usually do\n* 2023 : Don't scream your hearts out now lol that 4-0 against City hurt, but that same team eliminated City in the very next season. There is the whole Rudiger/Militao debate and I do think Rudiger should have started, but I think the real missed one in that game was Mendy instead of offensive LB Camavinga, and Mendy was injured... Haaland wasn't even that dangerous in that match, but City exploited Cama and Kroos spaces on the left. also we look at ourselves and refuse to give credit to the other team, City were monsters in that season and won the treble. We played well in the first leg but De Bruyne stole a draw with a powerful shot from outside the box.\n\n",

        "content": "An amazing example of this is current PSG. They are playing some of the best football in Europe right now, and have no trouble scoring any goals. Well, take a look at their attack. Dembele, a RW/LW. Barcola, Dou\u00e9, and Kvaratskhelia, who are all LW's also! The difference is, they have good rotations and all work for each other. The only reason it looks like Madrid need a number 9, is because against Arsenal, all they did was cross balls into the box. PSG doesn't spam crosses to get goals, they know their strengths and find other ways to score. They rotate all over the pitch, and try and open up spaces for each other to get in 1v1 situations, and hopefully capitalize on them. How many times against Arsenal did we see Vinicius and Mbappe 1v1 with space to run into and finish? Zero. A new coach is really what is needed, one that can find the strengths of Mbappe, Vinicius, and Rodrygo. Most of Madrid's attacks are just Vinicius running down the wing and trying to cross the ball back, with someone rarely getting to it. Mbappe hardly gets involved in the attack, which forces him to drop deep to receive the ball, leaving the box empty. Another reason why PSG are so successful is because of their fullbacks getting forward, which is why I think Trent is an amazing transfer. A tall number 9 isn't needed whatsoever, a new coach with a better sense of managing the attack is what Real Madrid really need.",

Mbappe has speed that isn't being utilized in the stricker position. Look at him at psg, or france, being able to run behind defenders is mbappes strenths. Formation is a 4 - 1 - 2 -1 - 2. Alaba, rudiger, rual, valverde.  Holding Mid: tchouam\u00e9ni. Midfiled: Modric, Bellingham. False 9: Vini. Wingers: Mbappe, Rodrigo. Why this will work. Defense doesn't need to be perfect but the 4 are good enough against a weak attaking team. Tchouameni is the holding mid with bellegoal being the box to box mid field and modric being the 10. Vini will draw space, with Mbappe and Rodrigo holding the width.

        "content": "(English Translation)\n\nWith the tough Champions League elimination against Arsenal over, the time has come for Real Madrid to analyze and make decisions. Not for next season, but rather for the end of this season. There's no time to waste. In any other year, they would wait until the end of the season, as they usually do, but this one is very different because the big objective they still have left isn't the league title or even the Copa del Rey final, no matter how tempting Bar\u00e7a might be as their opponent. None of that. The main challenge now is this first Club World Cup, which Florentino P\u00e9rez and Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel S\u00e1nchez have had on their agenda since the start of the season. For reasons of prestige, international exposure, and brand positioning in a key market like North America, winning the first edition of the brand-new FIFA tournament is considered a strategic objective. Therefore, they are considering what the best option might be to face this competition with the greatest possible guarantees.\n\n# Feeling of a completed cycle\n\nWe're talking about the coach, of course. Carlo Ancelotti has lost a lot of face this season, and his poor performance in the two legs of the knockout stage against Arsenal reinforces the notion among those in charge that the squad has long since let go of the Italian manager and his time is over. Normally, he'd play in the Copa del Rey final, and at the end of the season, unless there was a radical turnaround in the team's play and he won both titles, they would agree to terminate his contract as head coach and offer him a grateful exit, in keeping with his impeccable record. Furthermore, the Brazilian Football Federation has been waiting for him for over a year and would like to sign him in June.\n\n# A caretaker or Xabi Alonso ready for the Club World Cup\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that La Liga ends on May 25th, and Real Madrid's Club World Cup debut on June 18th against Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal. The club is exploring alternative options to Ancelotti taking charge if the team's erratic form continues or even worsens after the Copa del Rey final. It's about anticipating all possible scenarios. One option would be to appoint an interim manager, which could be Solari or Ra\u00fal. But the most suitable option would be for the new coach to take charge of the team weeks before the Club World Cup to work with the players, although many international players will be playing in the Nations League finals between June 4th and 8th or in World Cup qualifiers with their South American national teams. That new manager would be Xabi Alonso because he is the option that most convinces the president. The Tolosa native remains focused on his Bayer Leverkusen side, although he's waiting for a call from Real Madrid to activate the release clause that allows him to leave if Real Madrid or Liverpool (but not Bayern Munich) want him, in exchange for a fee as compensation for not seeing out the remaining season on his contract. It's another matter whether Xabi would welcome the option of taking charge in June of a team that's physically and mentally tired, ready to face a tournament as demanding as the month-long Club World Cup at the end of the season.\n\n\\---\n\nBased on this article we could have a new manager finalized within a month and officially signed before 1st June. I recently wrote a post on this sub related to this topic...\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/realmadrid/comments/1k15qcr/timing\\_of\\_ancelotti\\_departure\\_and\\_xabi\\_arrival/](https://www.reddit.com/r/realmadrid/comments/1k15qcr/timing_of_ancelotti_departure_and_xabi_arrival/)",

        "title": "Mbapp\u00e9's job is to score goals and he is the top scorer",
        "content": "I keep reading the \"3 LW\" complaint over and over, saying Mbapp\u00e9 is the problem, that we didn't need him, and that we need a \"real\" striker. However, for what exactly do you want a \"real\" striker over Mbapp\u00e9? So he can score goals, right? Guess what, Mbapp\u00e9 is the top scorer, fighting for the Pichichi, with more goals than anyone last season. He came to give us goals and he has delivered.\n\nDo we need an alternative, tall, expert header? Yes, of course, but Mbapp\u00e9 is still a great signing.\n\nPeople have told me \"but it's not about the goals\". Really? Football is not about scoring more goals than the opponent?\n\nMbapp\u00e9 is doing his job and he has scored great goals. He can do better, of course, I'm sure next season he'll be better adapted.\n\n\"But he doesn't press.\" No, he doesn't press as people would like, but that's the whole team. Ancelotti plays with a low block, so forwards cannot effectively press high. Pay attention to the games, see what's going on behind the forwards. When Vini, Mbapp\u00e9, or Rodrygo press the defender, no one is pressing one on one behind them, which means the defender has two or three open passes (fullback, goalie, midfielder). Then, keep pressuring is just a waste of energy.\n\nWhen the whole team is pressing, usuallynwhen we're down, Mbapp\u00e9 runs for the keeper or the defender, but this team pressure doesn't happen often. So their job is to populate the center, to prevent passes through that hallway.\n\n\"But Kane...\" He has very similar stats and was knocked out in the same stage.\n\nAnyway, our problems have more to do with defense and the connection the midfield should establish than with having an elite player that has scored more goals than anyone in the team.

        "content": "Tough defeat today, but I see this a lot in the threads :\n\n\"We have 3 nuclear weapons in the front and we don't know how to use them, it's coach's fault\"\n\nStupid take. That would be the case if you're playing FIFA on PS5. What you have is 3 fast right footed midgets, with brute force players in the midfield without a single one with decent build up quality to link defense and offense, and in the back, you have literally no fullbacks !\n\nThe front 3 is attractive, but not balanced ! Perez ruined a very good squad by buying a player we didn't fucking need and NOT replace 4 key players :\n\n1. Joselu, a tall cunt that wins most of his aerial duals and is always a threat in crosses. He was a downgrade of Benzema but thank god we had him to mix up our offense last season and he was VERY important !\n2. Kroos, a midfielder who has guaranteed &gt;90% pass accuracy,\n3. Nacho, a player who plays all positions in the defense\n4. Carvajal, our ONLY RB since 2014\n\nWatch the board buy another Brazilian midget by the end of the season !\n\nXabi Alonso, Klopp, Guardiola, Mourinho, none of them, separated or combined in any fucking way, will achieve shit with this squad either ! Easy to call out 'Carlo has no tactics' but you don't win chess games on high level with 6 bishops instead of the other pieces ! You need 2 Bishops, 2 Knights and 2 towers !\n\nCould Ancelotti have managed this season better ? Yes. Is he fully to blame ? Absolutely not and don't forget to shit on the board before shitting on the coach. Man asked for Harry Kane but got a CAM Bellingham so he switched the entire formation to fit him for a false 9 and it worked thanks to Vini wonder season.. So Perez decided to do this every fucking time because the next Brazilian midget he will buy will play as a left back because the board is to lazy to splash cash on an ACTUAL LB.\n\nY'all realize we have been playing for most of the season with 2 defenders in the 4 backline ? Tchou moved to CB and LV as RB are not their positions, Ancelotti's fuck up is not playing Asencio earlier, but it's sad to watch Alaba being average, then Fran comes in and he is just worse, together with Mendy's performances in this season. I don't need to talk about LV.\n\n3 Lewandowskis in the front won't work ! 3 Harry Kanes won't work ! 3 Sakas won't ! 3 Viniciuses won't work ! You need an actual number 9, an actual RW and an actual LW, but instead we have 3 LWs and people are like 'Any coach will destroy Europe with MVR' because they do in career mode on their PS5.\n\nWe can't win the UCL every season. Congratulations to Arsenal. Hala Madrid !",

Perhaps Endrick's movement and willingness to occupy different spaces unlocks a different dimension for Vini, allowing him more freedom or creating unique attacking angles we haven't fully explored with Mbapp\u00e9. What are your initial thoughts on this? Are we seeing a more natural understanding develop between Vini and Endrick, or is the established quality of the Vini-Mbapp\u00e9 duo still the superior combination? Let's hear your tactical breakdowns, observations, and any predictions for how these partnerships might evolve.\n\nMy evidence is when edrick came on vini was finding him with his crosses spot on. Endrick was just physically bullied and didn't convert. \n\n\nFull disclosure I actually think mbappe was horrendous. I liked him at first but after this season I'm not impressed in the least. ",

        "title": "Football is played on the pitch, not on social media.",
        "content": "I\u2019ve said it multiple times and I\u2019m going to say it again: Carlo needs to leave. He needs to leave because a legendary manager cannot continue to tarnish his legacy by what was being displayed by his players and by himself. Today, 7 out of 42 crosses were successful, Vazquez was seemingly one of our best players and the attitude of some players that are supposed to be leaders was downright embarrassing. Just like the title says, you play on the pitch, not on social media. \n\nThis is a lesson for the Instagram warriors that are our players and the admin of the club\u2019s account. For an entire week, we\u2019ve heard them say \u201cRemontada this, remontada that\u201d or \u201cwe\u2019re going to comeback\u201d or even \u201cremontada has been the most used word in the dressing room\u201d when a remontada DOESN\u2019T come out of thin air. 3-0 against Wolfsburg was thanks to a brilliant Cristiano Ronaldo, 3-1 against City in 2022 was thanks to a brilliant Rodrygo, Courtois and Benzema and etc. Do you guys see a pattern here? Every remontada has been thanks to players trying their hardest because they believe that they can do it and that they don\u2019t need to talk on social media to play their football. But what about today? We had:\n\n- Rodrygo Silva de Goes who has been invisible, yet AGAIN. His last goal being against Atletico back in march. \u201cOnly idiots forget the R\u201d. I know that he\u2019s playing out of position, but Raphinha has been playing out of position since the beginning of the season and is at 50 G/A+. Great players should always perform even if they play out of position.\n\n- Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 Lottin who wants to play as a central midfielder instead of making runs in behind. \u201cAdaptation period is over: I\u2019m going to be the one deciding matches now\u201d\n\n- Vinicius Jos\u00e9 Paixao de Oliveira Junior who, despite being the best out of the three tonight, has been seen hugging the touch line too much instead of exploiting the space centrally when Mbappe wasn\u2019t there and playing with Alaba when he was overlapping in the first leg. \u201cI\u2019m going to do it 10x more, they are not ready.\u201d\n\nWhat I hate the most in football are people who like to talk days before the actual game. We put out a disastrous performance in the first leg and you would think that the players and the coaching staff would learn from their mistakes and prepare at least **something** against Arsenal, am I right? I can understand that we\u2019re playing against the best defence in the Premier League, but this doesn\u2019t excuse the lack of solutions from Ancelotti. I mean, Courtois said in an interview that the players are doing what Ancelotti is telling them to do, they want to respect his wishes. Spamming crosses to nobody in the box or refusing to play out from the back isn\u2019t how you\u2019re going to win matches. Time and time again in today\u2019s match, long balls were being spammed when we know that our front three has no aerial threat, so why are we doing that? And don\u2019t get me started on David Alaba. He never should\u2019ve started at LB.\n\nPutting the blame on the coach and the players is unfair, right? So, how about we talk about the so called \u201cruthless president\u201d that is Perez and the idiots that run our board? It\u2019s maddening how Perez thought that adding another left winger to a team that already has two was a great idea. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Mbapp\u00e9 is a fantastic player, but he sure as hell **WASN\u2019T** the player that Madrid needed. \n\nEveryone, Madridistas and neutrals, could see that Madrid needed a REAL number 9 to finally have the aerial threat that they had been lacking ever since Benzema left the club. Vini\u2019s best season has been when he had a number 9 to rely on so what does Perez do after seeing that we need a number 9 and that Joselu has been a fantastic player when it comes to aerial threat despite being on loan? He buys another left winger because Galactico! The result is a disjointed attack with three guys that want to play on the left, leaving 34 years old Lucas Vazquez essentially playing as the RW and Valverde running from defence to attack just to cover the gaps left by Vazquez. But hey, the board is there to help, right? Of course not. We have bums that consider Eder Militao, 2 ACL injuries in two years by the way, the \u201csigning\u201d of next season. Bums who clearly see that we desperately need fullbacks but chose to renew Vazquez. Clueless idiots who will come out on an interview and say \u201cwe won two champions league, so everything will be okay\u201d when we are getting outplayed by every big team either at home or away. When will this circus end? When will these human beings finally acknowledge that our squad depth is embarrassing and that spending 50 millions on Dean Huijsen who has been fantastic for Bournemouth and Spain isn\u2019t something to be ashamed of? Is the club just a joke for them? I speak for every Madridista when I say that we love this club with passion and that we will continue supporting Real Madrid no matter what happens, but we are not idiots. We can see that the club is not going well and it is **INFURIATING** to see the people in power not doing a single thing to help this cause. Real Madrid is the greatest club in the world and a club with such a title should not be allowed to be so immature when it comes to transfers or squad depth. The board and Perez are supposed to be helping the manager with signings, so why aren\u2019t they doing it?",

WHY the fuck did real madrid sign mbappe ??? and more importantly. Why the fuck did mbappe sign for madrid ?? Does neither mbappe nor mbappe's agent realize that he has nowhere to play in madrid ??\n\nEvery single time a coach has tried to play mbappe at ST they failed. Why did he and ancelotti and the everyone behind this signing think 27th time's the charm ? Or was the plan to rotate between him and vinicius ? the top 2 left wingers in the world fighting for 1 spot ? You already play a world class left winger out of position. now you have 2 playing out of position.\n\nThe fact that mbappe seems to actually be trying to play ST and isn't actively complaining makes me think he thought about this and thought he is gonna suddenly be a striker when he signs for madrid. But i think he is realizing day by day that won't happen. Or is very hard. Your natural position isn't something you can easily change at 26. Especially when you are the best in the world at it.\n\nImagine trying to play salah, the greatest right winger in PL history. as a striker or left winger even when he was 26 ? he'd be average at best. average as in mid to lower table level in the PL maximum.\n\nOr did ancellotti and everyone responsible for signings at madrid think they are playing fifa career mode ? i don't get it.\n\nThis reminds me of the coutinho signing for barcelona. They wanted a neymar replacement who could hug the touchline and provide width in the final third. They bought one of the best central playmakers in the premier league. absolute stupidity on both the player and the team's end. same thing here.",
