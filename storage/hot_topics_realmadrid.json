Since I need to plan my trip and book place to stay as well as plane ticket, that's kind of late for me.\n\nShould I be worried about tickets availability? From what I've read, only reliable ticket providers are RM official webpage and in front of stadium, right?\n\nI'll be staying in Madrid for the weekend and I'm planning tour on stadium day before the game, probably going back home on Monday, so if you have any any other advice, what to visit, where to go, what to see, can you share with me?\n\nThanks a lot",
