His ideal role is probably the play as a #8 and #10 hybrid like KDB, he can still help the build-up with his playmaking but his best quality is his goalscoring and chance creation ability as shown today. Also have to mention that Arda is #4 among most big chances created in LaLiga this season in this team with 9 big chances created, while Vini has 10 and Bellingham has only 4 despite playing a lot more.\n\nThe only problem is that Bellingham has been playing this role already, I wonder how a midfield would work if Bellingham played as a box-to-box with Arda getting more freedom in offense as a midfielder.

Yes he is an elite Athlete and may have the stamina for it, but if Mbappe is tracking and defending as much as expected, then is he still as open and ready as needed for counter attacks where he can use his speed to beat the opposition defence for instances like over the top passes or quick counters with an isolated defender etc? \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\uddd0\ud83e\uddd0",

We\u2019ve criticized Ancelotti, and we always do. We\u2019ve criticized Florentino P\u00e9rez and the board, and we always do. Everyone bears some responsibility.\n\nBut let\u2019s be clear\u2014this is not an isolated incident, nor is it the only match with this many poor refereeing decisions going against Real Madrid.\n\nIt\u2019s always important to highlight the responsibility of the coaching staff and the club\u2019s management first, but that doesn\u2019t mean we should ignore how much Real Madrid has been harmed by refereeing this season. Today\u2019s match was just another example.\n\nAt any moment, Celta could\u2019ve equalized\u2014and had that happened, Madrid would\u2019ve officially been out of the La Liga title race. A race that could\u2019ve been over long ago if not for poor decisions\u2014both from within the club and, more importantly, from the referees.\n\nIf that had happened, we\u2019d be criticizing Mbapp\u00e9 and Vinicius Jr. for missed chances, we\u2019d criticize Ancelotti for his substitutions, and other players for poor decisions. But with a better referee today, the outcome could\u2019ve been completely different.\n\nAnyway, congrats on the win. Ancelotti and the players need to keep doing their part. There are four matches left\u2014Barcelona, Mallorca, Sevilla, and Real Sociedad. Winning all four doesn\u2019t guarantee La Liga, but we need to do our part and hope for a slip-up from our rivals.\n\nI hate being in this situation, but it\u2019s partly our own doing. Still, let\u2019s not forget the external factors. I just hope Ancelotti leaves with a legacy we\u2019ll always remember fondly.",

I\u2019ve never been to a Real Madrid game before, and as a huge fan of Arda G\u00fcler and Mbapp\u00e9, the thought of seeing them live is unreal.\n\nI\u2019m seriously considering buying a ticket, but I\u2019m a bit hesitant. Do you think Madrid will bring their top squad for this tournament, or is it more likely they\u2019ll rotate heavily and send mostly subs?\n\nFor those of you who follow Madrid closely or have seen how they approach these kinds of tournament\nwhat do you think? Is it worth going?\n\nThanks so much!\n",
