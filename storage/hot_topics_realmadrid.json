        "content": "Obviously we have a serious problem in the defence and desperately need reinforcements. However, I am not convinced Trent is real Madrid calibre - hear me out. Just because he wants to join doesn't mean we should just get him based on the fact it's a brilliant deal. My problem with Trent is his defensive capabilities. Yes he's on of the best wing backs going forward with incredible playmaking abilities. However if you consider Alphonso Davies joining who is also incredible offensively but shaky in defence, could leave us seriously vulnerable at the back. \n\nWe won the UCL final against Liverpool a few years back because Trent doesn't know how to track a runner and left vini free at the back post. In addition to the fact the team is already unbalanced with too much attacking minded players and not enough defensive, hence our shaky defense all season. \n\nThis is why carvajal is the best RB in the world the last few years imo, due to how solid he is in defence and how much he fights wingers the way R\u00fcdiger fights strikers, In classic old school fashion. \n\nThoughts?",

Based on what I\u2019ve read online, my best option seems to be getting tickets from reselling platforms like StubHub. However, the prices are shocking\u2014an above-average ticket costs at least \u20ac400 on every resale site I\u2019ve come across in this subreddit.\n\nInitially, I was also hoping to grab a cheaper below-average ticket if Madrid make it to the UCL semi-finals on April 8th or 9th, just to experience the magic of the Bernab\u00e9u on a Champions League night. But seeing how expensive resale tickets are even for the Valencia game, I\u2019m starting to doubt if that\u2019ll be possible.\n\nIf anyone has tips on how international fans can find tickets at more reasonable prices, I\u2019d be so grateful!",

        "content": "Keep in mind we will have to play extra knockout games before the round of 16. Additionally, the revamped structure ensures that no team will have an easy path to the final.\n\n  \nRealistically, I don\u2019t see us making it past the semi-finals this season. Obviously we've only reached halfway through the season, but our performances so far haven\u2019t been convincing, especially against the bigger teams. \n\nThat said, this team has a knack for defying expectations and pulling off miracles on the biggest stage. So, while my realistic prediction stops at the semi-finals, I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if we somehow ended up lifting the trophy lol.\n\n  \n",

The answers were a bit mixed, but I wanted to ask this question here in our community, since we have so many clutch players who have left a massive impact on the tournament.\n\nWho would you consider the top three clutchest players in Champions League history?\n\nNot the most clutch players, but in our current squad, I consider Rodrygo, Vini and Courtois to be very clutch as they seem to perform even better when the stakes are highest.",
