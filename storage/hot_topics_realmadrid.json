        "content": "I am planning to visit spain and was hoping to catch the Valencia game on 6th April. However, the date and time hasn't been confirmed yet. Since it can be on any day between Friday-Monday, planning the trip has been a little difficult as I can't stay in Madrid for that long. \n\nI know the schedule comes out around 3 weeks before the game so I should probably just wait it out, however the more I wait the more expensive flight tickets get. And since there's a 2 week long international break in March, I don't know how or if it may impact the final schedule release.\n\nIf anyone knows any information regarding the schedule, please help me out!\n\nThanks!",
