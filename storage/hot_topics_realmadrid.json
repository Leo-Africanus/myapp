I was wondering if real betis is a threat to real madrid in terms of taking points from us in 2025 because if we lose to them twice we are in trouble. Antony cost \u20ac95m and is almost on same level as Vinicius Jr in terms of technical skill, and that scares me when real madrid gonna play against them. Whats ur thoughts?",

He will likely be leaving at the end of the season, and MAYBE Xabi comes in. Ancelotti has won 3 CLs in 6 seasons with Real Madrid. Two of those CLs with a squad sub par compared to Zidane\u2019s. He has had to deal with injuries, world class players leaving the squad, at times lacking financial backing for signings, a strong opponent in Manchester city (in the CL) and so many more things. Despite this, he\u2019s won everything for us in such a small amount of time. He\u2019s brought in world class players to build the Real Madrid of the future. He\u2019s faced every criticism with dignity and class. He\u2019s the most decorated European Coach in history. Yet our own fans with little to no football knowledge and management criticize him for small things like \u201cNot subbing in Arda earlier, blah blah blah\u201d. I will always back Ancelotti. I\u2019m glad to say I never folded on him like some of the fans here. Hala Madrid y Nada Mas. ",

Coming at no additional cost, hopefully the club gives him chances/few games before breaking the bank for Trent.\n\nAfter loosing on academy gems like Hakimi and \u00c1lex Jim\u00e9nez, the club should not make the same error with Fortea.
