Sure rudiger is getting old and all and had an underwhelming season, and asencio played horribly at the cwc, konate isnt what the team lacks. Of all defensive mistakes you look in the squad, and honestly majority of it is from positioning. We need a high iq cb with incredible vision, who can position himself, not give any space to the opponent, someone who can intercept, track back, hold the defensive structure like a glue, and fit in xabis tactics.

In 2013, as a winger, he was nearly unplayable\u2014dribbling, long-range goals, and sheer explosiveness. But in 2016\u20132017, he shifted more into a striker role, delivering clutch goals in the Champions League and showing insane efficiency.

Since today marks Vinicius' 25th birthday, I've decided to go ahead and collect all the data about his goal contributions throughout his career for **club and country.**\n\nI don't think it's a surprise seeing Barcelona topping the list since he has played so many games against them.\n\nWhat's interesting in my opinion is the fact that Liverpool and Manchester City appear on this list. This shows his great performances in big games in the UCL.\n\nNOTE: All the data has been collected by myself, I used sources such as fotmob, besoccer and flashscore. it may differ a slightly bit from what Transfermarkt shows. For example, Transfermarkt gives the player an assist if he gets fouled inside the box and his teammate scores the penalty (check Brazil-Colombia 2-1), which normally shouldn't be the case for an assist.\n\nI am  open for suggestions and recommendations on what to improve visually.",

Without Valverde in the midfield he couldn't do much.\n\nSeems like Xabi Alonso wanted to make him the playmaker of the team. He got very good vision and passing, along with a lot of distance covered and pressing. But he needs to learn how to cut off the passing lane instead of just hustle the players. The teams also needs to trust him and protect him well.",

But the amount of hate and negativity being thrown around specially towards Mbappe is a little too much. \n\nYes, he hasn\u2019t been pressing. Yes, the system is new. But let\u2019s not forget that he\u2019s only played three games(was out sick, lost 5 kgs) two off the bench. The actual season hasn\u2019t even started yet. Players are still building fitness and chemistry, and Xabi Alonso is still figuring out the system.\n\nCriticism is okay, that\u2019s a part of football. But what I\u2019m seeing isn\u2019t just criticism, it\u2019s pure hate. We wanted Mbapp\u00e9 for years, he did okay this season, and now some fans are turning on him, let's not be too quick and let Xabi have his time with him. He's arguably the best in the world currently and Xabi will get him to play that way. \n\nLet's just step back and let Xabi do his thing. ",

        "content": "Xabi Alonso looked very promising during the Club World Cup, particularly against Salzburg and Juventus, where he deployed a 3-at-the-back system. This setup fluidly allowed Tchouam\u00e9ni to support both midfield and defense, showcasing tactical flexibility and control. Those 2 matches makes me very excited for the future. \n\n For those who followed his work at Bayer Leverkusen, what happened after that unbeaten season? Why didn\u2019t Leverkusen maintain that same momentum in the following season? Was it injuries, transfer departures, or just the natural pressure that comes with high expectations?\n\nCurious to hear people\u2019s thoughts on both his recent performance and what went wrong after such a promising start at Leverkusen.",

        "content": "To me the biggest issue is that our midfield never has the ball against big teams. We always struggle to even get the ball in the first place so does getting a creative midfielder really fix that? But I guess that's why we're gonna be using the 3-5-2. But at the same time it's kinda crazy because all these other big teams could get the ball with only 3 midfielders so why can we never do the same?",
