        "content": "This season hurts because it feels like we could have done more. It did not end the way we dreamed, but when I look back at these years under Carlo, all I feel is gratitude.\nWe lived so many unforgettable moments together. The comebacks against PSG, Chelsea, City. Nights where it felt impossible but somehow we believed, and somehow we made it happen. The Champions League, the Super Cups, the League titles. All the happiness, all the emotions, we owe a lot of it to him.\nEven when things were bad, Carlo gave us calm. He never disrespected the club, never created drama, never lost his class. He always carried himself with dignity and love for this badge.\nNot every season can end with a trophy, but it is the memories and the journey that stay forever.\nIt hurts to say goodbye but he deserves this next chapter with Brazil.\nThank you Mister for everything you gave us. For the victories, for the faith, for the moments.\nYou will always have a place at Real Madrid. You will always be one of us.\n\n\u00a1Hala Madrid y nada m\u00e1s!\n",

He sells us dreams and hopes of his ability for a couple of weeks every season then just goes ghost. \n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of how he\u2019s had to adopt a more defensive role thanks to Lucas Vazquez or if it\u2019s some confidence/mental thing, but so many times I just find myself forgetting he\u2019s even on the pitch.\n\nThe difference between him and Vini is that Vini, even on his worst games, he still fights. He still makes things happen. Whether it\u2019s beating a defender and sending a cross in, shots on target, hell, even a G/A. He makes things happen and his presence is always felt.\n\nTo put things in perspective, Mbapp\u00e9, in his DEBUT season, is only 10 goals away from equaling Rodrygo\u2019s total LaLiga goal count. That is just crazy to me. I\u2019d like to know everyone\u2019s thoughts here. Am I rushing to conclusions and being reactionary? Or is this truly a player that is just not at the level of a  Real Madrid starter?",

The board sabotaged him by not signing a Kroos replacement, not signing any defenders, signing mbappe wich broke the teams ballance and so on. Another complain I\u2019ve seen was the style of play that these players are not passing enough and suffer at building attacks, but yet again I think that\u2019s what the players can do, that\u2019s their limits. The only thing he got wrong this season was the teams mentality, usually that was he\u2019s strong point but kind of hard to work on crybabies mentality. The minutes issue with Endric and Guller, I don\u2019t see a issue with that, they didn\u2019t look that good until the end of the season so was he really wrong for not using them until now?! ",

Mendy, on the other hand, has struggled one setback after another and hardly clocked the minutes required to reach top gear, leaving us short on that attacking push. Add in that Fran is easily one of the fastest players in our squad\u2014able to burn past wingers and still sprint back into position\u2014and you\u2019ve got a full-back who blends flair with defensive grit. He\u2019s built real understanding with our center-backs and midfield, while Mendy\u2019s stop-start season has kept him on the back foot. If you desire a left-back who's fit, in form, and can switch defense to attack in the blink of an eye, I do think Fran Garcia clears Ferland Mendy.\n\n",

Tactically naturally we are a bit lost, so that's a huge task in and off itself, but after the classico display ito player behavior (that being the flashpoint, but many individual incidents prior) will he be able to get the buy in needed.\n\nLike ZZ he is a legendary ex-player, so that should buy him latitude, but I worry if the squad will be receptive. Naturally Flo will play a significant role by supporting the manager and putting faith in him but from those of you that watch more Leverkusen than me, and especially those that have followed the clubhouse news, what information is there on Xabi's man management?\n\nAt the very least he needs to be able to get buyin from the forwards to track back and be more involved in the buildup play, which Carlo has struggled to do outside the biggest games. This is for me a huge cultural issue as much as tactical. Getting that buy in will be critical.\n\nAnyway just a pretty open ended question to see what you guys think about our path forward? Even if it's just to say we don't need cultural corrections... \n\n",

The 2024/25 season is starting to mirror the events of the 2014/15 campaign in some uncanny ways.\n\nBack in 2014, under Carlo, we started the season on a high, winning both the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup. Expectations were massive. But as the season went on, things began to slip. We fell short in La Liga, got knocked out in the Copa del Rey, and exited the Champions League in the semi-finals. To make matters worse, Barcelona capitalized on our decline and went on to win the treble.\n\nCarlo was sacked at the end of that season. He was replaced by former player Rafa Ben\u00edtez, but that experiment didn\u2019t last long. By mid-season, Ben\u00edtez was gone, and another ex-player stepped up: Zinedine Zidane, who went on to carry us from chaos to glory.  \n\nNow, fast forward to this season. Once again, we started strong by winning the UEFA Super Cup, and we have CWC to play. But despite the solid start, there\u2019s an unsettling sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, key injuries piling up, dropped points at crucial moments, and doubts creeping in just when we need momentum the most. Meanwhile, Barcelona are finding their rhythm and are in the mix for a potential treble once again (HOPEFULLY FUCKING NOT).\n\nTo top it off, Carlo is set to depart, not by sacking this time, but via mutual agreement and with another former player likely stepping in to take the reins. The parallels are undeniable.\n\nMaybe it's fate. Maybe it's the end of a cycle. But just like last time, I believe this could be the foundation for something even greater. After all, what followed 2015 was the beginning of one of the most dominant eras in Champions League history.\n\nLet\u2019s hope we\u2019re about to witness another rebirth. What's your thoughts guys?",

        "content": "Seeing that Xabi is currently in the lead to become real's next coach, I just got done watching a video explaining how Xabi is likely to set up our formation. the video made me question a couple of things, with the main questions being about our current squad and possible transfers in the summer.\n\nthe youtuber in the video, Stratman Dave ([here](https://youtu.be/037cyizkWpU?si=rR1l5V73ZJ5ApC-j) is the link), assumes that xabi will play the team in a 3-4-2-1 formation, with rodrygo filling in the 'grimaldo-role' as left wing back. i, however, am not convinced that this role suits rodrygo. although he is able to defend to some degree, i think he isnt a lwb, and probably wont be what xabi is looking for if he were to play with one. this made me doubt rodrygo's future in real more, as he also has not been good at the usual right wing position. garcia would be our only option, as mendy was introduced as the left center back in the video and alaba is likely gone.\n\n  \ni personally think garcia is a solid player, and ideal to have come off the bench when needed. i don't see him as the starting left back in the team. this made me wonder: who do you think the club should target in the summer IF a move were to be made?\n\n  \nI was also thinking about our need for a back up striker. more of a natural #9 that can come off the bench and be a threat in the box with size and aerial skills. someone like joselu would be something that I hope we will pursue in the summer. ancelotti has emphasized crossing a lot in his offensive schemes, but we have lacked length since joselu is gone. endrick has been great but is not someone we should rely on as our sole back up striker.\n\ni really wonder if there are others who share this thought. xabi's style of play will undoubtedly involve crosses in the box, and seeing that we are gonna have trent who is elite at this, i genuinely believe that this team will benefit from having an actual striker off the bench. i haven't done much research on who this might be tho.\n\n  \nyour thoughts?",

        "content": "This isn't a post defending Rodrygo. I'm just bringing up his case as a perfect example of how lot of fans dramatically change their mind within the span of few weeks, sometimes just one week.\n\nRight after we lost the against Arsenal in El Bernabeu, Marca asked people to  \nvote which players should leave this summer. I'll paste here the most relevant part and I'll provide the link for those who want to read it:\n\n\\&gt;The question was simple, but forceful (Which players should leave in the summer?)... and the answer couldn't have been more direct  \n\\[.......\\]  \n**&gt;Jes\u00fas Vallejo** received 12% of the votes \\[...\\] He narrowly surpassed (11%) **Lucas V\u00e1zquez**, \\[...\\] The list of culprits is long and sharp. **Alaba followed closely (10%), then Ancelotti and Mendy (9%)... before surprisingly reaching Vinicius (63,000 votes).**  \n\\[.......\\]  \n**&gt;As things stand, Courtois gets the best grade of all (7.16) and Vallejo the worst (3.19). In total, 14 players passed (Courtois, Valverde, Asensio, Bellingham, R\u00fcdiger, Brahim, Ceballos, Lunin, Modric, Mbapp\u00e9, Carvajal, Endrick, Rodrygo, and Camavinga) and 10 failed (the rest of the squad and Ancelotti).**\n\n  \nLink: [https://www.marca.com/futbol/real-madrid/2025/04/18/aficion-mira-palco-exige-dos-fichajes-venderia-vinicius-verano.html](https://www.marca.com/futbol/real-madrid/2025/04/18/aficion-mira-palco-exige-dos-fichajes-venderia-vinicius-verano.html)\n\nThat was only 1 week ago. The votes were pretty much in line with what many people was saying on this sub after that game.\n\nThose with good memory should remember how for most part of the season how many people used to name Tchouameni as a player who should be sold, and Vinicius (best of the world last season according to most fans) was very often mentioned as a player an attacker that should be sold.\n\nRodrygo or Mbappe were barely mentioned if someone asked if any of our attackers should leave.\n\nFast forward two weeks and nobody thinks Tchouameni should leave, almost nobody mentions Viniciuys should leave but lot of people think Rodrygo should.\n\nNow some will claim that they never asked for Vinicius to be sold but they always asked Rodrygo to be sold. Well, maybe you in particular didn't but the facts are there. If are one of those who claims this or the other certified great player should be sold then I don't believe you, and if you think Rodrygo isn't a great player (despite his performance this season) then I'm sorry but I gotta laugh at how little you understand this team sport.",
