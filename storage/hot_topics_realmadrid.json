        "title": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 at Real Madrid: Stat padder or Contributor? Narrative vs Facts (OC)",
        "content": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 at Real Madrid: Stat padder or Contributor? Narrative vs. Facts (OC) \n\nIn recent weeks, I've heard lots of \"riveting\" commentary about Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and how all he does is pad his stats since he signed for Real Madrid. Not only is that claim false, but it's one that's based in narrative and is wrong. To prove it, I will use facts and statistics. A novel concept, I know. Does Mbapp\u00e9 stat pad or contribute for Real Madrid? Let's take a look. \n\nTo disprove this claim, I'll only use statistics such as goals and assists and then compare it to Madrid's overall success in terms of games won or lost. \n\nFirst, let's look up \"stat padding\" and find out what it means. This is a term used in all sports, but I'm keeping it within a football-related boundary. From a football standpoint, stat padding is when a player focuses on boosting their personal statistics (goals, assists, etc.) in ways that offer little benefit to winning and team success. It's when a player selfishly accumulates numbers instead of providing genuine contribution for the team. \n\nSince Mbapp\u00e9 arrived in June 2024, Real Madrid has played 94 matches. Of those 94 matches, Mbapp\u00e9 has played in 83 of them. He's missed 11 matches because of injury or suspension. Here's what I found: \n\nKylian Mbapp\u00e9 (83 games, 83 G/A - 73 goals, 10 assists) \n\n* 2025-26 (26 team matches; 24 matches played) \n   * 33 G/A in 24 matches (29 goals, 4 assists) \n   * 19 games out of 24 that Mbapp\u00e9 scored/assisted = 79.2% win rate \n   * A record of 16-2-1 in those 19 games = 84.2% win rate \n   * A record of 2-1-2 that Mbapp\u00e9 didn't score/assist = 40% win rate \n* 2024-25 (68 team matches; 59 matches played) \n   * 50 G/A in 59 matches (44 goals, 6 assists) \n   * 35 games out of 59 that Mbapp\u00e9 scored/assisted = 59.3% win rate \n   * A record of 30-2-3 in those 35 games = 85.7% win rate \n   * A record of 9-3-12 that Mbapp\u00e9 didn't score/assist = 37.5% win rate \n* Total number of games in which Mbapp\u00e9 scored/assisted \n   * 54 games \n   * A record of 46-4-4 in those 54 games = 85.2% win rate \n* Total number of games in which Mbapp\u00e9 didn't score/assist \n   * 29 games \n   * A record of 11-4-14 in those 29 games = 37.9% win rate \n* Total number of games Mbapp\u00e9 scored or assisted / games played \n   * 54 games out of 83 = 65.1% win rate \n* Total number of games Mbapp\u00e9 didn't score or assist / games played \n   * 29 games out of 83 = 34.9% win rate \n* Madrid's overall record when Mbapp\u00e9 plays \n   * 83 games \n   * A record of 57-8-18 = 68.7% win rate \n* Madrid's overall record when Mbapp\u00e9 isn't playing \n   * 11 games \n   * A record of 7-3-1 = 63.6% win rate \n\nAs you can see, Mbapp\u00e9 plays a role in Madrid winning. When he plays and contributes, Madrid's winning rate ranges from 65-85% and an overall team rate of 69%. When he plays and doesn't contribute, Madrid's winning rate ranges from 35-38% and an overall team rate of 31%. \n\nOf the 83 games Mbapp\u00e9 has played, the only game where he truly stat padded was against Espanyol at home in La Liga last season. Madrid won that game 4-1. With the score at 3-1, Mbapp\u00e9 scored a late penalty to add to the lead. Before then, with Madrid leading 2-1, he contributed an assist to Vin\u00edcius to make it 3-1. He simultaneously stat padded and sealed the game. \n\nYou're probably thinking: \"Well, how many of Mbapp\u00e9's goals and assists have come in crucial moments for Madrid?\" Of his 83 G/A, 78 of them have played a role in Madrid tying, taking the lead, or putting the game out of reach. 69 goals and 9 assists total. \n\nUnder these \"clutch categories\" (tying, taking the lead, or putting the game out of reach), Real Madrid's record is: \n\n* 53 games \n* A record of 45-4-4 = 84.9% win rate \n\nWith the knee injury Mbapp\u00e9 just picked up, we'll be missing that contribution for some games. At the same time, Madrid has a winning rate of 63.6% when Mbapp\u00e9 is out so it's manageable. \n\nHis \"stat padding\" is contribution and that contribution has been a 1 G/A per game average since his arrival. Calling it stat padding is a narrative which simply discredits what he's done for Madrid so far. He impacts winning, team success, and even clutch moments. Get better soon, Kylian. \n\nSource: [besoccer.com](http://besoccer.com) ",

        "content": " With the whole Karl claiming he wants to play for Madrid one day I realized our fanbase is not as bad. So many Bayern players crashing out over their player claiming that one day they want to play somewhere else is crazy. He even had to turn off his comments because he kept getting hated from full grown adults. I hope that if one day one of our players comes out and claims they would like to play somewhere else at some point, we do not do the same as Bayern. It\u2019s funny because I had Bayern as one of the best fan bases. Same with Liverpool, and then the whole Trent thing happened. It seems like when a player is going to Madrid they just hate to see it. I would not crash out over it unless one of our players pulls a figo. ",

The last canterano to score a hat-trick for us in Beranbeu before Gonzalo was Raul in 2003.. And what an outrageously good hat-trick too.. Gonzalo has similar characteristics to Raul\u2019s game.. The off the ball runs, the technical quality, and the work ethic.. Hope he gets more minutes to prove himself. Also, let\u2019s remember Raul for what he was- A Madridista through and through.
