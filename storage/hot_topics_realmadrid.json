I get that G\u00fcler is the flashier name right now because of his fanbase but let\u2019s be objective: Nico Paz is the one who looks more committed to actually developing and earning his spot in the long term. He\u2019s leading the charts for most chances created in Europe\u2019s top 5 leagues for under 21 players, and he plays for 13th place Como. He already knows our team, he\u2019s trained with the first squad, he\u2019s had minutes with them, he understands the dynamic and the expectations. That matters. We have a buyback clause of 8 million this summer. I\u2019ve been seeing a lot rumours of him being linked with Inter lately and Serie A fans really rate him. I think it\u2019d be a real shame if we don\u2019t bring back a youth player.  ",

        "content": "Hello,  I hope it is okay to post this here. In the fall, my boyfriend will turn 50, and I plan to take him to a Real Madrid game. I want to make the day special for him and wonder if anyone has any ideas. We are traveling from Norway.\n\nWhat would you include in a special day for a Real Madrid fan? What would you want in a day like that? Does anyone know of any special places he would love to visit before the game, related to football? If it matters, he is fluent in Spanish, so language is not an issue.. \nAre there any football pubs or merchandise stores we should visit?",

I don\u2019t want to watch all the games but some, also in popular games do members tickets get sold out? Also when I go to the website I don\u2019t see the option to buy tickets as a member.\nThanks!",
