I recall one of the best games we had was with the narrow diamond formation. No wingers and 4 midfields and Mbappe and Rodrygo up top. Ceballos was amazing that match (which I can\u2019t recall which one) and controlled the midfield great. While Bellingham was playing as a shadow striker and trying to get strikers off rebounds or open passes. To me it seems that a lack of a good midfield is what messes up our team. We should give up some attack to focus on control and defense. We could even try to play long ball and try to get the ball over the defense since we have really fast players. What do you think the best tactics/ formations would be for the team? ",

        "title": "What would Real Madrid have done compared to Brentford",
        "content": "Let's look at Brentford setup prior to their goal today in the premier league.\n\n1. They forced all Arsenal players to stay in their box by crowding the box. Brentford had 5 players in the box forcing Arsenal to put 8 players in the box. This resultantly freed up the wing for Brentford who had so much space.\n2. They created an overload on the flank with two players\n3. They crossed the ball.\n\nWhat would Real Madrid have done differently? Well\n1. Pass back to the midfield.\n2 Or try to get Vinicius to run past the defender. If he runs past the defender, Mbappe stays outside the box, expecting a cut back in the form of a pass not a cross.\n3. Not cross the box and try to pass their way through inside the box.\n\nThese two opposites shows why having players occupy the box will be so important in the second leg. Vini and Mbappe got on a through ball in the first leg but nothing resulted from it. We didn't get such opportunities after. \n\nIf we occupy the box with good amount of players it will force Arsenal to possibly put more players in the box and allow our wingers and RB/LB to create overload on that side. If we keep trying to pass the ball, they will maintain their shape and it will be a long frustrating night IMO. Our wingers staying wide will not be enough, it will only be enough if our wingers stay wide and Arsenal players stay inside their box. To do that, we must make them believe that a cross is coming and actually attempt crosses.\n\nAlso, Brentford forward players came back to defend. Vini and Mbappe are lazy bums who need to do better. They need to track back. We cannot let Arsenal maintain their shape all night.\n\nThoughts for second leg?",
