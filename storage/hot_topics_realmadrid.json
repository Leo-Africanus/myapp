Quick thoughts, anger, frustration, future lineups, players we should get rid of and sign, etc. Most of these posts have been removed.\n\nSimilar to the announcement that I made after the Arsenal loss, please direct these to the post-match thread and the open thread. There are too many posts going up right now that it\u2019s flooding the home page and most are getting removed. If your post is lengthy and generates its own discussion by itself, it could be posted in the future. There is too much urgency in the sub right now for everyone making their own post. \n\nThank you for your time \ud83d\ude0a ",

A great team takes their loss like a champ especially when it's your own fault not the refs or the managers.\nSure the refs last decision was a little questionable but you can't throw or cuss him. \nThis issue needs to be addressed by club itself. Vini going down after every tackle, even me whos sitting thousands of mile away, watching on 360p on buffering stream can see that was  clear ball and then he has the audacity to ask for a card. The cherry on the top is that he then just gives up. No or very little attempt to retake the ball. \nBesides, it goes deeper after arsenal game carvajal was choking saka, rudi standing on mls like bruh come on. You're setting a bad example for the juniors. \nSomething really needs to be done, we've become a laughing stock Infront of the world.\n",

We saw how Arteta demanded respect and inlisted discipline into his players. Flick has shown that he can be a friend to his players and take no nonesense. \n\nI really hope Xabi is a manager that takes no bullshit. I dont care who you are, if you are lacking disciple, u need to get benched. \n\n\nI honestly love how Mbappe is coolheaded.

        "content": "Watching the game yesterday, it felt like some players were trying too hard to make something happen on their own instead of trusting their teammates. Vini had moments where he could have passed to Mbapp\u00e9 but chose not to, and Brahim also missed chances to find G\u00fcler, who was often in great positions.\n\nEspecially in the final third, the decision-making was delayed \u2014 Vini in particular seemed to hesitate too much instead of playing quickly. It felt like players either wanted the glory themselves or didn\u2019t fully trust the options around them.\n\nI genuinely think we left 2\u20133 goals on the pitch because of it. This is one big difference between us and Bar\u00e7a \u2014 they move the ball quicker and always seem to find the man in the better position, leading to more goals.\n\nCurious if anyone else saw it the same way?\n",

        "content": "After yet another loss to Barcelona this season there's a lot of frustration and a lot of people will jump on to some players who might've not had the best game or Ancelotti who yet again loses to Flick. And while I do agree with that and I agree that Ancelotti's time with Madrid has come to an end, I do think there's a bigger problem here that most people haven't noticed. This problem is Florentino Perez.\n\nThere's no denying he's one of the best presidents Madrid has ever had from a success point of view and especially from a financial and economic point of view. But for a while now, Perez has been kind of a dictator. He very rarely backs his managers with players that fit their tactics. Hasn't backed Ancelotti this season with a defender for example despite the very obvious lack of quality and depth in that position. Pretty much chooses the players he buys based on their marketability and how much merch they're going to sell.\n\nAnd on top of that, he's lately making enemies with pretty much everyone around us. It started with that Super League he wanted to create which has put us at odds with UEFA and FIFA, then against Javier Tebas the league president and finally against all Spanish referees with this whole campaign that Real Madrid's channel has made and these leaked rumors that said Madrid might not play the final which I have no doubt that Perez is behind. And regardless of what you guys think about his stances in these \"feuds\", you can't deny it's putting more pressure on even our own players and causing them unnecessary distraction.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is Perez Madrid's real problem?",
