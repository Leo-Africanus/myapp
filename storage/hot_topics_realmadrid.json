When we are winning and smashing teams, they stay and when we don't, they talk big and criticise and switch clubs.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti was not our only problem. It looks like our players are just not there playing for the ball anymore.\n\nI watched every UCL game of us and our forwards barely track back and we cant string even 10 passes in line. There is no fluidity in the game and we always keep losing the ball\n\nLong passes in the box where there is no one to head the ball inside the net. It's like our players look lost and we cant see Mbappe or Vini as the X-factor anymore. It's like our players forgot passing after Kroos left our team.\n\n\nI am sure that Ancelotti would have requested for defensive reinforcements but maybe Perez denied this requests to save money to splash in the main transfer window. But blaming all this on Ancelotti is completely wrong. That guy is the best in what he does. His tactic isn't to smash 10 goals in a game but to simply win one anyhow. He is the  type of good old time manager.\n\nI respect Ancelotti and  I think he is in the conversation of all time best managers. A Carlo Ancelotti appreciation post.\nThank you boss, Adios maybe after this season.\n",

        "content": "The Brazilian told the coaching staff after the match against Celta (a game he didn't play in again) that he didn't feel strong or up to playing at the time. He completed four training sessions during the week, but his feelings weren't particularly good.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti decided to include the Brazilian in the squad for the match against Barcelona in an attempt to protect a player who has been very important in the Italian's four seasons in charge of Real Madrid. But since last February, his importance, in terms of his contribution to the game, has disappeared. Curiously, this season began with doubts due to the BMV issue, but he managed to turn things around. However, this time, he wasn't included in the plans during the week of preparation for the match.\n\nRumors and doubts about his future:\n\nThe substitution in the Cup has been a definitive blow to his morale, to which have been added the numerous rumors that have appeared about his future, which has led to a situation that is not to the liking of the footballer.",
