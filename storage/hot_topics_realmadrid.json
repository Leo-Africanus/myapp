Last season he was hitting 2.88 key passes per 90 in limited minutes (99th percentile stuff) and now he's tracking at 5.0 chances per 90 this season. When you consider only Kroos and Modri\u0107 have created more chances historically for us among midfielders, it feels like we might be watching something special develop right in front of us.\n\n\n\nCould this finally be his breakout year where he becomes undroppable? And how do you see him fitting into our long-term midfield plans alongside the other young talents?",
