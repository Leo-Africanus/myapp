        "content": "This one dribble by Endrick is better than anything Franco Mastantuono has shown us this game. With how short Endrick is, and with how good Mbapp\u00e9 is, I think RW is the perfect position for Endrick. Before he goes away on loan, I would love for Xabi to try Endrick at RW rather than at ST.\n\nI like Franco's energy, but he constantly loses the ball, he can't dribble, and he doesn't score goals. Yes, he brings good energy and helps in defense, but that's all. I think that Endrick has more to bring than Franco for now. If it were up to me, I would give Endrick more playing time as an RW than he's being given now.\n\nI'm not saying that Franco should be benched, but how is it fair that Franco gets so much playing time when he's not really delivering all that much? Franco has already had, in the 3 months he's been at the club, more playing time than Endrick has had since he joined Real Madrid 15 months ago. Endrick has scored 7 goals, and Franco just 1. Surely, I'm not the only one who has been thinking about this. **Play Endrick at RW, not at ST.**",
