No Madrid fan would ever call them a legend but they really put in a shift \n\nThe most conspicuous name I have for the current is Brahmin Diaz. Very tidy player. Very skillful and almost unbeatable on his day.\n\nThe other ones I can think of are Savio, who was always entertaining, Steve McManaman and Guti (although I guess he may be viewed as a legend to some)\n\nCan you tell me of any more of this type?\nI'm obviously not talking about the Raul's and Zidanes etc",

Anyway the thing is I bought the tickets on 1boxoffice, costed around 600\u20ac for category 1 premium, is it good enough ? Like he won\u2019t be too far ? Also it says the ticket are gonna be received 24h prior to the match, isn\u2019t it too short? Has someone bought ticket on the website and had a great experience? I\u2019m sorry I have too many questions but I\u2019m so new to this",

That, coupled with Madrid not making a formal offer to Bayern in the summer, left Davies in doubt about whether the Spanish club really wanted him. There have since been talks between Madrid and the left-back\u2019s agent this season, but nothing concrete, despite some reports to the contrary in Spain",
