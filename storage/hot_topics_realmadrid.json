Because he excels in breaking down the low block with his close control and creativity and precision when linking with other teammates. Vini on the otherhand is brilliant on the counter, but when faced with a reluctant low block is less effective, we then get less chances in the box, and he gets more frustrated especially when playing away. \n\nThis game faced with a low block team, Xabi started with Rodrygo because he trusts in Rodrygo linking up well and surgically getting into the box. This resulted in us having 17 shots in the first half with 8 shots in the box. Then with Oviedo needing a goal and pushing up, Vini was subbed on and secured the win with his brilliant counter attacking threat. \n\nIf Rodrygo is still a Madrid player and Xabi sticks to this plan even at home, we could see Rodrygo starting against Mallorca.

        "content": ".. is how quickly he brings young players into the first-team setup \u2014 no need for long phases of \u2018learning curve\u2019 or \u2018gaining experience.\u2019\n\nWe saw Gonzalo Garc\u00eda starting in the Club World Cup, and now Mastantuono is already getting minutes in his very first two matches with the team, even though he joined us few days ago.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m pretty sure that if Ancelotti were still in charge, Gonzalo wouldn\u2019t have even been considered for that World Cup. He would\u2019ve just played it safe and pushed Bellingham up as a false nine. As for Mastantuono \u2014 we know how that story goes. He\u2019d spend months with Castilla, late sub appearances when we're winning 3-0, maybe start a Copa del Rey game against a third-tier side, and then be loaned out the following season.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen that cycle too many times.\n\nFor the first time in years, it feels like we\u2019ve got a coach who truly trusts the young talents and isn\u2019t afraid to throw them straight into the action when they\u2019re ready \u2014 no unnecessary waiting and \u2018developing\u2018. \n\n",

The opponent is not very big team and he has his chance, he needs to grab this and show that he deserves to be the starting LW.\n\nAnd for now, vini needs to understand he's no longer the irreplaceable in the team and has to work his way through the bench in the starting 11 like he did 4 seasons back. \n\nI like this competition for a position and it's a good thing to have healthy competition for a position in this club.\n\nHala Madrid!",
