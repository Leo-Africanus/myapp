First, looks like I was right to say Misa should flee, here even in CL, Pau has no interest in playing her. I assume maybe our \"captain\" will get to play a Copa Del la Reina match if she's lucky.\n\nSecond, the Antonia injury was as bad as the stretcher made it look. No timeline on her return, but it is more serious than they thought.\n\nI hope we have a good performance tonight, we have some tough opponents so hitting the ground running is a must. I just wonder what it will take for me to come round to Pau's way of coaching. ",
