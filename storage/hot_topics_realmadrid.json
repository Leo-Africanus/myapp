I always enjoy being in this stadium.\u201d\n\nHis spectacular farewell at the Bernab\u00e9u\n: \u201cThe whole day was spectacular. Weeks before, I'd already said I wanted a farewell at the Bernab\u00e9u when we had nothing left to play for, and that we should finally be champions so I could enjoy it. That's exactly what happened, and from the moment I left home until I returned, I enjoyed it.

        "content": "**On AC Milan**\n\n\"I always said that after Real Madrid everything is a step down, everyone can confirm that. But I think I've joined a club that is very close to Real Madrid in terms of reputation and history. It was an ideal situation for me.\n\nWhen the Milan option appeared, I knew that was it. I stayed at a high level. The Italian league is one of the most competitive in Europe, it is not easy to play. But ot was an easy choice for me. Especially because of the approach of the people and the club.\"\n\n**On his departure from Real Madrid**\n\n\"Leaving Real Madrid wasn't easy, I spent half my life there. That was one of the best periods of my life. I arrived quite late, at 27, but I was ready for that leap. Four years in England helped me a lot. Everything after that seems unreal to me, what I achieved.\n\nIf someone had said to me: \"Write what you would be happy with at Real Madrid\", I would have been afraid to write everything I achieved later. Trophies and victories are aside, but staying at a club like that for 13 years... From 27 to almost 40, that's something incredible.\n\nWe know what Madrid is like, a club that doesn't tolerate mediocrity. Staying at a club like that for so many years is the most incredible thing. When I arrived, I thought it would be great if I stayed for five or six years. I thought careers lasted until 33\u201334. Not only have I surpassed that, I'm still at that level.\"\n\n\"Staying at Real Madrid was really my big wish, it wasn't just platitudes or flattery to the fans. Sometimes some wishes don't come true. Even though my wish to retire in Madrid didn't come true, I achieved some things I never thought I would. I don't regret anything. I never expected this in my wildest dreams.\n\n\"The love of the fans, the club and all the people connected to the club remains forever. I have no words to thank them for that treatment. It was like that from day one. Even though I had difficulties at the beginning, I felt the love and affection of the fans. They felt that I was the one. That gave me the motivation to give back to them in the best way.\"",

The gap is huge, and as much as it's great seeing him be in such an amazing form, it's also a warning for the team that we need our other forwards to start contributing more.\n\nIt's been such a weird period since El Classico with lots of yapping from the media, which, even though it's mostly nonsense, it would still affect the team. So, hopefully with the wave of comments from the players and Xabi after yesterday's match about sticking together and focusing on helping each other, this would bring the team back on track and we resume the upwards momentum we've built up to our match against Barcelona.\n\nThere are things to fix, but as long as the board is supportive of Xabi and the players are fully bought into this new era, we're going to be a very competitive team and we've seen it earlier in the season, we just need that aggression back and we should be good!

Right now, though, we lack creativity in midfield. Honestly, when was the last time we scored a truly beautiful team goal, like Olymp\u2019s opener against us?",

        "content": "At least from the sample of matches we've watched in the Xabi era, is it not clear that Arda's best position is 10 and the team looks better put together when he is in that role? \n\nThink of it this way, Arda was making dangerous passes to the offensive players and moving the ball forward very well yesterday. The connection with mbappe is undeniable at this point. \n\nI like camvinga and he had a great assist  and some good defensive work, but he looked shaky on the ball.  Imagine Jude playing that role, he's an upgrade on cama in every way. \n\nArda is also not selfish, he looks to link up with players as soon as he has the ball. Jude is usually looking to dribble and place himself also in scoring position. If anything, Arda should look to shoot a little more. \n\nThat's not to say if Bellingham sees an opening he doesn't drive or crash the box, but in that case Arda has to drift over more to the right (which is Madrids weak point in the last few years, or drop back to cover ala Modric style.)\n\nGranted, olyimpiacos is one of the worst teams in the UCL, but Madrid at least found it's footing and looked dangerous. \n\nI think both players are phenomenal. What Jude did in his first year was legendary, but what's best to help the team seems Arda at 10 and Jude at 8. Am I right? ",

        "content": "This guy is unbelievable. I lost count how many times we were pissing down our leg in the back and when we finally get the ball to him, this guy whips it a crazy distance across the pitch with insane accuracy to beat the press. Not to mention his ability to instantly change the situation, literally one second the opposing team is on the attack, trent stops it, and sends it down the other end of the pitch to vini or mbappe the next. His ability to immediately shift the situation from us stopping their attack, to the cbs chasing vini or mbappe from recieving a trent pass in mere seconds is unlike anything the rest europe currently has to offer.  \n\nAfter his injury recovery im assuming he wasnt 100% fit up until recently. but speaking strictly before then (before the marseille injury), when he was alternating starts with Dani, idek how this guy was sitting on bench, or wtf Xabi was seeing in practice. because everything i've seen on the pitch from him has solved a large amount of our ball progression out the back and has formed a sort of band-aid over the fact that we still lack a deep-lying playmaking MF atm. \n\nI get ppl have reservations about his defensive awareness, but as far as I care, he hasnt made any huge defensive blunder in a madrid shirt. maybe a few lapses, but those happen to any defender. And those would only continue to decrease as we continue to get guys back from injury and strengthen our backline in the upcoming summer. Especially playing alongside guys like tchouameni/fede. \n\n  \nTLDR: this guy is gonna be a generational pick up for us",
