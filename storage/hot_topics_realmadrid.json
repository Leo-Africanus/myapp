By polluting the conversation of these two players with only negatives and narrative of inherent incompatibility we as a fanbase are only serving to create more of a rift. \n\nThese are arguably the two best players in the world. Vini\u2019s \u201cbad season\u201d is one where he contributed more g/a in the UCL than games played. And still recorded 21 g/a in La liga. He\u2019s also only a year removed from a balon d or season and has contributed more g/a in the UCL than any other player across the last 5 seasons. Mbappe bagged 31 goals and while he also struggled last year when it came to link up play his contribution shouldn\u2019t be understated.\n\nRather than spread a narrative of incompatibility,  lack of motivation and selfishness (God forbid a player is trying to negotiate the best contract for himself) let\u2019s have faith that it may take two of the best in the world more than a single game under Xabi to find their best form.",

I feel bad for him because he had to go through racism, getting robbed off an award and now his form has dipped. Nonetheless, we can\u2019t just mindlessly support him and act like nothing happens. We can\u2019t just act like he didn\u2019t play horribly this year. But most importantly we can\u2019t ignore his attitude. I have no problem supporting a player during tough times. I would go far and more for Valverde. However, the problem with Vini is his behavior and ego. Vini is asking the club for more money and trying to shine over Mbappe. I think it is pretty evident by this time that Vini and Mbappe don\u2019t work together. If a player wants to be over the club and act un accordingly they can leave no matter who they are. On the other hand Rodrygo may be a worse player than Vini but has always played out of position for the club and been humble. I believe that Vini needs to stop being defended as much as he is. Every true Real Madrid fan knows no one is above the club.",

        "content": "Personally I think our midifled is creative and are being held back by a lazy attack who refuses to make appropriate runs and confuse the defense. Take garcia for example always moving around getting into good positions that\u2019s why he got so many goals. Compared to vini who runs to the wings and Mbappe who stands still instead on constantly making runs and moving around. Not to mention if Dean and Trent aren\u2019t playing passing back to the defense is the same as giving the opposite team possession because they aren\u2019t capable of being calm and passing that ball back. I think midifled creativity and control really isn\u2019t the anywhere near as big of a problem as people think. I think it\u2019s the people surrounding them that needed the most improvement. But we still need stiller not only are we losing Bellingham we lost modric , Kroos, and possibly ceballos so we need depth and even once Jude is back assuming we play 4 mids we will have only 1 CM option of the bench. What are your opinions ? I personally think defense should be our biggest priority ",

        "content": "Just thinking back to that Champions League run in 2021/22 still gives me goosebumps. Honestly, sometimes I sit here and I *still* can't quite believe we pulled it off. Comeback after comeback... it felt like every single round was a movie script that no one would have dared to write because it seemed too unbelievable!\n\nFrom PSG to Chelsea, then that crazy City game, and finally lifting la Decimocuarta against Liverpool, each step felt like climbing a mountain. But our players... they left EVERYTHING on that pitch. They played with a spirit that was just unmatched.\n\nThere were moments where it felt like it was over, done. But this is Real Madrid, and somehow, some way, our boys found that extra gear, that bit of magic, to turn the impossible into reality. The Bernab\u00e9u was a cauldron, a true force of nature pushing the team forward.\n\nThat run wasn't just about winning; it was about the heart, the passion, the never-say-die attitude that defines our club. It\u2019s a reminder of what\u2019s possible when you wear that white shirt and fight until the very last second.\n\nEven now, years later, whenever I think about that incredible journey, it fills me with so much joy and a sense of limitless possibility for Real Madrid. What a team, what a spirit, what a run!",
