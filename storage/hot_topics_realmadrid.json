        "content": "The haters would say \u201cbecause mbappe and Bellingham weren\u2019t there\u201d. Meanwhile there has been multiple occasions where Madrid played just like this. 2-1 vs Barca, 3-0 vs Bilbao, 6-1 vs Monaco. \n\nThe reasons why Madrid \u201clook better\u201d are as follows:\n\n1. Sociedad isn\u2019t a low block team. Madrid historically always play better against teams that don\u2019t sit in a low block even if that means they lose sometimes (against city this season for example)\n\n2. Second and most importantly Trent Alexander Arnold. His passing ability is something Madrid desperately needs. His cross field passes, through balls through defensive lines opens up so much more for Madrid. \n\n3. Mbappe and vini payed for dinner. This one is obviously a joke but an act like that from two of the main stars can go a long way. So from now on they must pay for dinner before every game. They will also have to pay for breakfast on UCL nights. ",
