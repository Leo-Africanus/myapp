        "title": "Alvaro Carreras Profile",
        "content": "After reading the transfer news on Alvaro Carreras I decided to watch the Benfica - Braga match today\u2026 Here are my thoughts. Carreras is not yet a Champions League knockout full back.\n\nDefending: This is a strong point for Carreras. He is a very strong 1-1 defender, his performances against Lamine Yamal here. He has a good ability to read the game and is very good in the tackle. His performance today also underscored this as he made a game saving tackle before the goal. His height is also another strong point. This is encouraging because if he were playing alongside TAA I imagine Carreras could tuck in more when TAA goes up and still defend well against more physical forwards. One thing that concerns me is his work rate, to be frank Carreras looked tired today against Braga. Frequently he was caught up field and noticeably slow coming back. \n\nIn Possession: This is the biggest problem. Carreras vs Braga today made multiple unforced errors and was unable to effectively progress the ball. I understand the numbers tell a different story but this is the Portuguese league and against better teams like Braga today I believe he will struggle. The man could not string two forward passes together and reminded me of Mendy, it looked like his Benfica teammates were afraid to pass him the ball. Ultimately Carreras is very raw and I think that there will be a marked improvement as he matures because he does have the technical ability to succeed. However, this would be our starting LB and his quality in possession will have a negative impact on the biggest games next season.\n\nAttacking: Carreras is an attacking fullback and he does perform well further up the pitch. Especially with space he has ok crossing (at least it\u2019s better than Mendy) and he does succeed in dribbling the ball. He\u2019s a good enough threat especially if paired with TAA where he might stay further back and let Vini command the left.\n\nFinal thoughts: Carreras looks very raw. He has the potential to be a very strong player in the future but his performance today vs Braga was very bad. Ultimately I think that he\u2019s still only back up quality for Madrid. He reminds me of Mendy\u2019s profile early on in his Madrid career. All this to say I do think that other options, especially Theo, should be considered. Carreras will not be cheap and he will be one of the weakest players in the starting 11. If we end up with him and Fran as our LBs I see it costing us games.",

        "title": "My review and feeling of Vini's Documentary",
        "content": "The tempo and narrative of the film itself is slightly fragmented compared to the other RM player documentaries I have seen. The growth of the game and the discrimination issue are not particularly well connected, and the time narrative is also a bit messy. The gaps between the Real Madrid seasons are too big, which affects the rhythm.\n\nHowever, the content is still very valuable:\n\nThrough this documentary, the most clear thing to understand is that Vini was not unknown before he came.  He didn't play many games because he was very young. While emerging in the Southern America Youth Championship, he was also recognized by Flamengo and attracted the pursuit of big teams. And Real Madrid's 45 million also proved that the team valued him. At that time, it was enough to enter the top ten highest transfer in the club's history. Even during the first season, as an 18-year-old teenager, he could already play as a quick winger, and then he grew steadily. If RM had bought Mane at that time, the result would definitely not have achieved Vini's level. A club needs to have a long-term vision to see the next few steps to establish true fame.\n\nIn addition to the talent of a Brazilian genius, he did not become decadent in the bright lights and wine after becoming famous like many stars. He is very serious and hardworking in recovering from injuries. This is very rare and worth learning for many people in the team. The failure of Hazard, Jovic and others is not because the players are not talented enough, but their professionalism seriously damaged their career and even adds a lot of trouble to the team.\n\nAmong the coaches, only Ancelotti has been interviewed. It is obvious that it is he who gives Vini trust and freedom, making him the best player in the world. Although Solari did not make an interview, he is a very important person for the growth of Vini and gives the little bear enough opportunities to stand out.\n\nAnd we can clearly see that the growth of Vini has been suppressed in Zidane era. It is understandable that his family has some issues with it. But at the same time, he also improved Vini's defense and mental strength. I think Zidane can fully see the talent of him, but some of his obsessions in the tactical system, especially the emphasis on ball possession, led to his lack of trust. This is also the key to his failure to go further in his 2nd term. After all, no one is perfect.\n\nThe club's overall support and protection for him is also very good. They let his family come, and also arranged a nutritionist and physical trainer for him. They firmly stood on his side in external conflicts. No matter discrimination or the Ballon'Dor.\n\nAt the same time, after seeing so much mindless discrimination and attacks, I think the response of Vini and Real Madrid is right. There are too many problems in Spain and the European league that restrict the development of football. And most of the current FAs are simply incapable of solving them. Tebas's performance in this documentary is an example. Only under pressure can he make concessions and apologize. Keep silence will only make them more unscrupulous. Only when we speak out and get support will they apologize and make concessions. I think the series of actions of RM board are also in the hope of improving these problems in Spain, so that good players can get a better environment, and the football league will be further improved. The Premier League also learned from the tragedy and formalized, and established a relatively better environment before it rose later. With the further internationalization of football, there are more and more talented people of different ethnicity. Spain needs such a fair and clean environment to attract these talents.\n\nOf course, Vini should play football on the field and trust other teammates for negotiation. Because compared to playing football, negotiation is not what he is good at. He has a good mentality in football and is not afraid of the opponent's strength. However, his personal emotional control and leadership speech still need to be improved. This aspect is very similar to Sakuragi Hanamichi. From his teammates' comments here, we can see that everyone thinks that Vini is a talented player on the field, a lively child off the field and very serious in training. He can be the ace card but not a leader yet.\n\nSeeing that people like Kroos, who grew up in a completely different environment and culture from him, can achieve such a high degree of consistency and mutual recognition in football, we can also appreciate the charm of football. Rudiger also said that Vini is like his little brother, very young but good at playing. He is very focused on football. \n\nOther than that incident, Benzema also praised and taught Vini. A genius like him obviously fully recognizes Vini's talent, but he thinks Vini should be less emotional when dealing with things on the court.\n\nBut the one who impressed me the most was Courtois. He was one of the few who analyzed the troubles and defects encountered by Vini and also recognized Vini's growth achievements. Vini also did everything he could to praise him in the 2022 final. It is understandable why: because both of them came after three consecutive championships, and they encountered setbacks in the first season. They both suffered a lot of external attacks from the beginning because of personality and other non-football reasons. The Real Madrid players who suffered the most criticisms in the few years before the 22 championship were these two . So they understand each other's feeling the most, from the sluggish season after the three consecutive championships to the backbone/ace of the team and the Champions League triumph again, one of the best players in the world in this position. You can see the importance of their big heart and patience.\n\nI was also very emotional when watching the documentary. I have watched Vini, Courtois, and Benzema come and play for RM, and I have appreciated their talents from the beginning. Even when Courtois was still in Atletico, I thought he was the best goalkeeper in the world. And I watched VIni grow up all the way like Real's own child. I supported them and even fought for them countless times when they were questioned and criticized. Now I am very proud of it. I am more determined to continue to support them and other newcomers in the future. Real Madrid's success over the years is also due to its keen vision for these talents and its willingness to support and patiently invest. In fact, Vini's Real Madrid story is not even halfway through, let us wish him to create more glory in the future.",

I'm not familiar with his game and just started watching some highlights.\n\nI've noticed a few things:\n1. He's flipping tall for a left back\n2. Not really fast\n3. Seems better defensively than on offence\n4. Despite #3 he's like a diamond in the dirt and can polish that aspect.\n5. He seems calm on the ball, not overly in a hurry.\n\nDoes anyone watch Benfica enough to give more insight on his game? Tbh never heard of him until today.",
