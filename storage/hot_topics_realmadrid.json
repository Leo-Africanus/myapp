But obviously it didn't work well. After Ceballos pop up he seems to find his solution. Modric could also play the role.\n\nBut after Ceballos' injury he got only Modric to use. And he didn't trust Guler. In the first Arsenal game Modric seems to get muscled out in the 2nd half. And he tried to put Valverde in the middle again, but it didn't work. Vasquez became a weak spot again and caused the 3rd goal.\n\nThe La Liga game before the 2nd leg, Modric didn't start but he didn't start in the 2nd leg as well. I guess Carlo once again wanted to let Valverde to do the playmaker job but it failed horribly once again. We obviously lack of tempo and connection in the 1st half.\n\nI still think Carlo should have put more confidence in Guler, it's a bit too late now. ",

        "content": "No matter how you feel about Ancelotti, whether you were more \u201cCarlo in\u201d or \u201cCarlo out\u201d, the fact of our results, and playing style leading up to those results is just simply undeniable. Whether it was the manager that was completely to blame, whether it was the board or the players, that fact cannot be ignored. \n\nNow, personally, I was more Carlo out than in. I was fully aware of our board full of money hoarders, to the point where it feels our players\u2019 health has been negatively compromised by it, but there is no denying the lack of football identity from this team. You can say all you want about him not getting the pieces he wanted. That does not excuse what we\u2019ve been watching on the pitch for the past year. You can say it\u2019s the players, but it\u2019s literally been individual brilliance that has been bailing us out time and time again. If it\u2019s one or two players playing like headless chickens, sure. But when the whole team often looks like they don\u2019t even train together, there is really only one finger to point.\n\nI am more than grateful for Carlo. What he and the squad managed to do last season, achieving the double with only 1 loss, all while having key players like Courtois and Militao out was nothing short of exceptional. But the time has come. There is no need for us to get caught up in our sentimentality and act like he was never the issue (or at least part of it)\n\nEverything that\u2019s happening now is for the greater good.",

We need a metronome.\n\nMaybe Tchou can be the answer if he actually gets to play in the midfield a whole season. \n\nTo be fair we could also use a playmaker, but with the recent display of Arda Guler he might just be the answer for that. \n\nWe have a lot of pieces in the midfield, and maybe we don't need any signings in the midfield if Xabi can make it, but as this season has unfolded its hard to not se the need for at least a signing on the CM/CDM position.\n\nBut what do y'all think?\n\nBesides Nico Paz maybe coming home, I haven't heard any rumours of midfielders going to Real Madrid.

This is the key missing piece that has led to our horrendous season this year. It allows our fullbacks and midfielders to have less pressure defensively. There is a reason that we won 4 champions with Casemiro in that role and then 1 champions with Tchouameni there. Playing Tchouameni at center back was Carlo's mistake for he \"solved\" a problem which then opened up a bigger problem. Our attack became disconnected from our back line and we recovered less balls. Bellingham and Valverde were constantly scrambling to cover the fullbacks which left the middle of the field exposed forcing our centerbacks to press and get cooked. And when they cover the middle, our centerbacks are forced to support the fullbacks and they get cooked. \n\nWe win more duels up the field when Tchouam\u00e9ni is there. Just throw any random center back there and let Tchouameni cook. ",
