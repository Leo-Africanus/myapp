        "content": "   One of the biggest flaws of the team, even after so much success, has been the performance in the league. It is surprising how much Madrid struggles in the domestic competitions compared to the champions league. We drop points in games that should be easy, and it seems we lack endurance over a whole year. It got to the point where even Xavi managed to win a league over us. Which if you ask me, we should have won it. I obviously prefer winning a CL than the league. But why does Madrid struggle so much domestically?",
