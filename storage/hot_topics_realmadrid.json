I am not sure about his relationship with Carlo or others in the team. Haven't heard anything negative. Maybe a bit initially about his penalty disagreement with Vini. But that looks sorted now. \n\nSo, overall, what does this sub think about Mbappe? What can he do to get better, and what the club can do to bring the best out of him?\n\nEdit. Also, what do you guys think about his impact on the more important games? ",
