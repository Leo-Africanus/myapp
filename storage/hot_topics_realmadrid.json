He was never a perfect player, but his nonstop energy, vertical runs, and aggressive work rate on the right side gave the team a crucial extra dimension. With him, opponents had to respect that flank, stretching defenses and creating space for Vini and Mbapp\u00e9 to exploit. Without him, the entire right wing has gone dead, letting teams overload the left and simply lock onto our two superstars. The attack becomes predictable, the buildup stalls, and Madrid loses the balance and unpredictability that Franco\u2019s presence naturally provided.",

        "title": "Our midfield is too unbalanced and lacks technical ability",
        "content": "I've said something similar after the Olympiacos win and every single game the problem becomes more and more evident. We have too many midfielders with the exact same similar weaknesses: creativity from the back, passing and technical ability in general. We have too many \"physical\" midfielders, who aren't that amazing with the ball on their feet.\n\nThe weirdest part is that this team has been so used on playing with the best technical midfielders in the world: Kroos, Modric, Isco and before them, Ozil and Xabi himself. Nowadays apart from Arda, who's also struggling when sharing the pitch with Bellingham and he's getting pushed wider, none of our other (starting) midfielders can distribute the ball well, especially from the back. \n\nAgainst both Olympiacos and Girona we saw the same thing. Tchouameni receives the ball from the defenders, takes 5 touches and... 3 business days to do anything and once he's tighty marked, he does a simple sidepass that leads to more sidepasses, nothing or losing possession. Jude and Fede are nowhere to be found on these situations, so nobody can really collect the ball deep and start an attacking sequence. In the past, Casemiro also wasn't the best ball playing guy ever, but he was surrounded by two of the best passers ever. Now, nobody has these abilities. Camavinga was decent on both halves he played in the recent week defensively, although with the ball on his feet he has the exact same problems.\n\nWe basically need desperately a deep lying playmaker. Can Nico Paz play that role effectively? I'm not sure. Is there anyone else available on the market who is on RM level and won't cost a fortune? Again, not really sure. But until we get someone, even an inconsistent Ceballos might be very useful into balancing out this team. We also have to look into the Fede situation. The guy hasn't had a good performance in a while now.",

Dont get me wrong, he is a great talent but I feel like I\u2019ve been allowing him mistakes since he\u2019s been making up for it in assists and good passes. But it really does seem like he has a LOT to improve. His decision making has been subpar a lot of games. Unnecessarily passing to Mbappe, losing the ball to high presses. And recently I feel like its worsened. \n\nHe just seems lost a lot of the time like he doesnt know where to play. Xabi constantly changing the formation does not help either. The players need to learn and adapt to the system, and that takes time. How can they develop any chemistry like this?\n\nI get that Arda is a young player and these things will get better, but I feel like he should get some bench time. Maybe play Endrick on the right wing? Speaking of which, I have no idea what Endrick did to Xabi to just rot in the bench, it really seems like we could do something with him in that right side, especially when Franco\u2019s not available. Bellingham can play as a 10 instead of Arda, while Endrick can get into the box when Mbappe drops deep or to the left. ",

Even after winning, he looked kind of sad or distant on the bench. I\u2019ve also seen similar moments with Xabi Alonso rarely smiling, always looking tense.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m overthinking it, but it really made me realise how insanely difficult it must be to manage clubs like Real Madrid and Barcelona. The pressure is constant. Even Pep left Bar\u00e7a after so much success, and Zidane walked away after the three-peat. There are many other examples too.\n\nSo my question to Madrid fans:\nDo you also feel that managing these clubs drains coaches emotionally, even when the results are good?\nWould love to hear your thoughts.",
