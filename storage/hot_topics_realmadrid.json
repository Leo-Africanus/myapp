        "content": "Maybe it's too early to be excited, but today was a step in the right direction.\n\n\\- Playing the formation that best suits our existing set of players, and starting what I think is our strongest team.  \n\\- Focusing on making our front 2 dynamic rather than rigid. Instead of asking Mbappe to play as a typical 9, we allowed him and Vinicius to switch positions between LW and CF and even RW.  \n\\- Timely subs. Gave Rodrygo decent minutes IMO. It's the first time in a while I really felt he was given a reasonable chance as a sub.  \n\\- We also gave GG decent minutes as a Mbappe replacement. Something Xabi usually wouldn't do. After a MOTM performance and 2G+1A, there's no reason to leave Mbappe on the pitch when we can use those minutes to help GG stay sharp. Good call.\n\nThe only issue I have is with Brahim Diaz's introduction. I personally don't think he's worth the investment, and I think those minutes would be better spent on integrating Endrick into the squad. However it's only a slight inconvenience. I'll trust that Xabi knows better in this case.\n\nAlso, Vini &amp; Fede aren't playing great right now and need to get into form. It gets really scary for the rest of Europe when they get back to their best. Vini especially has earned enough trust to be given a bit of time, but pressure's on him to step up fast. If we continue to play this system, he'll have no excuse. I'm sure he'll deliver in no time, however. Things looked promising today.\n\nGoing forward, I think Xabi needs to work with the 4-4-2 and focus on improving fundamentals in and out of possession. This is what we were so excited that he would bring to the team. It's important to remember that we can play to our existing team's strengths while still improving their general play and understanding. There's no use trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Once those fundamentals are ingrained maybe we can try different formations to see if improvements are possible, but we should never be stuck on a formation or \"system\" if it doesn't improve our players, unless we plan to sign entirely new players to replace them.\n\nCourtois is the GOAT of course! And Mbappe looks so much better when he's given more freedom. In seasons where we have success, he'll definitely be our best player about 60% of the time. Brilliant player!  \n  \nHala Madrid! Celta Vigo next.",

        "content": "Still far from the top top level but its the right way forward with this current lot atleast. Now the sad part is, we won\u2019t see the same 11 for a long time too with trent out injured so here are some of the points:\n\n1. Now with trent out, what would your 11 look like? For me, id move fede back at RB since he is a ghost in midfield anyways but i have a feeling we\u2019ll play asencio there which could cost us against world class lw. As for midfield, guler is the obvious choice.\n\n2. Is guler going to drop to the bench? Dont get me wrong, he is great player but with how our current squad is shaped, guler just seems like a lost dog against big teams atleast. He needs to do a lot of work on his defense and transitions.\n\n3. Who is your starting cb duo? I love huijsen and i think he could be our future defensive leader but he still has a long way to go. For big games, we need a bully so for me, rudiger and militao is the way to go on big nights.\n\n4. Franco. Yes thats the question. I have been saying that he might be young but the chaos and energy he brings to the rw is something we missed for a long time and makes an impact. Id like to see him playing right mid in a diamond formation (should be bw him and guler rn)",

        "content": "Hi guys, I just wonder if MrXabi can play Jude in double pivot with tchouameni in the next match, cuz I think he will be more effective in helping the team in build up. he is also a good ball winner, and I saw him playing in this position wit Ozcan/Dahoud at BVB, and he was so good. Every time I see G\u00fcler dropping deep with Tchouameni while Jude plays higher in attack especially with Mbappe, Vini, and Mastantuono already there I feel it's a waste of Jude's and g\u00fcler's value",

I'm tired of seeing submissions that give 10s to Arda while rating Jude a 1 or vice versa, 10s for Mbappe and Vini even when it's clear they had a mid match, people giving 1s to every player if we lose a match, etc. Sorry to those who have enjoyed the surveys.",
