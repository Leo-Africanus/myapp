        "content": "Ok, so recently I've seen a bunch of tweets pushing Fede for the ballon dor which I'm all for tbh, I think he deserves it because like Rodri he is out most important player. However, earlier I saw post talking about Mbappe prop for the ballon dor. Now, this caught my attention because it reminded of last season. Last season Jude was on top of ballon dor shouts until the fanbase decided to jump onto Vini halfway. This ruined Jude's charge because the fanbase was split in part, so was the voting, and in the end a third party (Rodri) came through with full support. Now, this season unlike last season we don't have THE favorite, but we do have a favorite in Mbappe.\n\nNow, last season I was apart of the Vini train just because Vini is very sentimental to me because I got into the sport and became a madrid fan when he was just a meme (2019). So, seeing the fact I could watch him develop and now win a ballon dor just took me over. Now, this season Fede is also sentimental to me, but I don't want to make the same mistake. Would I want a Fede Dor, yes more than anything, but I don't wanna see the same mistake be made. I know twitter isn't everything, but majority of where PR goes on is Twitter and i guess Insta but I don't use Insta. \n\n In all honestly I believe we should stick to Mbappe, because he is basically our only player who has the media and the peoples backing. Valverde is one of the most underrated players itw, so that alone is hard to push him. But if we manage to push him, we don't have that Barcelona PR (Saying this legitimately, no troll, no immaturity, but it is evident) where we can support both players and still get them up there. We either focus on one, or the other, and my pick is Mbappe as he is the one with the best chance for us this season.\n\nI just wanted to see others opinions on this. I barely have any followers on Twitter so I took to here because otherwise I'd be talking to nobody lol.

        "content": "I've been wanting to hear opinion about Lucas that isn't a kneejerk reaction that comes off the back of a poor performance or a missed penalty (imagine the angry mob if we didn't make it past Atleti lol)\n\nMy case for Lucas\n\nFootballers aren't Swiss Army knives, not all of them anyways. Certainly not Lucas.  \nHe's our backup RB because once upon a time Carvajal was out injured and at the time we didn't have a backup RB (for the record, we still don't) so he was asked (or volunteered) to perform a role that isn't actually his. He did an okay/decent job back then, and sure some of us joke around calling him Lord Vazquez and Cafucas, but those names came from somewhere. In my mind, that can be considered some form of evidence that he performed well at some point.\n\nFast forward to today and his performances at RB have clearly taken a dip. That is undeniable. However, every time I see people calling for his head every game. None of this is on Lucas, it's on management. Every player that's played at RB over the last x number of seasons that is not named Dani Carvajal has *not* been an actual fullback; Lucas (not a fullback), Nacho (a versatile defender), Valverde (can do the job but is not a fullback), Asencio (versatile defender and really got a shot because of poor planning), Militao (CB).\n\nWhy is context thrown away every time his name comes up lately? You have a guy who is really one of the few options we have performing a role that isn't really his.  \nAgain, I'm not excusing his performances, they have been shaky at best. However he is a winger in a fullback costume and I judge him that way. The same way I would judge Rodrygo, for example, if he were playing at fullback.\n\nWhat am I missing here? Is the criticism *fair*? What are your thoughts?",

        "content": "I don't watch Castilla's matches, but I like to watch some highlights and videos to have a closer look at our gems. And honestly, Manuel Angel is the player that got my attention more than anyone else.\n\nHis playing style is kinda similar to Pedri.. his technique, vision, passes, dribbling skills.. very impressive.\n\nBut I know watching highlights isn't enough to judge a player. So if anyone here is watching RM Castilla, how good is Manuel Angel? I know he missed many matches this season due to injuries. Is he good enough to get promoted to the first team? ",

        "title": "Madrid has better chances to win this league than you think",
        "content": "We have already played against Betis and Villarreal, who are arguably the next two most challenging teams after Bilbao and Atleti with Barca still needing to face them. Barcelona continues to demonstrate their defensive vulnerability, and they have generally faced easier opponents in the new year, with Rayo Vallecano and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid being notable exceptions. Real Madrid is also regaining a more typical lineup, with the return of established defenders like R\u00fcdiger and Alaba at center back, and Tchouam\u00e9ni back in his natural position as a holding midfielder. Fran and Lucas have adapted well to the team's pace and are displaying strong defensive solidity. With Tchouam\u00e9ni anchoring the midfield, Bellingham is now free to play further forward, recreating the advantage he so effectively provided last season through his pressing, strength, aerial prowess, and ability to link up with Vin\u00edcius Jr. and Mbapp\u00e9. This configuration reduces pressure on our offense during attack generation and lessens concerns when plays break down, as the team's balance has been restored. Moreover, Valverde, Rodrygo, Brahim, and Camavinga act as the glue, covering overlapping runs, pressing, and producing moments of magic.\n\nMy only concern is the possibility of further injuries, but Ancelotti now has greater flexibility for substitutions with the return of Alaba and Camavinga. This allows him to rest players and maintain a solid defensive structure.  With a less demanding schedule while Mendy is out, we hope he can get the rest he needs and return stronger to help secure the league title. At the start of the year, despite being in first place, we had a defensively vulnerable team and relied heavily on Ceballos for defensive midfield presence. He performed phenomenally, but it required a larger defensive contribution from the whole team.  Importantly, during that period of vulnerability, Tchouam\u00e9ni was forced to play center back due to injuries. Now, with his return to holding midfield with Asencio being a trusted starter at center back, and Alaba's comeback from injury, we have much greater defensive stability in our natural position. Tchouam\u00e9ni also is much more experienced because he undertook an intensive course in defending while filling in at center back. The demands of defending are immense constant pressure and the need for unwavering focus, otherwise you concede or Courtois comes to the rescue. There will be more goals, better football, and lower blood pressure for us all. Hala Madrid!",
