The energy, the chants, the sea of Madridistas \u2014 it felt like being part of something way bigger than just a game. When the anthem played and the players walked out, I legit had goosebumps. \ud83e\udd0d\n\nAs for the game itself \u2014 intense, fast, and full of moments that reminded me why I fell in love with this team. The way we controlled possession, that modricismo midfield magic, and the passion on every tackle\u2026 you could feel the badge was heavy with pride. And of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a Real Madrid match without a bit of drama \ud83d\ude05\n\nWin or lose, I\u2019ll never forget this experience. For anyone who hasn\u2019t seen Madrid live yet: do it. It\u2019s more than football.\n\nHala Madrid y Nada M\u00e1s! \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udcaa",

That\u2019s why his current XI only includes players who have understood Xabi-ball best and adapted to it so far. Once this Club World Cup ends, players will get their vacations and rest. Then everything starts from scratch. Mbappe and Vinicius will return as permanent starters, and have the time and freedom in preseason and the new season to make mistakes, learn, and fully adapt to Xabi\u2019s system.   \n  \nThis is not about hierarchy or anyone being \u201cbenched\u201d permanently. It\u2019s simply because this is a MUST WIN knockout tournament where we can\u2019t afford out of sync players.\n\n",
