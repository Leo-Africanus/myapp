        "content": "#FT: H\u00c9RCULES 1:1 CASTILLA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#1\u00aa FEDERACI\u00d3N\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:** \n\n1:0 Oriol Soldevila 16'\n\n1:1 Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga 90'+4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - kickoff, vamos!  \n\n13' - great save by de Luis on a shot from outside the box, then Rivas clears it last second to prevent the rebound\n\n\u26bd 16' - goal for H\u00e9rcules, cross from the right side and with his back turned to our goal, Soldevila heads it on amazingly for it to go over de Luis and into the opposite corner \n\nHT - Castilla were under huge pressure at the beginning of the first half and deservingly conceded  the first goal. They slowly started improving throughout the half, although they didn't create enough danger yet\n\n46' - 2nd half underway \n\n\ud83d\udd04 58' - first sub, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga for Campos\n\n\ud83d\udd04 79' - Pol Fortuny and Jeremy for Manuel \u00c1ngel and Edgar\n\n\ud83d\udd04 89' - David Jim\u00e9nez has discomfort and Loren Aguado replaces him \n\n\u26bd 90'+4 - GOLLLL DEL CASTILLA - phenomenal cross by Yusi, who whips the ball in from the left touchline all the way onto Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga's head - he heads it past former Castilla player Abad in H\u00e9rcules' goal for the late equaliser! \n\nFT - Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga's equaliser in added time keeps Castilla's unbeaten run in 2025 alive - although it was now the 3rd draw in a row. The team was overwhelmed in the first half, committing easy errors in possession against H\u00e9rcules' press, and quickly conceded the 0:1. They tried to find solutions as they gained more and more control over the match, but failed to create danger for the most part until Yusi's brilliant cross found Loren's head. It wasn't a very convincing performance by Castilla, but even if it came late, the draw is the deserved result over 90 minutes \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 20:30 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Jos\u00e9 Rico P\u00e9rez, Alicante\n\n**Referee**: \n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 2, Matchday 28\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[FEF TV](https://feftv.com) (subscription - 12.99\u20ac/month)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (5-3-2): Mario de Luis - Youssef Enr\u00edquez \u2018Yusi\u2019, Edgar Pujol (79' Jeremy de Le\u00f3n), Jacobo Ram\u00f3n, Mario Rivas, David Jim\u00e9nez (89' Lorenzo Aguado) - Jos\u00e9 Maria Andr\u00e9s \u2018Chema\u2019, Manuel \u00c1ngel (79' Pol Fortuny), Andr\u00e9s Campos (58' Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga) - Gonzalo Garc\u00eda, V\u00edctor Mu\u00f1oz \n\nBench: Diego Pi\u00f1eiro (GK), David Ruiz, Antonio David, Borja Alonso.\n\nUnavailable: Fran Gonz\u00e1lez (first team call-up), Ra\u00fal Asencio (first team call-up), Quique Ribes (?), David Cuenca (pubalgia), C\u00e9sar Palacios (ACL tear). \n\nCoach: Ra\u00fal\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** WDWDD\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 7th | 38pt | 9-11-7 | 44:29\n",

One time there was even a beach ball thrown on the pitch when our player was going to take a corner. There were even some spectators who spat on Courtois as well as Mbappe. Even Llorente was about to kick the ball after failing at taking a penalty. It was good that Mbappe intervened but why was only Mbappe shown Yellow and why not Llorente since he was about to disrupt the game itself. After the match, the ugly tone and intimidation of Simeone at the post-match press conference asking Journalists to raise their hands if anyone thought if there's a double touch from Alvarez?? This is utter hooliganism from Atletico Staff &amp; Management, Atletico played at our stadium as well in first leg but we get to witness a good game without any fuss/nuisance. This aggressive behaviour from Atletico staff/management/spectators should be shunned immediately else its going to take a far more dark turn very soon.\n\nUEFA should've also sanctioned Atletico players, staff as well as spectators who indulged in all these ugly affairs the other day? What was that ambiguous statement from UEFA regarding penalty call, saying they'll discuss with FIFA/IFAB about removing the rules where touch was unintentional. How are they sure about that?",

        "content": "People are genuinely angry that he decided to show the 15 titles and told them to go home. What do you want him to do ? Cry or be ashamed? Gtfo with this he didn't play well and missed a penalty card. By that logic if you get lucky in your miserable life you're not allowed to celebrate because oh \"you didn't do well today \". I know who made my day every year for the last 3 years. Those screamers against sevilla man city that goal in the semis in the finals. Here's a man broken and hungry. I'll not turn on vini. Even if we went out last night, because this club is best represented not when we win but when we lose. I love all the players for having the balls to do shithousery at the same stadium which supported racist chants, threatened vini to never dance and gets teased by for not winning the \"balon'dor\". Our fanbase is used to success which I do not complain it is a thing of honour, but these fans are pampered. Let me tell you something very clear. Before we started winning these cl's from 2014-2024... We had won 3 in some last 50 years. Let that sink in for a moment. This guy gave us 2 of the greatest nights. I love you exactly for who you are vini. Never change but always get better \u2665\ufe0f",

If this rules is \"unfair\" &amp; \"doesnt make any sense\" Why never try to change it before atl vs real match? Is it really unfair? Or is it because the rules benefit real madrid? I'm 100% sure if Real Madrid player do double touch &amp; the goal get dissalowed, people would agree &amp; praise the ref. Sorry if my english is bad but i'm just trying to point out the MAD BIAS from these so called \"Pure &amp; Kind hearted\" Fanbase that would not stop talking about alvarez penalty. What about the handmall from simeone? The foul on rodrygo from 1st leg? Bomboclat! ",

        "content": "We always had this running gag of Perez always being 3 steps ahead. Well guess his master plan for this season was to make sure we have double agents (ex-madrid players) planted across Europe to sabotage their current teams.\n\nLast season, Kovacic steps up to take a pen and shoots it at Lunin's. Okay fine, Anyone can, miss. Man  then proceeds to come in as a sub and gifts us a goal at the Etihad to make it 3-2. This week, you got Llorente, who could've kept the tie alive but blasts it on the crossbar to send us through. Now ... I'm looking at you Martin Odegaard ... what do you have in store for us ?\n\nAnd if we get past Arsenal, rest assured, we already have sleeper agent ready to be activated. We'll either have Hakimi (PSG) or Marco Asencio (Aston Villa) prepped to drop the most dogshit performances to help their old club, yet again.\n\nAll roads lead to Munich. Perez been playing 5D chess the whole time, and none of us saw it coming. But it all making sense now.",
