The attitudes of the players will be telling as well. Regardless of the result if we see players not tracking back, not working hard, giving away the ball, that will be a massive let down and you can basically call that the end of our season. The fans will be up for it, the atmosphere will be great. I just hope that the players show some fight, not just for 10 or 15 minues, but for the entire game. Arsenal should not be working harder than us, I want to see us dominante the game completely. Even if we end up losing on aggregate, if we show fight, score, create many chances, that would go a long way. \n\nLet's get the job done. Hala Madrid!",

We didn't have the team and have looked lost tactically, and the first leg didn\u2019t help. Coming back against a team that\u2019s been so solid, so disciplined, feels like an impossible task.\n\nBut then again\u2026 how many times have they said it was impossible? How many times has this club proven that impossible is just another challenge?\n\nWe\u2019ve done it before - again and again. When no one believed, we did. When the odds were stacked, we rose. That\u2019s not luck. That\u2019s the spirit of Real Madrid.\n\nSo let\u2019s believe in the magic of the Bernab\u00e9u. Let\u2019s believe in our crest, in our team, in the moments that define this club. No, we don\u2019t have the same team we had last season. But we have this team. And we have us\u2014the fans who never stop dreaming.\n\nSo once more, let\u2019s dare to believe. Let\u2019s dream of another comeback. Because we are Real Madrid.

        "content": "Hola Madristas! \n\nAfter supporting this club for 15 years from afar, I\u2019m finally making the pilgrimage to Madrid! I\u2019ll be there on the 24th of May, and the final La Liga match is the only one I can attend during my trip. There\u2019s no way I want to miss it.\n\nI\u2019ve been checking secondary marketplaces like Viagogo, Seatpick, FootballTicketNet, etc., and Category 3 tickets are going for around \u20ac250. I know that\u2019s steep, but with the title race still open, I\u2019m worried prices might shoot up even more the closer we get.\n\nI\u2019ve also been keeping an eye on the official ticket site (Entradas), but I\u2019m unsure when or if tickets will drop there. Has anyone had luck getting tickets at retail from Entradas for big matches like this? When should I try? Is there a chance tickets become available closer to the match?\n\nAlso, is it worth gambling and trying to buy a ticket outside the stadium on matchday? I\u2019m scared of missing out completely, but I also don\u2019t want to overpay too early if there's a better option.\n\nAny help, experience, or advice would mean the world to me. This is a dream trip and I just want to make sure I\u2019m in the stadium for it!\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n",
