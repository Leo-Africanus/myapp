        "content": "I was thinking about Real Madrid\u2019s issues in the build-up phase without Modric and I remembered a player from the past who would be perfect for this team.\n\nI ended up watching this compilation (without the awful music) and it reminded me of how good Makelele was on the ball. \n\nPeople forget that Makelele came to Spain as a flying winger known for his skills and dribbling. \n\nObviously by the time he came to RM, he had to stay back so that the likes of Zidane, Figo, Guti and Raul had freedom in attack, but Makelele still had the ability to beat the press and carry the ball up the pitch. \n\nHe also had a very good eye for a pass between the lines (something that I think Camavinga has not developed yet). \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Makelele is now (incorrectly) viewed as this sort of unglamorous destroyer who just tackled strong, broke up the play and made a simple pass to the more creative players. \n\nNow I get that this idea had a lot to do with his time at Chelsea. Due to his age, he no longer had the legs to join the attack and Jose also instructed him to be lot more disciplined given how defensive Chelsea were. \n\nBut there\u2019s still this idea that Makelele was a limited player even though he had very good technique and passing ability.\n\nWhat do you the Madridistas think?\n\n",

It's decently clear that Xabi will largely be playing with a 3 at the back with a deep lying playmaker role for a defensive midfielder. He's already tried Guler there but it's evident he lacks defensive awareness and physicality. As for Mastantuono, he's more of an attacking midfielder again not much on the defensive side.\n\nIs there any chance we might go for him after the CWC? Do you folks feel he'll be a worthy addition to the current team and setup?",

Endrick or Gonzalo? Because there are rumours of Endrick leaving on loan and Gonzalo staying.\nAnd if Rodrygo leaves than the number 11 will be vacant, who takes it? Franco, Arda, Brahim?",

        "content": "It's certain that Rodrygo will be leaving, which is kind of sad. The club has stated that if a player departs, they will sign a new player . I believe we will most likely look for a center-back since Rudiger is much better positioned as a center center-back. Tchouameni is also essential in midfield, as we saw in the last match against Juventus. \n\nSo, the question is: who does Real Madrid actually need? There are currently two world-class options available. Bastoni, a left-footed player from Inter, has excellent ball-playing ability and could take on a role similar to Hincapie's role . Dean would be moved to the right flank, where he typically plays in Spain. With Rudiger as the center center-back, we could have a more composed backline. He might be a feasible option now, especially since Inter is struggling financially. The next target is ibrahima konate which is most likely option   a right footed center back  a fast no nonsense defender  and he also put on a great display against vini jr with him we could see him on the right flank dean would stay where he is rn so yeah let me know your opinion on that \n\nI forgot mention konate has also refused to sign a new deal at liverpool his contract is expiring next season \n\n\nStop down voting me please I litterly have a new account thank you ",

        "content": "I don\u2019t want to overflog the issue but the fact that the goal against Juve last time came from a combo of two players who were not in the team last season is something really positive about the summer transfer and coach\u2019s attitude. \n\nKinda sums up why we so much struggle to create goal scoring chances when we play against low blocks or teams that are able to contain our left side. \n\nI\u2019m happy we paid Liverpool to allow us have Trent for the CWC.",
