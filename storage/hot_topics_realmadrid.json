        "content": "**Real Madrid**\u00a0has taken a firm stance regarding the future of\u00a0**Arda G\u00fcler**, their young Turkish prospect. According to\u00a0*Defensa Central*, the club turned down a \u20ac50 million offer for the talented midfielder this summer, making it clear that their commitment to him is long-term.\n\nInterest in\u00a0**G\u00fcler**\u00a0is unsurprising given his noticeable growth in performance and development compared to last season. The player\u2019s physical and technical improvements have caught the attention of\u00a0**Xabi Alonso**, who fully trusts that G\u00fcler will be a key figure throughout the campaign.\n\nSources close to the club say the decision to reject such a high amount reflects not only\u00a0**G\u00fcler**\u2019s football potential but also the belief that his market value could rise even further if he continues on this upward trajectory. Within the squad, there is a strong conviction that the midfielder could become one of the team\u2019s mainstays in the near future.\n\n\n\n# \n\n",

        "content": "First off sorry for the quality of this video, couldn't get it downloaded in a better quality.\n\nI felt like sharing a piece of my story and the relationship I have with this goal. In early 2024 I had one of my worst if not the worst periods in my life. I felt like a piece of garbage back then, still not over my ex, not confident in myself. I was seriously considering ending it all, feeling like I couldn't be loved and that nothing could ever bring me joy. In those difficult moments, I couldn't find happiness in anything besides football, more specifically: Real Madrid.\n\nI've been a supporter for almost 11 years at that time. The 23/24 season was going great, almost like Los Blancos wanted me to keep going. Only one loss, great La Liga campaign, and promising UCL performances made waiting for thier games a nightmare. In January I was at my lowest, crying myself to sleep almost every night, feeling disturbed and upset all the time. But as always up to that point in the season I had time to watch Real in the evening. Supercopa might not sound like that much but at that moment every match they played was like a sweet relief for me, a break from cruel reality. And that's what brings me here, to this match and this goal.\n\nReal Madrid vs Atletico Madrid in the supercopa semifinal was a rolercoaster of emotions, going behind early to taking the lead through Ferland Mendy, to Kepa's mistakes that, for a while looked, to be the final blow for us as Atletico went 3-2 up. At that point I didn't really think of it that much, but from the perspective of time, this scoreline could've be my end as another bigger break from Real Madrid matches, the only thing that made me happy, was a giant blow for my already bad attitude.\n\nThen Carvajal scored... just take a look at the video (and yes the polish commentary is also quite sentimental for me). I was overjoyed. Goal scored by team, goal scored by determination. It's poetic for me.\n\nOf course we went on to win this match (through Carvajals cross may I add) and secured the title later that week. It was the first happy moment in weeks for me.\n\nNow over a year and a half later, I'm happy again, I love my life, I love my family and my friends. It's incredible that a spanish right-back putting the ball in the back of the net may have kept me going. Thank you Carvajal, thank you Real Madrid. \n\nPlease check on your friends, family members, mutuals and most importantly yourself. Speak to professionals if you need help. I was lucky enough for a well disposed team to save my life, but it might not be enough for others. Take care and Hala Madrid!",

He might actually have put a good impression on Xabi. \n\nMaybe Xabi can elevate Beahim to the next level. He clearly has the talent. \n\n  \nRegardless, lets hope for a wonderful season",
