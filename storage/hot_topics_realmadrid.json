Courtois was rotating with Navas in 18-19 but started more games than both.\n\nCourtois is super solid and got the guts to encourage/yell at the team. Nor do we see him having beef with any RM coaches. I have been big fan of him since his ATM years, you can rewatch the 13-14 final, he made many good saves and forced a 92:48 miracle.",

It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s doing everything to become the villain in the fans\u2019 eyes.\n\nI\u2019m not taking sides here, just pointing out how quickly someone can become their own worst enemy in the public eye. You can go from hero to scapegoat in one season if you stop being the player the crowd wants you to be. And that shift often has nothing to do with form, and everything to do with perception.  \n",

        "title": "Perez needs to just focus on business and let others handle the football side of things",
        "content": "Looking back I think the most success we have had was when Perez was forced to let go of control of footballing decisions.\n\nFirst it was because we were in desperate situation always loosing to barca. So perez signed Jose Mou. Mou signed on the condition of complete control over everything football related, from signings to fitness team. He even fired the sporting director and hired Zidane. This is when the rebuilding started. The players we bought were in no way galacticos, they were more like carreras, players with great potential. He signed Di Maria, Ozil and Khedira among others. All 3 were key. We won La Liga with record points in history of La Liga and record goals too (records that still holds btw). We also managed to reach UCL semifinals 3 years in a row, getting knocked out of penalties in one of them and away goals in one of them. In his first year we beat the invincible barca to win copa del rey too.\n\nI think the UCL we won with ancelloti was because of the core that mou built plus some great reinforcements like bale and isco, and also ancelloti magic touch to heal the locker room.\n\nThen we had Zidane who carried on from that same core. And he had so much control just because of the mere fact that he was Zidane, the aura he had. Also we already had great squad at that point so signing wise not many more decisions were to be made, but on pitch decisions were completely left to zidane. He had the balls to bench Bale even though he was loved by perez. He also had balls to bench James, a player with massive shirt sale potential. If perez had control, he would never allow casemiro to start over james rodriguez, or isco to start over bale.\n\nAfter that we won UCL again when Perez, even though he didn't liked the idea, actually listened to what Ancelloti wanted and got him Joselu, who was very important for that season.\n\nWhy hire xabi when he wanted the players to have all the power ? why sell both kroos and modric and not replace them ? Why not let modric stay one more season ? why not sign zubimendi ?",
