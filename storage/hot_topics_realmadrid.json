        "content": "He fits the club\u2019s policy to sign young and up and coming players. He\u2019s already a big big player in the premier league which is one of the most difficult/physical in the world, especially as a CB. As expected a host of big clubs have already courted him. Also, dont get why people say \u201ches unproven\u201d. When you play week in week out for such a good side and get called up for spain and is the starting cb, idk how much more proven you can find at his age. Secondly, the boy is a Madrid fan. He seemingly loves madrid and his fav is our very own Ramos. Finally, his price. I know his release clause of 50m is a bit steep and madrid has refrained for going for high cost players lately but the fact that they dont have to outbid any clubs and the player himself is willing to join makes everything so much more straightforward. I say get the guy in",

Vitinha and Fabian Ruiz were wonderful but I truly believe Joao Neves is the heart of success between the 3. \n\nIn my opinion, Cama has a similar game to Neves. Great presser, ball caring, and \u201cdestroyer\u201d in the midfield while also having a taller frame and more pace than Neves. Cama is truly amazing to watch on his day, so what exactly is holding him back from taking the next step to becoming a solidified world class CM?",

GA tickets only come on sale a week before and I would want to get 5 of them.  Would I need to buy a membership to buy the tickets, or wait in a queue?

        "content": "Yes, football has a way of humbling the arrogant. We\u2019ve experienced it ourselves this season. While we know we have incredible players like Rodrygo, Mbapp\u00e9, and Vini, and their talent can light up any game, overconfidence has a way of backfiring. This is something Barcelona fans have also dealt with, it even reflected in their players\u2019 comments.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t call me arrogant when I keep winning.\u201d Yet, football has proven time and again that such thinking can lead to unexpected outcomes. For example, Inter is often dismissed as \u201cjust a defensive team that sits back,\u201d but underestimating them is a dangerous mistake. The same overconfidence struck AC Milan in 2007 when they thought they were above Liverpool before the Champions League final. They were humbled in the most memorable way.\n\nFor us to maintain our consistency as a team, it\u2019s essential that our players respect the game, their opponents, and the effort required to succeed. I hope next season, they approach every match with 100% effort and avoid falling into the trap of overconfidence.\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who pointed out that Milan actually won in 2007. I was referring to the 2005 final.",
