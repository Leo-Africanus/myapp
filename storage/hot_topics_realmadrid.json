Do you absolve him of all mentality criticisms of he shows this extreme display of loyalty? \nEDIT: many are saying it\u2019s $1B across 5 years, point still stands though plus he is getting offers for $350M/year.

I know he scored that insane Copa del Rey goal vs Barcelona and the bicycle kick in the UCL final, but I want to know more. What was Bale like in his prime? How important was he to the team when Ronaldo was around? Did injuries really hold him back that much, or was he underrated overall?

        "content": "I didn't grow up watching Iker Casillas live, and I never had the chance to see him during his peak years. As a younger Real Madrid fan, I\u2019ve only seen highlights and heard about his legendary status. I know he won everything\u2014Champions Leagues, La Liga titles, the World Cup, and Euros with Spain\u2014but what made him truly special? Was it his reflexes, leadership, or big-game mentality? I\u2019d love to hear from fans who watched him play regularly. What moments or matches defined him for you? Where does he rank among all-time great goalkeepers? I\u2019m trying to understand why so many people call him \u201cSan Iker.\u201d Your stories and opinions would mean a lot.",
