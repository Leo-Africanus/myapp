First, looks like I was right to say Misa should flee, here even in CL, Pau has no interest in playing her. I assume maybe our \"captain\" will get to play a Copa Del la Reina match if she's lucky.\n\nSecond, the Antonia injury was as bad as the stretcher made it look. No timeline on her return, but it is more serious than they thought.\n\nI hope we have a good performance tonight, we have some tough opponents so hitting the ground running is a must. I just wonder what it will take for me to come round to Pau's way of coaching. ",

        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/li0l9u4pcrtf1.png?width=651&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51ceb45fb5af9200b761de16e2ccc114572dbaeb\n\n**My reasoning:**\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Valverde on the right wing** \u2014 instead of Franco, to exploit Bar\u00e7a\u2019s high line with his pace and work rate. We\u2019ve seen recently that they struggle against runners in behind. Franco tends to slow the game down and take extra touches, while Valverde keeps the tempo fast and direct \u2014 exactly what we need.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **G\u00fcler as the 10** \u2014 his ability to break lines and pick out runners will be vital. He can feed Mbapp\u00e9 and the wingers effortlessly, giving us creativity through the center.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Double pivot of Jude and Camavinga** \u2014 technically excellent and press-resistant, crucial against Bar\u00e7a\u2019s aggressive midfield press. Tchouam\u00e9ni could struggle under that intensity, but Jude and Cama complement each other well and both are strong in interceptions and tackles.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Trent\u2019s inclusion is key** \u2014 if available, his passing range could be a real weapon against Bar\u00e7a\u2019s high defensive line. With Militao, Camavinga, and Fede around him, his defensive weaknesses can be covered while maximizing his distribution.\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 **Ball-playing defenders and midfielders** \u2014 every player from the backline to midfield can progress the ball well, which will be huge in bypassing Bar\u00e7a\u2019s press and launching quick transitions.\n\n6\ufe0f\u20e3 **Impact subs:** Rodrygo and Franco can come on against tired legs to add fresh energy and unpredictability.\n\n7\ufe0f\u20e3 **If we need defensive solidity**, Carvajal and Tchouam\u00e9ni can be introduced in the second half.\n\n8\ufe0f\u20e3 **My only concern is Camavinga** \u2014 he\u2019ll need to play smart and disciplined. If he rushes into duels or loses positional sense, it could backfire. But if he keeps his composure, this setup could genuinely dominate the midfield battle.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

        "content": "In an interview with Diario AS, Rodrygo has confirmed that this was down to his mental health.\n\n:\n\n\"The truth is, I had a very difficult time on a personal level. I went a long time without speaking to anyone. No one knew what I was going through. It was a very difficult time. I wasn't well, either physically or mentally. That was really hard for me. First God, then my family... and Coach Ancelotti helped me get through all that. Carlo helped me a lot. He saw every day that I wasn't well, that I wasn't fit to play, that I couldn't help the team.\"\n\n\"But there was no time to recover because we played every three days, and then you can't stop to solve the problem. He saw that I'm a person and I had real problems. He understood my moment and my complicated situation. He told me: 'Just stay here calmly, you're not fit to play now.' I thanked him and asked to play. But he knew he had to recover the person before the player.\"\n\n\"The important thing was to be in good shape. It was a very difficult time in my life, but now I've overcome everything, I'm okay. Whenever I can, I thank Carletto, his son Davide, and the coaching staff. Everyone helped me, and of course my family. Now I feel nothing but joy, I'm happy, and very motivated to have a great season.\"",
