I want to surprise my boyfriend (life long Real Madrid fan) with tickets to the Real Madrid : Atletico Madrid match in February as it coincides with his birthday and he's never seen them in person.\n\nWhat are even the chances of getting these tickets ahead of time online as it's a big match. And my other question is - are VIP tickets worth it? I am contemplating getting VIPs,  if they are available earlier than regular tickets as I also have to organise plane tickets and a hotel as we have to fly in from a different country. I also paid some premium membership (35 EUR/year) type of a deal on the official website as it was quite cheap and they advertised one of the perks was earlier or easier access to tickets? What are your experiences with this?\n\nThank you so much for all the help and answers and sorry if this is not the right place for this kind of a post.\n\nX",

        "content": "Liverpool is by far the best team itw at the moment. They are at top of premiere league  by a pretty decent margin, unbeaten in champions league and doing really well in their domestic competitions too.\n\nHistorically we have always owned liverpool in ucl knockout matches, but this time they kinda seem invicible. We are improving no doubt, especially our attack with mbappe coming back in form and rodrygo putting up incredible numbers since coming back from his injury but our defense is still shit. Like even vs sevilla when there was literally no pressure on us, we missed so many chances and conceded 2 goals which should have not been let in at any cost and was completely the defense's fault. This has been however over-shadowed bcz our rivals mainly barca are playing like shit so we are still in contention of la liga.\n\nYes we have clutched up in champions league before, but I am not sure how long we can depend on these last minute goals... I feel we need to play asencio and let him develop. I have no idea why Carlo is benching him. We need to bench vazquez and buy another right back. And please give some time to Arda and Endrick. Like even versus sevilla when we were winning easily still carlo made mbappe, rodrygo and fede play almost the entire game instead of substituting them. This is quite risky given how many injuries we are going through this season.\n\nWhat's your opinion on this??",
