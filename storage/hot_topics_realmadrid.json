It was obvious that Carreras was expecting to join us before the tournament started and it didn\u2019t sit well with him at all because the first two games he played, you can clearly see that he didn\u2019t want to play for them anymore. I can understand why would back out last minute because he\u2019s one of their best players this season and you wouldn\u2019t want to go in to a tournament without your best guys. What confuses me, is the fact he didn\u2019t play a single minute today knowing that this was a must win match and you need your best starting eleven. This just seems like pettiness me honestly; and if that\u2019s the case why didn\u2019t you let him come to us in the first place. What do you guys think",
