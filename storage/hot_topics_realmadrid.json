        "title": "Xabi's biggest challenge will be to bring back that DOG mentality we were so renowned for.",
        "content": "Tactically, I'm not worried one bit. Looking at PSG as an example, this is the same PSG which finished 15th, losing to Atletico, Bayern, Arsenal, drawing to fucking PSV. They were sitting below 24th spot a some point even. Fast forward to now, they are the best collective in the world, destroying teams left right and center. So, for us, it might take some time obviously, for Xabi to try things. Some might fail, we might even need a few more signings, but eventually, Xabi will have this team playing exactly the way he wants and it will be amazing. \n\nBut to me, his biggest challenge will be to bring us back to being the mentality monsters we were always praised for in the last 10 years or so. Last season up till now, this team seems absolutely lost the moment we concede 2 goals. Barcelona, Arsenal, PSG, etc, like clockwork. And it's not a Carlo thing, since the '22 was literally won on the backs of remontadas and '24 we were the most solid team in Europe with 2 losses all season. And it's not like we bought a fresh new team either, most of the guys who were there then, but n ow, they seem to almost click off the moment we go 2 goal down.\n\nThis is the thing Mourinho managed to instill in our squad from 2010 to 2013. That \"Never say die\" spirit. Which was then carried on by our core players, CR7, Benz, Modric, Kroos, Case, Carvajal. We might not win the game, but we'll make sure the team suffers and holds on for dear life until the final whistle. When a team took a 1-2 goal advantage, people would say they were lucky Madrid didn't comeback. Now, the moment we concede twice, might as well turn off the TV cause the rest of the game is gonna consist of us trying to survive not conceding more instead trying an actual comeback.\n\nI don't know how we went from mentality monsters for a decade straight, to wtv this garbage is right now in the span of a single year. We practically switched places with Barcelona at this point, cause the past season they managed to reverse god knows how many 2 goal deficits, including against us.\n\nWhat people called \"individual brilliance\" was actually not quite that. Just a collective understanding from a group of elite players telling each other \"WE'RE NOT LOSING TODAY, SO WE FIGHT TILL THE END, TOGETHER\". So yes, in my opinion, this will be the biggest challenge and probably the one which will determine if Xabi wins major trophies for us or not. Cause yes, there will be games where things go sideways. But what always made us special was the fact we ALWAYS reacted and put up one hell of a fight, till the final whistle. ",

        "content": "People seriously need to calm down about this loss.\n\nYes, losing 4-0 to PSG hurts, but the overreactions are getting out of control. I\u2019ve seen people say Mbapp\u00e9 is the worst signing we\u2019ve made in the last years. Really? The same Mbapp\u00e9 who\u2019s had a goal or assist in every final since he joined? The same player who was basically carrying us in every El Cl\u00e1sico? Without him, some of those games would\u2019ve looked like 4-0 or 5-1 defeats. Even against City in the second leg, he was the only one who showed up and scored.\n\nAnd now people are turning on Arda G\u00fcler too, saying he can\u2019t start against top teams. This guy started five games during the Club World Cup and looked sharp. In this PSG game, he was thrown into a midfield where he was completely isolated. Bellingham couldn\u2019t do much either, and Valverde was played as a right-back. What exactly was G\u00fcler supposed to do?\n\nSame with Gonzalo Garc\u00eda. He played against arguably the best team in the world right now, in a side that\u2019s still finding itself. And people are already calling him not good enough? It\u2019s been a handful of games.\n\nThen there\u2019s Tchouam\u00e9ni. Suddenly he \u201ccan\u2019t perform against top teams\u201d? That makes no sense. The real issue wasn\u2019t the midfield or the attack \u2014 it was the defense. All four defenders had an off-day. Simple as that. We conceded goals through errors you\u2019d expect from Sunday league players.\n\nXabi Alonso\u2019s only been working with this squad for five games. Five. He was basically using last season\u2019s team, without his new signings. What exactly are people expecting? Miracles?\n\nThis is the best PSG team ever. This club is in their prime. No one\u2019s been able to touch them. And yet some fans are acting like this one result erases everything we\u2019ve done and all the potential this team still has.",

        "content": "Yesterday\u2019s 4-0 defeat to PSG was painful, no doubt. But honestly I think this loss might actually help us in the long run.\n\nThis game clearly exposed some of our weak spots  especially in defense and up front. I hope this pushes the club to fully utilize the transfer window. We need proper reinforcements not just backups, but solid starters.\n\nYes, we\u2019ve got Vini and Mbapp\u00e9, but let's be real: they\u2019re not center-forwards. They thrive as wingers. Sure, Mbapp\u00e9 scored tons last season, but when did those goals come? Against who? When it mattered most  vs Liverpool,  Arsenal, and nowPSG  he went missing.\n\nDid you notice yesterday how PSG\u2019s attackers pressed our keeper and center-backs constantly? Meanwhile, our front three were waiting for quick counters  but to counter, you need the ball first. PSG controlled possession and suffocated our build-up.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about blaming individuals. The CB error? It happens. But the overall system looked off  (not xabi's fault) and that\u2019s why I\u2019m hoping the club realizes we need a true striker, more depth in defense, and maybe a few others with the hunger to fight in games like these.\n\nJust my take. I know some may disagree  and that\u2019s totally fair. I just love this club and want us to improve from here.\n\nHala Madrid. \ud83e\udd0d",

        "content": "There's absolutely NO excuse for vini and mbappe to be losing the ball and then leaving the rest of the team to fend for themselves and just hope that they win it back and pass it to them for a counter attack. Mbappe is literally the FASTEST man on the pitch, if he was to track back and recover the ball after losing it, things would be perfect. This attitude from both of them is genuinely unbelievable to me, it literally makes no sense,they can't keep doing this. Also vini does actually defend sometimes but he's not consistent with it so I don't care anymore",

He has La Liga experience from his days at Real Sociedad, and he can play multiple roles in attack. Despite his height, he is very good on the ball, and his passing is highly underrated. It would be challenging to fit him into the current squad, but with potential future outgoings, who knows?",

        "content": "First, I am not happy about the result, but everyone needs to calm down. Pundits included. The fact that people are calling for everything to get thrown away is mind numbingly crazy. \n\nHere are the facts, PSG just came off a DOMINANT UCL run. RM implemented a new coach and System last month. Does RM have world class players yes, absolutely. Does RM need to do better? ABSOLUTELY!!! But idk can we see what the team looks like after 1 month? Can we see what they look like with players that actually play the position they are in? \n\nHere is what we know, Mbappe got his first start in the new system against the best team in the world. The young players (Garcia, Asensio, Arda) finally had growing pains against Prime competition and showed their age. Fede is a top 3 player itw as a CM, but maybe he shouldn\u2019t be playing against the best front 3 as a RB. 2 mistakes in the first 7 minutes changed the game immensely. Also, RM was missing key players, but players that were coming off major injuries, showed their class.\n\nTranquilo, RM are coming, and anyone who doubts that needs to go watch baseball.",
