What was his form? From what I\u2019m gathering, we do not expect him to be part of first team setup for next season. Maybe he\u2019ll play for Castilla for a year, since he\u2019s still 17. \n\n\nI have high hopes for him to be a great Real Madrid player, and appreciate any insight you guys might have.\n\nCheers!",

But for those unfortunate enough, I want to say what a privilege it was seeing him clutching so many big games. Finals and big ucl matches against goat sides of any kind were customary when he was around. When we faced one of the best juventus teams ever, this man came out on to the pitch with a full night of sleep and slayed them in 40 minutes. It was an honour to witness his prime.",

He really reminds me of James, Amazing at passing the ball and taking shots with his left foot.\n\nMy issue is that he is not pacey enough like a traditional winger. He does not have the pace like Rodrygo, Vini or Mbappe to play on the wings. He is slower than Guler aswell, \n\nI think Guler has the potential to be an amazing CM like Modric. \n\nWill Franco Mastantuono transition to a cm aswell? ",
