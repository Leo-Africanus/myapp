Carletto is one of the most impactful coaches for RM ever. Last season was a stinker, and he carries responsibility for that. But let\u2019s not put dirt on our own.\n\nIn before people react to this with \u201ccriticism should be possible\u201d: yes, absolutely, but do it respectfully. There\u2019s simply no way Ancelotti is some clueless fool that was lucky enough to win more CL titles than any other manager ever.",

        "title": "La Liga: The Most \u201cElite\u201d Amateur League in the World",
        "content": "Honestly, how does La Liga still market itself as one of the top leagues in the world when every week there's another scandal?\n\n**Referee scandals everywhere** \u2013 First the Negreira case, where Barcelona paid a former referees\u2019 official for \u201cconsulting\u201d over years. And the story of a ref whose company allegedly had business ties with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, or another ref who had a painting of Messi on his garden wall. And of course, there\u2019s supposedly no conflict of interest, and the fact that these refs keep making the most questionable decisions against Madrid is just a coincidence. And those were just two of the bigger scandals from last season that involved Real Madrid. Every single week there are smaller controversies \u2014 and bigger ones affecting other teams too \u2014 with absolutely no sign of things improving anytime soon.\n\n**No goal-line technology in 2025** \u2013 Every other major league solved this problem a decade ago. Meanwhile in Spain, you\u2019re still relying on VAR guesswork and dodgy camera angles to decide if a ball crossed the line in billion-euro competitions.\n\n**Offside tech behind the times** \u2013 The Premier League uses thicker lines to account for the 2\u20135 cm margin of error in frame rates and calibration. La Liga? Paper-thin lines and decisions made down to a single pixel, even though the technology itself admits it isn\u2019t that precise. Just look at Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s goal in the last match \u2014 it was clearly onside. How can anyone in this league seriously rule a player offside by 1 mm when experts agree the system has a 2\u20135 cm error margin?\n\n**And sometimes, VAR just\u2026 \"doesn\u2019t work\"** - Somehow, in 2025, there are still games where VAR goes completely offline for \"technical reasons\", leaving clubs in billion-euro competitions at the mercy of human error like it\u2019s 1995.\n\n**Home advantage? Let\u2019s sell it to the US** \u2013 Instead of fixing officiating or infrastructure, La Liga wants to stage league games in the United States, stripping smaller clubs of one of the only equalizers they have: home turf advantage.\n\n**Then there\u2019s the racism** - Week after week, Black players \u2014 especially stars like Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior \u2014 face racist abuse from the stands, and the response from the league is embarrassingly weak. No other top-five league even comes close to this level of repeated incidents with so little action taken.\n\nCorruption scandals, outdated technology, decisions made with zero regard for sporting fairness, racism, and bizarre scheduling issues \u2014 this league needs a complete overhaul before it can even be called professional. But Tebas seems to care more about money than about \u201cunnecessary\u201d things like fairness and integrity.\n\n**\"This isn\u2019t football. This is La Liga.\"**\n\n\n*Edit: I\u2019ve added the racism issue as well. Sorry for forgetting this other unique feature of La Liga.*",

From Di St\u00e9fano to Ra\u00fal, from Ronaldo to Benzema, and now to the likes of Bellingham and Vin\u00edcius\u2014it feels like every generation gets its own heroes, but the winning mentality never changes.\n\nThis club has a way of turning impossible into possible, heartbreak into glory, doubt into dominance.

        "content": "When Bellingham returns, I think our midfield balance needs adjusting. If we play with 3 midfielders, we shouldn\u2019t start both Valverde and Tchouam\u00e9ni together since neither is very comfortable on the ball. Instead, we should pair Bellingham and Arda G\u00fcler for control and creativity, with either Valverde or Tchouam\u00e9ni alongside them for ball-winning. Bellingham should play as a CM, while G\u00fcler plays higher up as the AM to avoid being bullied physically deeper. This setup gives us both ball control and defensive stability. However, if we go with a 4-man diamond, then both Valverde and Tchouam\u00e9ni can fit in",

        "content": "After our back to back wins, i have been thinking about our lineup after bellingham comes back from the injuries. Ideally, i think the best lineup we would have at our disposal is the current defense, midfield of tchoumeni, valverde and Arda and an attack of Bellingham, Mbappe and Vini. I think that playing Bellingham in the central role would be perfect for our team to utilize those dangerous crosses from Trent(we don't have any attackers in the box when we cross) . Also, bellingham can play as a CM when arda or valverde is pushing high. Mbappe being Mbappe will thrive on either side of the wing and we also know what vinicius is capable of when he is in form . Also when we play a high pressing team , we can switch Arda for Ceballos as the closet player we have that is press resistant and control the tempo is him.  There are so many qualities and depth right now in our team I fear there will be problems in the dressing room due to the lack of playing time once everyone is fit. What do you guys think?",

        "content": "This post isn't to shit on Ancelotti, he was a fantastic manager for us and helped stabilize the cup and brought plenty of silverware and I will forever be grateful for that.\n\nWhat I will say is this season even though its obvious the team is still adapting to Xabi's instructions and playstyle and with the a lot of new additions to the team, it feels like for the first time in a long time, I am enjoying watching realmadrid actually play again. \n\nFor a long time it felt like I was watching because I had to watch it and there was no inspiration watching the team play and the only thing that mattered was the end result and while the results are truly the most important thing, as fans that is not what inspires us to start supporting the team and become lifelong fans.\n\nI want to sit down and watch a madrid game with excitement, expectations and enjoyment and I think Xabi is bringing that back slowly. The little intricate plays in tight spaces, the runs, the passing, movement and swagger this club has been known for feels like it's coming back and that was show in the marcelo like passing from Trent, the Ronaldo like chop from Vini and the ramos esque passing from Dean. \n\nThe results are obviously vital and very important but I urge the fanbase to give Xabi and the players time, let them cook and to support them when they eventually struggle but I believe sooner rather than later we will become a dominant force again.\n\nHala Madrid!",
