        "title": "I think the diamond midfield could be the way to go whenever facing a low block like Osasuna. Or worst case, Arsenal/Atleti",
        "content": "\nLet me explain, One glaring problem I noticed against Osasuna is how useless trent x Brahim was. Brahim isn't good enough and  against a low block, Trents best method of delivering crosses, was utterly useless as the box had just one of our players in at the maximum.\n\nAlso, in this formation Ideally I would have Bellingham at at the top of the diamond with CVT as the supporting cast. In the current situation, My pick would be Gonzalo for that AM position and of course Arda as that LCM. Vini and K10 would be the front two.  \n\nWhy think this would be particularly useful against low blocks is because as there are no actual wingers, the full backs primarily occupy the flanks and are in pole crossing position. Now, the reason I chose Gonzalo at head of the diamond as a replacement to Jude is because of their competence in the air.  Whenever the full backs are in crossing position, Gonzalo is in prime position to make a run in for a high cross. Now, a cross doesn't necessarily have to be a high cross. This is where Arda and Valverde come in. One trait of Fede that I've seen become rarely utilised is his runs into the box, a well executed to through ball to Fede near the edge of the box or even inside it makes it the perfect opportunity for him to deliver a powerful low cross with 3 forwards to connect. Arda is excellent at picking out players from the vicinity of the box and with Gonzalo being a genuine goal threat along side Vini, that is also a good opportunity for him to initiate the movement of the ball through the middle if the fullbacks are being closed down tighter. Valverde is the wildcard in this setup here, as he can get often overlooked even though he is a good shooter. Vini and Mbappe are not good arially but that doesn't mean they're threats when it comes to crosses, which is why cross and inshallah would not be a bad option. Also this drags defenders away from Valverde and Arda who are good shooters themselves.\n\n\nAlso another part of this I want to mention is that when defending Valverde stays wide and possibly high considering how strong the opponent left side attack is. He's a strong and Fast player who will assist better in counter attacks. But then again Fede is often someone that can handle a more defensive role while still being quick enough to be part of the counter\n\n\nWhat do you guys think about it?",

I have been looking into tickets but I'm a bit confused by their website and the process of purchasing. I am wondering if anyone here has purchased tickets through their official website or through a second part vendor and how that process went.\n\nWhen I look at the website, the game is red (as are all of them except for the one coming up on the 30th). Some of those games, when you click into the game to purchase hospitality/VIP tickets have some available but many have none available. I emailed their help and was told tickets would come available but no indication of what kind and when.\n\nBasically just looking for guidance from someone that has purchased tickets for a match on the best way to make sure I get some and don't miss out!\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n",

I was scrolling through Munuera's IG and noticed his posts that have more slides of players and stadium/atmosphere in it were Barca games. It shows him having a good time with their players or staff vs other posts where he looks more \"professional\" or it's just him in the frame. He'll rarely post pics with players from other teams and when he does it'll show him maybe arguing with them or showing a yellow or something, not smiling in admiration like he does with Barca. He also has more posts of him refereeing Barca games than any other teams. How is this allowed? He's obviously not trying to hide his bias in games either, he shouldn't be allowed to ref games for his favorite team or their direct opponents.",

        "content": "I dont know about u guys but a hated the passe choice he did at the end, there was plenty of Space on the center and left side to have a good attack\u2026 \n\nvery desapointed for the behavior dribbling 3 players is good but doin it to open up the play and speed up the attack is even better\n\nGood game anyway from KM10\n",

        "content": "\u26aa\u2728 Madrid kick off LaLiga with a 1\u20130 win over Osasuna!\n\nMbapp\u00e9\u2019s penalty made the difference, but it was far from smooth sailing in Xabi Alonso\u2019s debut on the touchline. Huijsen shone with composure beyond his years, Milit\u00e3o\u2019s return was encouraging, and Arda showed glimpses of magic. But against Osasuna\u2019s deep block, Madrid often ran out of ideas.\n\nWe\u2019ve broken down every performance, player by player.\n\nWho impressed you most tonight? And what would your rating for Xabi be?\n\nFeel free to follow MadridNoir on Instagram for more!",

        "content": "Even for RM fan standards. What\u2019s going on?? Guys this is the first game of the season with very little preparation time. Room for improvement, absolutely, but this is the first game for Pete\u2019s. We endured years of high blood pressure matches that we either won last minute or lost/tied. At least here we were in full control of the match.\n\nHere are some things to take away from the match:\n\n- We got 3 points against a very stubborn opponent with basically 8 men defense\n\n- No injuries and long term injured players are back in full force. Militao &amp; Carvajal looked great out there.\n\n- Depth in the squad like we\u2019ve never had. People also aren\u2019t playing out of position. Everyone in their favorite spot.\n\n- Super solid defense with barely any mistakes. No highway spaces like before. Huijsen and Tchou were great. Trent needs to gel in better but Carreras looked very promising and I see a Marcelo spark in him.\n\n- Much faster ball recovery and press.\n\n- Balls to sub Vini for Garcia. This is a huge point for Xabi\u2026 no one is protected from being subbed or rotated.\n\n- Rotate all players. Again, this is something we really lacked. This will keep our players fresh for the long season.\n\n- Trust in youngsters. Not just for the last 5 minutes. ",
