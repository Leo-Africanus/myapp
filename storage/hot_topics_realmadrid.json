Not only does Xabi value him and think he is important, but Ancelotti also thought the same. He has been a constant in the game for so long, being basically a guaranteed starter so far. He is good at tackling, cutting plays, and just being physical in the game. I feel like he is not talked about enough and even underrated by other fan based. He is not the best in his position, but he is still a good player. I think he is underrated because of his lack of passing skills and game creation. Physical players are not usually the most appreciated, but if he becomes a decent passer then he would probably be one of the best. ",

        "content": "I know it's a slightly long read, but please feel free to read and add anything you like. Remember, this is just my opinion, not an attack on you or your personal thoughts lol.\n\nI think Arda Guler will become our next Kroos but I can't prove it yet. I know that no one can replace Toni Kroos, yet we can still have a similar profile of player. Arda's current attack-oriented role seems fine for now, but I feel like he'll fit the deep midfield better as time goes on because of his attributes:\n\nArda has great technique and great game vision with excellent set-piece taking ability. However he is slow, and defending isn't his strong point. He can become the brain of the team as the years go by. As you know, the brain needs extra protection, which, in this metaphor, would be his teammates.\n\nA midfield consisting of 3-4 players should be balanced with the different profile of players, and I think we'll have that in the upcoming years:\n\nTchouam\u00e9ni is the tank, the holding midfielder, the aggressor (like Gattuso, like Casemiro), Fede is the lungs, the Swiss knife and the engine (like Gerrard, like Seedorf), Jude is the box-to-box attacking threat (like Lampard, like Bruno), and Arda is the elegant playmaker (right now he's more like Ozil, but he could be like Pirlo or Kroos as time goes, which is the point of my post). I think he fits deep midfield better, where his work rate won't matter as much since he'll be surrounded by some of the most resilient players in the world. Right now he's the creative outlet that occasionally gets exposed because of his weaknesses.\n\nOf course, if he wants to play deeper, he'll need to avoid any lapse of judgement like yesterday's disaster of an error against Marseille. He'll need to shield the ball well, make no simple passing errors, check his shoulders, always find the right pass etc. He showed he can do it before, but perfecting this role at 20 is very difficult, and I think both Xabi and the staff are willing to give him time to learn new things. I think he'll slowly be tailored to play deeper and in a few years' time, he'll become the brain of the team, dictating play and becoming the set-piece specialist too, like Kroos.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you think he'll stay as more of an attacking option throughout his Real Madrid career, or will he learn how to be the deep tempo-setter, passing hub/playmaker and improve in that direction? Let me know your thoughts \ud83d\udde3",

        "content": "As much as we love and cherish them, Vin\u00edcius Jr. and Valverde have not been performing at their best for some time now. The situations are different for each player. In Vin\u00edcius\u2019 case, it seems to be partly a mental struggle that affects his decision-making, combined with a noticeable drop in explosiveness\u2014he simply doesn\u2019t look as sharp as he did 18 months ago. Valverde\u2019s case, however, feels more tactical: we still don\u2019t seem to be using him in a way that maximizes his qualities. In any case, Xabi needs to find both the tactical solutions and the right words to bring them back to where they belong\u2014at the very top level.",
