There are 5 of us in total who will be attending.\n\nI\u2019m wondering whether it would be best to buy tickets now or wait until more are released to the general public closer to the match? I see some good seats on Stubhub that are not VIP/Hospitality - I\u2019m not sure if those are legitimate or a scam, since right now you can only buy VIP/hospitality seats directly from the club. \n\nI do have Madridista Premium but have heard that the ticket offerings are pretty picked over by the time they are released to the public. \n\nSociedad aren\u2019t great this year though so can I expect more/better tickets to be available closer to the match? \n\nAny insight or advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks!",

Of course, Bayern is something very special and it's a lot of fun at the club\". \n\nWhy are they so triggered about this? Not every player is gonna be Totti or Ryan Giggs for fvxk sake. \n\nFor example, I am a huge Real Madrid fan since birth and I was scouted by a Barcelona agent, years later I become a star in Barcelona but that is not my dream club, yes I appreciate Barcelona for making me a star but that is not my dream club. \n\nLennart Karl has always been a real Madrid fan, he has a picture where he wore the full Real Madrid kit, but he got scouted by a Bayern agent.\n\nLennart Karl is a great player but with Nico Paz coming back, Arda guler, Bellingham, Brahim,  i don't see him coming to Madrid.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this?",

I hope that if one day one of our players comes out and claims they would like to play somewhere else at some point, we do not do the same as Bayern. It\u2019s funny because I had Bayern as one of the best fan bases. Same with Liverpool, and then the whole Trent thing happened. It seems like when a player is going to Madrid they just hate to see it. I would not crash out over it unless one of our players pulls a figo. ",

        "content": "Look somewhere I\u2019m really glad that this superbly talented prospect is a Madrid fan. But he\u2019s not even completed his 1st full season at a huge club like Bayern so was it really necessary to basically indicate Bayern as sort of a stepping stone in his career? \n\nI\u2019m glad cause it\u2019s my club but what if Madrid don\u2019t go for him? Secondly where does he fit in? We\u2019re already struggling with Bellingham &amp; G\u00fcler in the same position now even if we sign Karl where do we play him? \n\nI think he\u2019s somewhat really sabotaged his Bayern career. The relationship with Bayern fans is 100% gonna be broken now plus I dunno how much game time he\u2019s gonna get especially with Musiala returning. \n\nSecondly I dunno if any other club is going to come for him cause they\u2019ll know in the back of their mind his first priority will always be a move to Madrid so why bother with a player not 100% committed to their cause? \n\nMadrid &amp; Barca are the dream destinations of almost every footballer globally. But to say it publicly this early in your career at a mammoth club like Bayern. I\u2019m somewhat confused really. \n\nIt worked for Huijsen TAA &amp; Mastantuono cause we needed those profiles. Karl Idk if we at all need him. ",
