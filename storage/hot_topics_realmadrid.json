It\u2019s very obvious he tripped himself and dived. It\u2019s criminal that it didn\u2019t go to VAR. The box is not a \u201cno-contact\u201d area, and if that was a penalty, Vin\u00edcius Jr. should be getting one every match.\n\nI\u2019m glad we won, but I\u2019m tired of seeing people trash Tchouam\u00e9ni when he\u2019s been quite impressive in build-up play. We\u2019ve really lacked a defender who\u2019s good with the ball, and since Kroos left, it\u2019s become essential to have that skill.\n\nAlso, we badly need a right-back. V\u00e1zquez and Carvajal are too old to be starting there; that\u2019s why they\u2019re injury-prone and struggle to keep up with attackers. When the right-back isn\u2019t performing, the center-back next to him takes on all the pressure.",
