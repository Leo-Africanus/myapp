But from the games I\u2019ve watched, he doesn\u2019t seem that bad. Like yeah, he\u2019s not peak Carvajal defensively, but he\u2019s not getting destroyed every week either.\n\nIs he really a huge weakness at the back? Or is it just that Liverpool\u2019s system leaves him more exposed and people fixate on every little mistake?\n\nWould love to hear what you guys think.",

Came across the Ankara Messi goal dubbed as the goal of the century and I was wondering what we as a community think of that term and is it appropriate for that goal. Not a Barca fan asking about it, just a Madrid fan curious of our beliefs and discuss I guess.",

        "content": "Hey Madridistas,\n\nWith the recent signing of Trent Alexander-Arnold, I'm really curious to know what you all think about the RB position going forward.\n\nDani Carvajal has been a loyal player to the club for over a decade, and to be fair, he had a solid season in 2023/24, especially stepping up in the UCL run. His defensive awareness, leadership, and chemistry with the rest of the backline have been invaluable. But we also know he's had injury issues in the past, and he's not getting any younger.\n\nNow enter Trent - arguably one of the best attacking fullbacks in the world. His passing range, set-piece ability, and creativity are elite. He could offer us a completely different dynamic from the right flank, especially when teams sit deep against us. However, he has often been criticized for his defensive positioning, especially in high-stakes games.",
