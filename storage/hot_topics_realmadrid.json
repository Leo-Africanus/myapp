        "content": "Yesterday\u2019s 4-0 defeat to PSG was painful, no doubt. But honestly I think this loss might actually help us in the long run.\n\nThis game clearly exposed some of our weak spots  especially in defense and up front. I hope this pushes the club to fully utilize the transfer window. We need proper reinforcements not just backups, but solid starters.\n\nYes, we\u2019ve got Vini and Mbapp\u00e9, but let's be real: they\u2019re not center-forwards. They thrive as wingers. Sure, Mbapp\u00e9 scored tons last season, but when did those goals come? Against who? When it mattered most  vs Liverpool,  Arsenal, and nowPSG  he went missing.\n\nDid you notice yesterday how PSG\u2019s attackers pressed our keeper and center-backs constantly? Meanwhile, our front three were waiting for quick counters  but to counter, you need the ball first. PSG controlled possession and suffocated our build-up.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about blaming individuals. The CB error? It happens. But the overall system looked off  (not xabi's fault) and that\u2019s why I\u2019m hoping the club realizes we need a true striker, more depth in defense, and maybe a few others with the hunger to fight in games like these.\n\nJust my take. I know some may disagree  and that\u2019s totally fair. I just love this club and want us to improve from here.\n\nHala Madrid. \ud83e\udd0d",

I agree that this was not the time to experiment with formation, but how is Xabi meant to prevent mistakes like acensio and rudiger made? People are forgetting how much better we played for every match before this other than maybe the first one for obvious reasons because it was his first match with the team. He hasn\u2019t been coaching them for long, and PSG is arguably the best team in the world right now and literally just won the champions league so it\u2019s expected that they will play incredibly well. \n\nXabi can try his best to improve the team but if the players keep playing like this and making lazy mistakes then there is not much he can do, he\u2019s not magic. Xabi isn\u2019t the problem the players are, which should be obvious but apparently some people think no after one bad game Xabi is a bad coach and worse than Carlo and the team is back to how they were last season. \n\nOn a positive, at least we have a bit more time before laliga",

        "title": "Throwback to the last time Real Madrid faced PSG and Karim Benzema scored a hattrick in 17 minutes after being 0-2 down",
        "content": "When PSG were drawn against Real Madrid, everyone expected a PSG win. They had prime Mbappe, Neymar, Messi, and Di Mar\u00eda. And us? We had Karim, a developing Vinicius, Modric, and Courtois. Our squad had flaws. Kroos was struggling, Casemiro wasn\u2019t sharp, and every time the ball neared Carvajal, we panicked. All our hopes were on Courtois, Modri\u0107, Vini, and of course, Benzema, the man carrying our attack since Ronaldo's departure.\n\nBut when the scoreboard read 0\u20132 in the 60th minute, all hope seemed lost. Madrid fans were chanting Mbappe's name instead of chanting our own players. Then came the moment that changed everything: a 17-minute hat-trick from the best player in the world that night which launched a campaign of goals and elite playmaking. Everyone talks about the Manchester City game and rightfully so but this game against PSG was just as legendary.\n\nStill, the headlines from CBS with Jamie, ESPN etc focused on PSG\u2019s collapse rather than the brilliance of Benzema, who scored a knockout-stage hat-trick while losing 0\u20132 in 17 minutes. He never got the praise he deserved, not even from Madrid fans, despite a better big-game resume than Suarez or Lewa without being the focal point of attack until 2019 and never being a traditional No. 9.",

        "content": "Just wanted to see what you guys think about today's game. Extremely disappointing mistakes considering they are both professionals playing at the highest level in football and for one of the best teams to ever exist. \n\nRudiger was non existent in 3rd goal, apparently makes the same mistake in every pressure game . The mistake leading to 2nd goal , I don't even know what to say. \n\nEdit: A lot of people defending rudiger for what he did today? I have never seen a player miss a ball like that, NEVER let alone a starting CB for Real Madrid ! It shows how bad we have fallen! \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f And if you think Rudiger was elite last season, go watch the matches where we actually played decent teams, and count how many times he was caught off position, how many times has he tried to press someone and left space where a boeing could pass through, and how many of those caused us to concede goals ! Then we can have a conversation on how elite he has been and how he carried us last season! \n\nAny average CB would get the job done against smaller teams when most of the game is played in the opponent's half. True test comes when you play against an actual decent team and Rudiger was exposed in every one of these games last season. ",

        "content": "I know we're all frustrated about last night's result but I don't think there's actually any need for panic stations\n\nWhat we saw last night was nothing we hadn't already known for the whole of this past season. We need ball players in order to play better and we cannot support a 3 attack formation against the elite teams.\n\nWe all knew when we lost both Trent and Dean that it was going to be an uphill battle to beat the PSG press (which is the best in the world). In fact it's likely that PSG pressed us harder than they would precisely because they knew we lacked those 2.\n\nWe also knew since at least last season that we don't have a balanced and deadly enough attack to justify playing 3 of them. The 3 attacker formation didn't work in the 22/23 season. In the 21/22 it didn't work (we played Valverde as a \"right winger\"). And even last year when we hardly lost we fastidiously played a 2 man attack. \n\nSo anyone with that knowledge of history already knew we had signed our death warrant by trying it against a team of PSG's calibre. And luckily for us Alonso admitted it openly in the press conference that it was a mistake.\n\nSo there's no need to panic. The team is still going to be trained and refined over the next few weeks and months. Camavinga will return and hopefully Ceballos will also get back to full fitness and readiness. Jude will have surgery and rest and hopefully will recover his best form in the latter half of next season.\n\nOur defense is a concern but it looks like we're a lock to get Carreras. One more CB and I think we'll be good. Rudiger needs proper rest. He's a great defender as we've seen over the first half of this season and the whole of last season. The new CB will also allow Militao to be eased back in cos if he can recover his best form we'll have one of the best CBs in the world again.\n\nAs for the attack, I am in support of not selling Rodrygo because I want him and Vini to really have to fight it out to show the coach they deserve to play. It will bring out the best in them. Whoever loses his place can then be sold next season probably for really good money. I'm not convinced as others are that it is Vini that is the best option to keep.\n\nAll in all we are just one CB and closing of the Carreras deal away from giving Xabi all the tools he needs to lead us to a great season. I firmly believe we're going to win the league next season and I think we'll once again be at the very latter stages of the UCL.",

        "content": "First I want to start off that none of this is xabis fault. He barely had any time with the players for this tournament.  His system can work very well for us if he has the full backing of the board and Perez.\n\nStarting off with the defense: Rudiger is clearly not what he used to be, knee injury or not, he is not Real Madrid level anymore and we need to accept that. Him and Alaba need to go. Send acensio on a loan for him to develop better and come back stronger. Fran is good against the mid teams but fumbles under giants, the Carreras signing is well needed. Militao and carvajal did more than what our entire defense did in 20 minutes. They should stay as backups. Huijsen is absolutely critical to have as he is the only defender that can build from the back and pass. We need to sign another CB ASAP. I was hoping we would get saliba but konate looks more realistic but I would not mind him either. I think he could compliment huijsen pretty well. \n\n\nMidfield: it is so evident that we NEED a creative midfielder. Right now arda is the closest thing we have to that but he still has a lot to learn. Bringing in someone like stiller or a profile similar to Kroos is crucial for breaking defensive lines. Valverde is NOT a RB and should never be placed there again. Even though he did well there last season, it won\u2019t work with Alonso\u2019s system. Bellingham should\u2019ve gotten his shoulder surgery after we got knocked out the UCL so he could be fully ready for next season. \n\n\nAttack: Vini\u2026. Oh Vini. He is absolutely useless. I know I will get hate for that but he can\u2019t keep getting away with this. He doesn\u2019t do anything. Doesn\u2019t press, doesn\u2019t track back, hogs the ball, tries to dribble like prime Messi, can\u2019t pass etc etc.. I always defended Vini even after the 24/25 ended but I can\u2019t defend him anymore. He needs to be sold, we will get no where with him. Ever since that ballon dor snub, he\u2019s not been the same. Trust me I am grateful for everything he has done for this club but it\u2019s time. Him and mbappe didn\u2019t work and it never will work. We should put our full trust in mbappe in the attack. Put him alongside Gonzalo or Franco, and he\u2019ll cook. Let him get the well needed rest. Gonzalo is the Joselu type profile that we needed. Not a good game today but he\u2019s fresh and inexperienced, let him grow. I love how he presses and tracks back too. Rodrygo is clearly going to leave so I don\u2019t want to say anything about him, especially since he barely got any minutes. \n\nOverall, we need to trust xabi because his system really works wonders. We just need to give him the players he needs and asks for. Players that works with his style of play and we will cook next season. I hope this was a wake up call for Perez and that we shouldn\u2019t stop with Carreras. Sign sign sign, how ever many players he needs. Give him full backing. So far we got huijsen, Trent, Franco, and Carreras. Konate/Saliba and stiller will be perfect too. Maybe also another ST but I believe in Gonzalo. But most importantly, I believe in Xabi Alonso. Bring the treble home \ud83c\udfc6 \ud83c\udfc6 \ud83c\udfc6. \n\nEdit: I did not touch on mbappe much because I want to see how he plays without Vini first in this system. But yes, he is also very lazy and needs to work on that too but he\u2019s still incredibly much better than Vini. And I do think we should build the team around him because right now we don\u2019t and he feeds off that. He\u2019ll get more goals that way and ultimately that\u2019s what he\u2019s here for. ",
