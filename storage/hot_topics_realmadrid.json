He\u2019s already a big big player in the premier league which is one of the most difficult/physical in the world, especially as a CB. As expected a host of big clubs have already courted him. Also, dont get why people say \u201ches unproven\u201d. When you play week in week out for such a good side and get called up for spain and is the starting cb, idk how much more proven you can find at his age. Secondly, the boy is a Madrid fan. He seemingly loves madrid and his fav is our very own Ramos. Finally, his price. I know his release clause of 50m is a bit steep and madrid has refrained for going for high cost players lately but the fact that they dont have to outbid any clubs and the player himself is willing to join makes everything so much more straightforward. I say get the guy in",

Great presser, ball caring, and \u201cdestroyer\u201d in the midfield while also having a taller frame and more pace than Neves. Cama is truly amazing to watch on his day, so what exactly is holding him back from taking the next step to becoming a solidified world class CM?",

        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nMy friends and I are all very big futbol fans and are travelling to Madrid this summer. We will be there for the 25th and want to attend the last game of the season vs Real Sociedad.\n\nFrom what I am reading online it seems like only VIP tickets are out right now which are quite pricy. GA tickets only come on sale a week before and I would want to get 5 of them.  Would I need to buy a membership to buy the tickets, or wait in a queue? I\u2019m not sure what the procedure is.\n\nIf anyone has advice or can help walk me through it I would really appreciate it!",
