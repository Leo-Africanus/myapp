        "content": "Isn\u2019t it odd that in the previous years, Man City always was the favorite to win the games because their obvious superiority dominance in every game and we still somehow managed to win and this year, we (Madrid) are the favorite to move to the next round. I hope they don\u2019t play the reverse uno card on us. \n\nHonestly, what is Carlo thinking about by playing with Vazquez and Tchouameni?! Fede can play for Vazquez, I know we loose him in the middle but we can play with Modric who has been doing great in the last games (I can\u2019t believe he is still playing that good) Ceballos and Bellingham. Asencio needs to play in any position either central back or in the right. \nOur attack is finally tuned in, either with Rodrygo or Vinicius in the left. Rodrygo has been on fire!",

Also, Antonio David takes Chema's place\n\n\ud83d\udd04 88' - Baba Diocou on for Borja Alonso \n\n\u26bd 90'+2 - Algeciras pull one back with a header from a corner\n\n\u26bd 90'+6 - GOLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - GOLAAAAZOOO GARC\u00cdA - it's the last minute of the match, Gonzalo takes a shot from over 25m out, and he blasts an absolute rocket into the bottom left corner for his second poker of the season! What a cheat code of a player in this division\n\nFT - after a timid first half, in the second half Gonzalo put on a show, scoring his goals #16, #17, #18 and #19 of the season, pulling an amazing 7 goals clear at the top of the league's goalscorer leaderboard - Algeciras were not really dangerous throughout the entirety of the match, and Castilla ended up being efficient with their chances in the form of Gonzalo. The team's great form continues and they benefit greatly from the return of their injured players, Manu \u00c1ngel, Jacobo and Borja Alonso have been great since coming back. The team is 7th, 2 points outside the playoff spots for the moment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 20:30 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee**: Luis Bestard Servera\n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 2, Matchday 22\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[FEF TV](https://feftv.com) (subscription - 12.99\u20ac/month)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (5-2-3): Mario de Luis - Youssef Enr\u00edquez \u2018Yusi\u2019, Mario Rivas, Jacobo Ram\u00f3n, Quique Ribes, David Jim\u00e9nez - Jos\u00e9 Maria Andr\u00e9s \u2018Chema\u2019 (84' Antonio David), Manuel \u00c1ngel (84' Andr\u00e9s Campos) - Borja Alonso (88' Baba Diocou), Gonzalo Garc\u00eda, Pol Fortuny \n\nBench: Fran Gonz\u00e1lez (GK), V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as 'Valde', Edgar Pujol, David Ruiz, Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez, Jacobo Ortega. \n\nUnavailable: Diego Pi\u00f1eiro (?), Ra\u00fal Asencio (first team call-up), David Cuenca (pubalgia), Loren Aguado (first team call-up), C\u00e9sar Palacios (ACL tear), Jeremy de Le\u00f3n (ankle injury), Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga (muscle injury). \n\nCoach: Ra\u00fal\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** WLWWD\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 11th | 26pt | 6-6-7 | 34:25\n",
