Each of us moderators received **\u20ac50,000** in the deal, and while we know this decision will disappoint many of you, the offer was simply too big to turn down, please try to put yourself in our position.\n\nWe truly regret that it has come to this. Over the years, this subreddit has been a home for passionate Real Madrid fans, a place where we celebrated victories, debated transfers, and lived through every high and low together. It\u2019s heartbreaking to see it come to an end in this way.\n\nBut this **isn\u2019t the end**\u2014we still have a place to rebuild our community. From now on, we will be moving to r/ChampionsLeague, where we can continue discussing all things Real Madrid. It won\u2019t be the same at first, but with time, we can make it our new home. We hope to see all of you there so we can keep this amazing fanbase together.\n\nThank you for everything, and as always\u2014**Hala Madrid!** \ud83d\udc9c",

        "content": "It might be a bit early to talk about Ancelotti's replacement since we still don't know if Don Carlo is gonna be our manager next season or not. But there are so many posts all around social media about \"who's gonna be our next manager\" and I noticed that many Real Madrid fans seem to be unimpressed with Xabi Alonso, maybe because he probably won't win the Bundesliga title for the second season in a row.\n\nI understand if you prefer another manager to take this job, but criticizing Xabi Alonso as a manger doesn't really make any sense. \n\nPeople don't realize that Bayer Leverkusen finishing this season as \\*\\*2nd\\*\\* is actually another big achievement for Xabi as a manager. We're talking about a team that was 17th after 8 games in 2022/23 and Alonso managed to carry this team to finish 6th and play in Europe. To win the league title (UNBEATEN) one year after. And now he will most likely finish in the 2nd place which is HUGE for a team like Leverkusen.\n\nBelieve it or not, since 2002/03, Bayer Leverkusen only finished in the 2nd place one time in 2010/11.. only one time in the last 23 years! And many of us are not impressed with Alonso this season?\n\nWinning 3 titles with a team like Leverkusen in 2 years. Reaching Europa League Final. Being Top 6 in the UCL league phase this season... I don't know what else he should do to prove that he's the right manager for us after Carlo!",

        "content": "My family of 4 (2 minors, 15 and 12) is planning on visiting Madrid and, as football fans, we want to go to Bernabeu's tour. However we've noticed that some parts of the tour are restricted because of some construction work in the stadium. My question is, even with the restricted parts, is it worth it? And also, will the construction have ended by the start of July (that's when the trip will happen)? Thank you",
