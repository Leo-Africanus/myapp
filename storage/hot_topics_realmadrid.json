The results of this question was 2.42. \n\nThe next question was about whose fault is the UCL elimination against Arsenal. This question is realy close, so I think there's not winner at all.\n\nThen I ask wich player/s should RM sell.\n*As I'm stupid af I typed Eduard Mendy intead of Ferland, when I realized I edited it so just sum up the votes and %\n\nAnother question was wich posistion should RM reinforce. I typed the majority of possitions but I added the option to add more. \n\nIn the next question I asked for players to sign this summer transfer window:\n\nHuijsen 34\nTAA 26\nWirtz 10\nVitinha 4\nM.

        "content": "I never have time to watch Barcelona's games, but I did twice now, with la Copa and today's game. I saw Yamal and, yes, he's really good and creates a lot of chances, but he misses a lot of passes, too. He makes unnecessary and useless dribbles, and attempts crosses that get nowhere. However, I see madridistas all the time showering him in praises they never have for Vinicius.\n\nVini has been an incredibly effective player for years and he has been doing that in high profile games as well. But he gets trashed over and over because of his misses, like his good plays didn't exist. Is it really that difficult to show him more support than what is shown to the rival?\n\nEdit after reading the responses:\n\nIt looks like there are a few big reasons, some of them might overlap, some of them are contradictory.\n\n1) Lamine Yamal is 17, so he'll learn how to fix bad passes and refine his shots, while Vinicius is 24 (some people say 25) and he is peaking; this is kind of comparing Yamal today with Vinicius at 17\n\n2) Vinicius was the best player last season, even if he got the Ballon D'Or denied, so the expectations are higher\n\n3) Lamine Yamal is absolutely better than Vinicius and he's not missing passes (contradicts 1 and 2)\n\n4) Lamine Yamal has a better attitude than Vinicius, both in behavior and in trying to recover the ball when he loses it (in line with 1, but kind of contradicts 3)\n\n5) Barcelona players do a better job positioning themselves in the field, so Yamal passes are more likely to find a target and the team is more likely to recover the ball if he misses a pass \n\n6) Barcelona has a wonderful PR machine\n\n7) Real Madrid fans like to trash their players\n\n\nI'm inclined to think it's a combination of 1, 4, 5, and 7.",

        "title": "Unpopular opinion: The board did nothing wrong by not signing a \"Kroos replacement\"",
        "content": "**Before you downvote**, no, I'm not saying that the board hasn't done their fair share of mistakes. Especially going into the season with our only CBs being Rudiger and Militao just returning from an ACL injury was dumb. I believe that was the worst decision since selling Makelele and it clearly doomed our season.\n\nNow that this is out of the way, here's why I think blaming the board for not getting \"someone like Kroos\" in the summer is peak hindsight and makes zero sense as an argument:\n\n1. From the very first friendly game of the pre-season, it was clear that the era of 442 diamond was over and that 433 was gonna be our main formation from now on, in order to accomodate for the front three. And the 433 remained for most of the season. So, we had Tchouameni, Valverde, Bellingham, Modric, Ceballos and Camavinga as midfielder options. Plus Arda, who started a couple of games in the midfield very early in the season: *Real Valladolid (H), Real Sociedad (A)* and he clearly performs better as a CM/AM compared to RW. So, **6-7 players to cover 3 positions.** It didn't make any sense at the time to buy yet another midfielder and even if we found the perfect \"Kroos replacement\" (more on that later), where was he supposed to play? Fede - Jude are undroppable and benching Tchouameni would have created further imbalances in the XI, because we all know that playing without a proper DM never ends well (again the Makelele-Beckham situation, 14/15, 22/23 vs City, City themselves in the 2021 final or this season etc). Tchou - Fede - Jude were Carlo's preferred trio as long as \"everyone\" were healthy at the start of the season *(Atalanta, Mallorca)*. Even when Rodrygo was not ready to start in the 0-4 Clasico, he wasn't replaced by any of the available \"controllers\" (Modric, Ceballos, Arda), but we got a 442 flat with Cama, Tchou, Jude and Fede. The only reason players like Modric and then Ceballos were even pushed in the line-up was because Tchou had to play CB and Valverde RB, due to injuries. We had more than enough midfielders, the problem is that half of them were either covering for injured/underperforming defenders (that's where the board should be blamed) and the other half had injuries themselves (Camavinga, Ceballos).\n2. You don't necessairily need a \"controller\" in your midfield. I know this concept sounds insane after 10+ years with Modric &amp; Kroos, but there are teams that have succeeded without that sort of player. Klopp's Liverpool is a prime example of that, reaching 2 UCL finals and winning the EPL with a midfield of Henderson, Fabinho &amp; Wijndaldum/Milner. The Tchou-Fede-Jude trio is much more talented/creative than those. **The problem is the lack of creativity/control from other areas.** Liverpool had TAA and Robertson on top of their game, also Firmino dropping deep and becoming an extra \"midfielder\" when needed. Meanwhile we spent most of the season with Lucas and Mendy in terrible form and a lazy front three with questionable tactical instructions. A Kroos-esque player could have made our lives a bit easier during the season, yes, but our lack of options on other positions and poor tactics were much bigger issues. Finally, even if the more \"physical\" Tchou/Cama - Fede - Jude lacked creativity/control, it should have at least been excellect at pressing, but we were the opposite of that, as a team. Our tactics were too weak, predictable and easily exploited by any above average team/manager.\n3. **There's no Kroos 2.0 on the market.** Kroos was truly unique and impossible to replace, but even the players with even a bit similar style are very rare. Unless the proposition was to spend... 120m+ for the likes of Vitinha, Barella, Macallister or Enzo (lol), there were barely any options. Even with someone like Zubimendi, who clearly wanted to stay at La Real last season, we go back to point #1: *where would he play?* Would Ancelotti bench Tchouameni for him? Or would Zubimendi even be the first midfielder option from the bench, considering Camavinga would be there? (Different profiles, but you get the point). Or, would Zubimendi/*\\[insert Kroos replacement\\]* accept to compete with 6-7 other midfielders for 3 positions?\n\nThe biggest problem was Ancelotti never changing the 433 Vini - Mbappe - Rodrygo all season, plus our lack of proper defenders, not board's \"refusal\" to sign that imaginary Kroos replacement. I'm all in for blaming the board, but we should at least do it for the right reasons. Plus, Ceballos (earlier in the season) and Arda (all season) deserved far more chances, even Rio Ferdinand said that recently. I think selling Rodrygo, going back to 442 diamond, with Trent RB, new LB &amp; a new manager will sort out pretty much every creativity/control issue in our midfield and wider areas, without needing to buy a Kroos-like player. *(Although we'll need a new midfielder, if Modric leaves.)*",
