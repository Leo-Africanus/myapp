He came through the youth ranks at M\u00e1laga and in 2021 signed for Juventus, where he made his first-team debut in a match against AC Milan.

In case like Alaba where they might not be able to perform anymore but are waiting too see out their contracts, it's perfectly fine too. It's their right as per the contract.\n\nI hope people stop dismissing their achievements and contributions just because they are no longer up to the task.\n\nEdit: This also extends to our beloved DON.",
