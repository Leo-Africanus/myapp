A player can be good and still not fit a team. Mbappe is essentially a winger. He\u2019ll never be a striker because he does not play like that.\n\nWe payed a massive bonus to a player who we did not need, and we have also given him so much priority. If we had a striker like Ekitike or Kane (closest thing to Benzema) we would have someone to run in the box. Someone to support play, and to take advantage of Vini\u2019s and Trent\u2019s crosses. I honestly see no way we start consistently playing well as a team without a 9. This is obviously not the only problem, our defense and midfield need improvement. But, It is crazy we dropped around 120 million just as a bonus, on a player we didn\u2019t even need. We shot ourselves in the foot.",

        "content": "After watching the game and thinking about it calmly, the problem was not only the result vs Osasuna. The bigger issue was the mentality and decisions before and during the match.\n\nWe played like this game was not important. No intensity, no pressing early, no strong personality on the pitch. In this stage of the season (around matchday 25), these are the matches that decide the league. You don\u2019t rotate heavily here if you really want to kill the title race.\n\nResting key defenders and starting a shaky backline together was very risky, especially away in a tough stadium. You could already feel the lack of confidence from the first minutes. The first goal we conceded was basically a gift, and after that the team looked mentally fragile.\n\nOffensively, Vini was the only one really trying to create danger with his runs, but there was almost no support inside the box. Many times he beats his man and crosses low, and nobody attacks the 6-yard box. This has been a repeated problem for years.\n\nMbapp\u00e9 also looked disconnected. Sometimes he makes the run too early, sometimes he doesn\u2019t attack the space at all. Those small details make a big difference in tight games like this.\n\nWhat frustrated me more was the in-game management. The team needed changes early in the second half to increase width and intensity, but the reaction came late. And taking Valverde off after he gave us momentum was a very strange decision.\n\nOsasuna is not a weak team, especially at home, but the way we approached the match made them look stronger than they are. When you send a message with your lineup that the focus is somewhere else (like Champions League), the players also subconsciously drop intensity.\n\nReal Madrid is not always required to win UCL every year, but La Liga consistency is a must. You win leagues with seriousness in these difficult away games, not only in big nights at the Bernab\u00e9u.\n\nToday felt less like a simple loss, and more like a loss of focus on what should be the main objective this season: the league.",

My concern is how he fits this team structurally.\n\nUsing the Osasuna match as an example, Madrid often looked like they were playing with 10 men in possession. There was no consistent presence in the box, attacks had no central reference point, and too often he stayed static or drifted into Vin\u00edcius\u2019 zone instead of occupying defenders.\n\nWhen that happens:\n\n- the box is empty when crosses come in\n- Vini gets doubled more eeasil\n- transitions die because there\u2019s no focal point\n\nIt\u2019s not about effort or talent \u2014 it\u2019s about role overlap. Both he and Vini naturally attack from the left channel, and right now the team doesn\u2019t look structurally balanced when they share the pitch.\n\nHonestly, in some matches the team looks more coherent without him, which shouldn\u2019t be the case for a player of his level.\n\nIf Arbeloa (or the staff in general) doesn\u2019t address the positional discipline and attacking structure, I don\u2019t see Madrid winning anything this season \u2014 not because of individual quality, but because the system still feels unresolved.",

The ball simply ends up going out from the other end. I mean how much of \u2018analysis\u2019 does it take to understand a winger NEEDS a forward to score? Atp it\u2019s completely Vini dependence, he dribbles, he pressures, he traces back, he makes the crosses, and he should score. One game without form or bad luck and we drop points despite having world class players running back and forth playing like they\u2019ve never seen a ball. Mbappe is not at all present at the box, what else is his duty? He doesn\u2019t track back enough to at least mention a defensive support. Just a non existent forward passing the ball around. Trent is lovely with the through balls, but if there isn\u2019t anyone forward, to whom should he send a through? We CANNOT get ourselves to win placing all hopes on Vini alone.",

        "content": "We have squad full of wonderful players. Like Endrick is shinning currently on loan. But something has not been right. The football we were playing in last few years was not beautiful but now we have started to lose games as well. This season we did not play well, had lot of injuries, sacked manager despite we managed to be in the title race. Laliga including Barcelona being in poor run is masking our weakness. All we have are star players and big names. At what point do you think the board and club will realize things are not working and squad needs massive overhaul. ",
