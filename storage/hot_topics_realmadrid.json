        "content": "Camavinga Refuses to Give Up\nAfter suffering a major muscle injury on April 23, Eduardo Camavinga was expected to miss the rest of the season, including the Club World Cup. But the French midfielder has shown strong progress, sharing photos of his training with boots and ball \u2014 even alongside Alaba. With 11 days left before Real Madrid\u2019s debut in the tournament, he could be ready just in time.\n\nIf fully recovered, Camavinga would be a huge boost for Xabi Alonso\u2019s squad, almost like a new signing. Despite missing 25 matches this season due to four separate injuries (totaling 135 days out), he\u2019s now close to full fitness.\n\nHis return would help ease Madrid\u2019s injury crisis, with key players like Militao, Carvajal, Mendy, R\u00fcdiger, and others having missed recent games. Fortunately, Vinicius and Brahim are already back, and Courtois, Valverde, and Rodrygo could rejoin soon.\n\nThe Club World Cup might be Camavinga\u2019s last chance to salvage an injury-plagued season.\n",
