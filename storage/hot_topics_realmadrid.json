I hope we can make space for his return sooner rather than later. I think Cama has had enough time to show us consistent elite form, but hasn\u2019t delivered. It might be time to give up space for this star boy. ",

He had left that position far behind before even coming to Madrid. Even at the 2020 Euros, when France had literally Benzema as a striker, they were still playing 3-4-1-2, with both Benzema and Mbappe as CF\n\nIt can also be seen that he has had better stats as CF too.\n\nCompare that to Vini, who won the best player in the world award(FIFA the Best) and came second in Ballon d'Or, being one of the main reason Real Madrid had their most succesful season since the 1960's, as a LEFT WINGER.\n\n  \nVini was straight up the best winger in football, for at least 3 years. Even now he has more G/A than any other winger in the world, except for Bayern's\n\n",

He will be fantastic for Real Madrid)\n\nCarlo had clearer instructions for defenders. For attackers, it was more about finding ways to liberate them, to find spaces for them to sign. No set philosophy, no strict tactical setup, no demand on what players to sign and what kind. But an old school manager with a good grasp of modern football. I think for big European nights, Carlo (along with Zizou- but they do have similar traits) will always be the one we think of for a long long time. It wasn't always pretty, but boy did they grind out results.. What a man!",

        "content": "\u201cIt was just a bit disappointing that final third there wasn\u2019t really that kind of quality you\u2019d expect from Real Madrid players.\u201d  \n  \nThe main focus of Bale\u2019s criticism fell on the attacking area. The Welshman lamented the\u00a0**\"lack of quality\"**\u00a0in the final third, directly pointing to figures like Mbapp\u00e9 and Vinicius J\u00fanior:\u00a0**\"They didn\u2019t produce any magic. It was disappointing that in the final third there wasn\u2019t the quality you expect from Real Madrid\"**. A statement that highlights the club\u2019s reliance on individual brilliance that, on big nights, doesn\u2019t always show up.\n\nThis offensive shortcoming led Bale to identify a structural need: the arrival of a reference center forward. The former footballer explained that crosses and attacking moves were left without a finisher, an obvious tactical gap.\u00a0**\"Sometimes you need to go and test the defender. There was no one in the box for the crosses. Maybe you need a \u20189\u2019\"**, he concluded, hitting the nail on the head regarding the role of a classic striker.",
