        "title": "Throwback to the last time Real Madrid faced PSG and Karim Benzema scored a hattrick in 17 minutes after being 0-2 down",
        "content": "When PSG were drawn against Real Madrid, everyone expected a PSG win. They had prime Mbappe, Neymar, Messi, and Di Mar\u00eda. And us? We had Karim, a developing Vinicius, Modric, and Courtois. Our squad had flaws. Kroos was struggling, Casemiro wasn\u2019t sharp, and every time the ball neared Carvajal, we panicked. All our hopes were on Courtois, Modri\u0107, Vini, and of course, Benzema, the man carrying our attack since Ronaldo's departure.\n\nBut when the scoreboard read 0\u20132 in the 60th minute, all hope seemed lost. Madrid fans were chanting Mbappe's name instead of chanting our own players. Then came the moment that changed everything: a 17-minute hat-trick from the best player in the world that night which launched a campaign of goals and elite playmaking. Everyone talks about the Manchester City game and rightfully so but this game against PSG was just as legendary.\n\nStill, the headlines from CBS with Jamie, ESPN etc focused on PSG\u2019s collapse rather than the brilliance of Benzema, who scored a knockout-stage hat-trick while losing 0\u20132 in 17 minutes. He never got the praise he deserved, not even from Madrid fans, despite a better big-game resume than Suarez or Lewa without being the focal point of attack until 2019 and never being a traditional No. 9.",

Is he still available? What is preventing us from signing him? \n\nMost likely, Rodrygo is leaving this window, if we got \u20ac80+ for him, other clubs will know we have cash and will start asking more for their players.

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI know this is sort of off topic but I have this scarf from the 2009 game and I was wondering if anyone knows what it may be worth? I found a buyer but they asked how much I\u2019d sell it for but I don\u2019t want to give too high of a price and look ridiculous but I also don\u2019t want to sell myself short!\n\nThanks in advance ",
