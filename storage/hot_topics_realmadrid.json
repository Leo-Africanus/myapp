But one of them just played a full season at Real Madrid and earned Brazil call-ups. The other is back in Brazil struggling to find form.\n\nStats don\u2019t tell the whole story but they do help.

I can understand why would back out last minute because he\u2019s one of their best players this season and you wouldn\u2019t want to go in to a tournament without your best guys. What confuses me, is the fact he didn\u2019t play a single minute today knowing that this was a must win match and you need your best starting eleven. This just seems like pettiness me honestly; and if that\u2019s the case why didn\u2019t you let him come to us in the first place. What do you guys think",

I feel like we spent 50m\u00a3 on one of the most promising players, and then never gave him a shot. Which is only natural right, we have such a stacked team.\n\n  \nShouldnt we loan him out or sell him with a buy-back clause like Nico Paz?",

        "content": "Xabi Alonso\u2019s 3-5-2 worked perfectly in Germany and looking at the players we have, it could work just as well at Madrid. We\u2019ve got the midfield depth, the pace up top, and defenders who can hold a line and push forward when needed. If we end up signing Carreras, that left side becomes dangerous. The balance across this formation is exciting and if we can stay healthy, this could be one of the most dynamic lineups we\u2019ve had in years. What do you think about this setup? I\u2019ll drop the full visual in the comments.",

I was fortunate enough to be credentialed for the FIFA World Cup, and last night I had the opportunity to cover an incredible evening for you all\u2014both in terms of the football on display and the energy from the fanbase gathered at the home of the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nMy photographer, Carl Gulbish, was pitch-side and captured some fantastic moments from the night. I hope you all enjoy the photos!\n\n[Credit: Carl Gulbish for https:\\/\\/nunezj.substack.com](https://preview.redd.it/x2f3p44iej9f1.jpg?width=3120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9203b5694b655a09304368975ed3eac9b03fd805)\n\n[https:\\/\\/nunezj.substack.com](https://preview.redd.it/m52u954iej9f1.jpg?width=3660&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c27a498aeb1fde1a1b4d592b6adffff3a2ffedd)\n\n\n\n",
