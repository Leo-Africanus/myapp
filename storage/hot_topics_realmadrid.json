He also loves the fucking club which is something  we need. The fact that some of you are turning on him and trying to sell him is laughable to me because he would go to a club like Liverpool and turn up and we would regret it. Not to mention he\u2019s done so much for this club so we can\u2019t do anything but respect and thank this guy ",

        "title": "Rodrygo Has Run Out of Options",
        "content": "Rodrygo Goes, the Brazilian winger at Real Madrid, finds himself in a complex situation regarding his professional future. Despite being highly regarded in Europe, his role at the club has been drastically reduced, with very limited participation in key matches like the Copa del Rey final and the Club World Cup final. Real Madrid is considering selling him to complete two crucial transactions in the transfer window, though no formal offers have yet been received.\n\nClubs such as Bayern Munich and Liverpool have opted for other targets, while Arsenal has not advanced beyond preliminary interest. Only Tottenham remains as a potential suitor, albeit a less prominent one. This leaves Rodrygo with few alternatives amid declining physical and emotional condition, having lost weight and confidence. The club would only entertain offers of around \u20ac100 million, which presents a significant hurdle in today\u2019s competitive market.\n\nA Market in Flux\n\nAs the global market heads toward a high-stakes finish in spending, there are still players looking for a new space to shine. Rodrygo, born in 2001 in Osasco, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, is among them  \ufffc.\n\nWhile he\u2019s on many clubs\u2019 radar, and Real Madrid hasn\u2019t yet received an official offer, the club\u2019s planning includes his departure to fund the final moves needed to complete their dream squad  \ufffc. Rodrygo played only 45 minutes in the Copa del Rey final against Barcelona in April and 92 minutes in the Club World Cup\u2014indicating how limited his game time has become  \ufffc.\n\nAlthough Rodrygo and his representatives have publicly expressed his desire to remain at Madrid, reports suggest the club views him as a transfer candidate following his substitution in the Copa del Rey final  \ufffc.\n\nPhysical and Mental Decline\n\nSince then, Rodrygo has struggled with a physical imbalance that caused him to lose nearly five kilos, as well as an emotional downturn due to his lack of effectiveness in front of goal. Even a stay in Brazil with his two children did not fully help him clear his mind  \ufffc.\n\nInterest Fading from Big Clubs\n\nDespite maintaining a strong reputation across Europe, major clubs are looking elsewhere. Bayern has decided to sign Luis D\u00edaz (for around \u20ac80 million) and Liverpool has not progressed its interest in Rodrygo. Real Madrid insists on offers close to \u20ac100 million if a sale is to happen  \ufffc.\n\nLiverpool\u2019s considerable winter spending\u2014such as Wirtz (\u20ac125M) and Ekitike (\u20ac95M)\u2014may also explain the lack of movement regarding Rodrygo  \ufffc. Meanwhile, Arsenal has already invested roughly \u20ac200 million in Zubimendi (\u20ac70M), Madueke (\u20ac56M), and Gy\u00f6keres (\u20ac75M), reducing appetite for another major forward signing  \ufffc.\n\nOnly Tottenham remains an option\u2014but it\u2019s seen as a step down compared to the other clubs. Gradually, Rodrygo is running out of viable alternatives to leave Real Madrid this summer  ",

Arsenal also talk so much, they say they will pay big money, but still no real bid. PSG even, but Real Madrid says no offer came yet.

He is a selfless player that can finish chances cuz of his amazing positional awareness and finishing skills. \n\nI would like to see Belli + Mbappe upfront with Valverde-Tchou-Arda behind them with Carreas and Trent on the wings, and a back 3.\n\nI know Belli is out till October but I really feel like this is more balanced than Vini+Mbappe upfront. Reason why I picked Mbappe over Vini is simply because Mbappe is a better central forward than Vini.",

A young defender, with projection and who occupies the left profile. A bet by the merengue sports management to accompany Lakrar and Mar\u00eda M\u00e9ndez, who is playing a fantastic Euro Cup with Spain.\n\nAnderson plays with the Swedish under-19 team and has very good reports about it within Real Madrid. His signing is not yet closed, but it could be done in the coming weeks, as ESPN has learned.",
