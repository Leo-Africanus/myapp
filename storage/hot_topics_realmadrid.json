Let\u2019s see who is brave enough to deliver justice next knowing that they could be next\u2026\u201d\n\nTheir tweet is finished with the hashtag \u2018Stop Referee Harassment Now\u2019, and tags the Royal Spanish Football Federation, La Liga, the Referees Committee and the Ministry for Sport in Spain. The hashtag did not take long to gather numerous tweets.\n\nMeanwhile the Celta Vigo English account also went for their own form of criticism, producing a meme in which the controversial penalty not given against Real Madrid in their Copa del Rey tie was pictured, a game for which Munuera Montero was also in charge. On Tuesday, Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti doubled down saying that \u2018Referees had harmed\u2019 Los Blancos, while Fede Valverde initially empathised with referees, before releasing a statement explaining why he didn\u2019t criticise officials when asked about them.",

        "content": "I really think our last ten years have been shaped by that crazy 9248 goal in the 2014 Champions League final. Think about it, if Atl\u00e9tico had won that one, who knows what would have happened at Real Madrid? The whole club could have gone in a totally different direction. Our success since then has been about that never-say-die attitude, those late winners, and the sheer belief the guys have had. Now everyone fights for every ball. Before 2014, it felt like some of our players just kind of accepted losing to European teams. As a Madridista since 2005, I've seen it all. And it's awesome that some of the legends from that 2014 team are still around, showing the young guys how to win those big games.",
