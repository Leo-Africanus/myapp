        "content": "I decided to rewatch mbappe matches again including past matches where he played teams like madrid.  Something I noticed that I didn\u2019t see before.  I want to address what I think is the main problem of why he has been playing badly.\n\nHis dribbling and passing is off I concluded is because he is in a new team and is not feeling comfortable.  After d1 in college I didn\u2019t touch the ball for 2 years and one day decided to play a pick up game.  It was with people I didn\u2019t know and everyone was wearing the same color shirt.  When I got the ball I didn\u2019t know what to do or where to dribble, that along with the fact that I haven\u2019t touch the ball in years.  \n\nPeople including me said that he doesn\u2019t look like he care or is passionate even after making many mistakes.  Just rewatching a lot of past matches , I can tell you he does care but expressed it differently.  Every player is different.  Some players get frustrated at their mistakes and in that frustration makes even more mistakes.  I think mbappe is a player where if he makes a mistake, he moves on and try again and doesn\u2019t let it get to him.  \n\nThe passing and dribbling and scoring will come and we will see the real mbappe once he is comfortable and builds good chemistry with everyone on the team.  I noticed that he gets very nervous in 1v1 situations with the goal keeper.  He cares from just rewatching and keeping tab of his expressions.  \n\nUntil then we all need to be patience with Mbappe.  It\u2019s not him being out of form or depress.  That\u2019s what I thought and it pisses me off for a few months of the way he is playing.  So I decided to take a deeper look to really see what the problem is as he is not injured or anything. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/yjDygjR5DWM?si=WeavxU4tAGJ3kFJV",

He would defend, whip long balls and passes and would dictate our attack all simultaneously.\n\nBut now that he's retired, I think we need someone to control our play and Ceballos is the perfect man for that, at least for this season. He has become an essential part of our midfield, especially in our current injury crisis and is proving his worth to Madrid.\n\nAs we know TAA is most likely coming here next season and can take up the passing aspect of Kroos's game, while valverde and Cama take up the defending and Bellingol and Ceballos take up the control of the play.\n\nIf we're able to Find a long term solution for Kroos's replacement, then coupled with the fact that vini and Mbappe's (hoping he'll be back to his best by next year) potent attacking and our reserves team's capabilities (brahim, Bobby, Arda, Ramon and the lads from Castilla), we could end up having a treble on our hands by the next 5 years.",
