It is to be noted that Rodrygo has a total of **1937 mins** in appearance for the club and Vini Jr has **2046 mins**. Both have the same number of games started, 22 games.\n\nI'll link the source here for [Vini Jr](https://footystats.org/players/brazil/vinicius-junior) and [Rodrygo](https://footystats.org/players/brazil/rodrygo).   \n  \nWould it make sense to give Rodrygo one more season under a new manager, even if a strong offer comes in this summer? Considering he'll be competing for the wide or forward roles with both Vini Jr. and Mbapp\u00e9, isn\u2019t there a risk that his potential could go to waste if he\u2019s not a guaranteed starter? Especially if the team continues with a narrow 4-4-2 formation? Let's be real the 4-3-3 system with all three forwards starting wasn't a success in any sense as we'd thought it'd be before the season started.",

Yes, he\u2019s incredibly talented and mature for his age, but Mbappe at 17 was already breaking through with Monaco, not a varca. He scored 28 goals and made 16 assists in just 46 games. That\u2019s nearly double Yamal\u2019s goals in less than half the matches. And this wasn\u2019t in a team built around youth development and possession,this was Ligue 1 football. So while Yamal is special, acting like he\u2019s the first of his kind ignores just how elite Mbappe already was back then.",

        "title": "Rodrygo Goes or does he not?",
        "content": "It infuriates me as to how we are just fine with letting Rodrygo leave Real Madrid. We're talking about the man who kisses the badge every fucking time he scores. Do you guys remember when Vini and Rodrygo joined the club? Do you also remember how Vini used to misplace passes, fail dribbles, use flashy skills with 100% fail rate, finish 0/n chances when he was new? At the same time Rodrygo was scoring freekicks against Bayern, a PERFECT hattrick in the UCL at the age of what 18? and was way more promising. He was definitely a better player than Vini and the consequence of being a better footballer than Vini was that his weak foot was much better than Vini's weak foot. After Mariano D\u00edaz and Hazard, when both Vini and Rodrygo had to be accommodated with Benzema, Rodrygo shifted to the right just because he had a better weak foot than Vini. This MAJOR SACRIFICE has led to every single thing now, be it Vini's Ballon D'or shouts, or even being considered Madrid's best. Just think about it, had Vini been playing RW and Rodrygo at LW, y'all would've whistled so hard that Vini would've been the next Vallejo or would've been sold whereas Rodrygo would've been our main man and would've got the ballon d'or shouts (he also has a way better PR). The development that Vini got in these 5 years has been exponentially more than Rodrygo because Rodrygo has been so limited by his position, he's as good as any other professional footballer just starting out when he has to score with his left. This affects his numbers too and obviously confidence. When he leaves and starts playing as a LW, he'll easily become their club legend and retire with much more attention he's been getting now. Just remember, things would've been so different if Rodrygo had stayed stubborn instead of helping the team in anyway possible. No one is CR7 who can contribute everywhere from upfront. This season Rodrygo has been playing better with Mbappe than Vini. Y'all need to remember that if we have one CR7 then we need one Benzema. Rodrygo is the only one of the three upfront who can be Benzema. Either way, we still need him for depth or if one of Vini/Mbappe are suspended or injured. He can be a great sub although I'd much rather see him retire as one of football's best for which he'll have to leave.",

        "content": "With Xabi Alonso likely coming in, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about how we\u2019d actually line up under him. His go-to has been a 3-4-2-1, though lately he\u2019s used a 4-4-1-1 too. But if it\u2019s 3-4-2-1, I don\u2019t know if it suits our squad right now.\n\nVini fits well as the LAM, but Jude on the right \u2014 especially if Rodrygo leaves \u2014 doesn\u2019t seem natural. Mbapp\u00e9 as the 9 in this setup might be a problem too. It\u2019s just not the type of system that plays to his strengths.\n\nMidfield might be our strongest point. Valverde in that Xhaka-like role with Camavinga beside him sounds solid. If we get TAA, he\u2019s a dream fit for RWB. LWB is still a big question mark though \u2014 we don\u2019t really have a proper player for that.\n\nOur biggest issue though is depth in defence. Alaba is done at this level, let\u2019s be honest. Milit\u00e3o\u2019s had two ACL tears in two years (2023 and 2024), so relying on him is risky. R\u00fcdiger leaving is being talked about too \u2014 and that would leave us in a really bad spot.\n\nJoan Mart\u00ednez is still recovering, but there haven\u2019t been many updates on his situation. Right now, we seriously need to sign two proper centre-backs. Someone like Saliba or Dean Huijsen would be ideal \u2014 I know we probably can\u2019t get both, but one of them plus another solid CB is a must.\n\nAnd about G\u00fcler \u2014 we need to be more patient and give him more chances in attacking roles. His quality in finishing and positioning is too valuable to keep using him in deeper roles. With time and trust, he can grow into a real asset further up the pitch.\n\nLooking at everything, I think we\u2019re more likely to go with a 3-5-2 or 4-4-1-1 than stick to a full 3-4-2-1.",

        "content": "I know our first priority should be in CB, LWB, and probably one CM to orchestrate things better, but If Rodrygo leaves, I really feel like we\u2019re gonna need a proper striker in the squad. Right now, we\u2019re missing that classic poacher \u2014 someone who lives in the box and finishes off chances. All our forwards are basically short, and Mbapp\u00e9 isn\u2019t known for his aerial game either.\n\nWith players like TAA coming in, it feels like a waste when we don\u2019t have anyone up front who can actually attack those crosses. We saw it clearly against Arsenal \u2014 so many decent balls into the box and no one there to finish them off. The whole front line just felt limited.\n\nWhat do you think \u2014 should we seriously look for a real striker this summer?",

This is why I appreciate seasons like this\u2014it reveals how many fans are just parasites. They\u2019re bashing Vini, a player who gave his all in previous seasons, until opponents started attacking him outside of football with racism and discrimination simply because he\u2019s from Brazil and doesn\u2019t have a degree. And what did the fans do? They joined in.\n\nI\u2019ve loved this team for 20 years, from the best era of Barca to now, and I\u2019ve never seen our fanbase stoop this low, failing to stand behind their own players",

His current plan is to LEAVE Real Madrid. The destination is still unknown. @radio_marca\n\nRodrygo believes he doesn't get the appreciation he deserves at Real Madrid.

In the last clasico we managed to score from a free kick and a corner, same did inter last night so we should abuse this gameplan. Also their left side is totally dead with balde injured and raphinha back to factory settings mode. I'm honestly looking forward for the upcoming clasico for the win",

        "content": "So a couple days ago I made a survey asking for your opinion about this season disaster. Here are the results \n\n*Some % are over 100 because the voters were allowed to vote multiples options.\n\nThe first question I asked its to review this season out of 5 starts. The results of this question was 2.42. \n\nThe next question was about whose fault is the UCL elimination against Arsenal. This question is realy close, so I think there's not winner at all.\n\nThen I ask wich player/s should RM sell.\n*As I'm stupid af I typed Eduard Mendy intead of Ferland, when I realized I edited it so just sum up the votes and %\n\nAnother question was wich posistion should RM reinforce. I typed the majority of possitions but I added the option to add more. \n\nIn the next question I asked for players to sign this summer transfer window:\n\nHuijsen 34\nTAA 26\nWirtz 10\nVitinha 4\nM. Gutierrez 10\nSaka 3\nBarella\nZubimendi 19\nBastoni 2\nHato\nCarreras 3\nA.
