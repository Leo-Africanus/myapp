        "content": "#FT: CASTILLA 1:0 TALAVERA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#1\u00aa FEDERACI\u00d3N\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:** \n\n1:0 Joan Mart\u00ednez 82'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - kickoff, vamos! \n\n14' - first good chance for Castilla, a 3v2 counter and Y\u00e1\u00f1ez decides to not involve either of his teammates, trying a curled shot into the bottom corner that is much too weak to cause any problems to the keeper \n\n19' - huge chance after a corner, the ball falls in front of Palacios' feet, but his slide tackle-shot gets deflected over the bar - Castilla are dominating hard \n\n29' - first chance for Talavera, their attacker is free in front of Fran, but his shot from a difficult angle is very weak and it is easily saved  \n\nHT - dominant first half by Castilla, who control the possession, but fail to generate clear cut chances so far. Talavera are interrupting the flow of the game with fouls and hoping for chances on the counter\n\n46' - 2nd half underway \n\n49' - challenge by the Talavera coach for a potential red card on Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, who pushed away his man in an attempt to break free - never a red card and that's how the referee sees it as well afzer the review\n\n56' - big chance for David Jim\u00e9nez, who gets put through on the right edge of the box by Palacios after a nice, line breaking pass by Pitarch, but his shot is too central and the keeper can save it \n\n\ud83d\udd04 69' - triple sub by Arbeloa: Aguado, Mesonero and Leiva for Manu Serrano, Thiago Pitarch and Y\u00e1\u00f1ez. Official Castilla comeback for Leiva, first match in over two years for him after Ra\u00fal booted him out\n\n75' - Leiva gets fouled at the edge of the area - the referee gives yellow and a free kick from a good position, but Arbeloa asks for a challenge to see if the foul might've been on the line. But the decision remains as the foul was just outside\n\n78' - and the free kick that follows by Mesonero gets deflected and hits the post! \n\n\u26bd 82' - GOLLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - corner by David Jim\u00e9nez, and Sergio R.. - I mean, Joan Mart\u00ednez flies towards the ball and heads it perfectly into the bottom left corner from the penalty spot! \n\n\ud83d\udd04 89' - Cristian David and Bruno Iglesias on for Manuel \u00c1ngel and Palacios\n\n90'+4 - huge chance on the counter for Castilla, Aguado arrives in the box and squares it back to Mesonero, but his shot is deflected with a last ditch block over the bar for a corner\n\n90'+6 - Castilla much closer to converting a counter for the 2-0 than conceding the equaliser since scoring. 8 minutes of added time\n\nFT - and the final whistle blows, with Castilla getting yet another win, making it 5 in a row in the league. The team patiently and maturely worked their way through Talavera's low block, always remaining in full control of the match. The winner then finally came late with a spectactular header from Joan. The team is in amazing form, not just winning, but always in a dominant and controlling fashion, and are now third, 4 points behind leaders Tenerife\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 18:15 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee**:  Jos\u00e9 Alberto Pardeiro Puente\n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 1, Matchday 10\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[LaLiga+](https://www.laligaplus.laliga.com/) (subscription - 14.99\u20ac/month) (only available in Spain)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-3-3): Fran Gonz\u00e1lez - Manu Serrano (69' Diego Aguado), V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as, Joan Mart\u00ednez, David Jim\u00e9nez - Jorge Cestero, Thiago Pitarch (69' Dani Mesonero), Manuel \u00c1ngel (89' Cristian David) - C\u00e9sar Palacios (89' Bruno Iglesias), Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (69' \u00c1lvaro Leiva)\n\nBench: Sergio Mestre (GK), Guille S\u00fanico (GK), Mario Rivas, Lamini Fati, Pol Fortuny, Gabri Castrelo. \n\nUnavailable: Jes\u00fas Fortea (injury), Roberto Mart\u00edn (injury), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Rachad Fettal (injury). \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** WWWWD\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 5th | 15pt | 5-0-4 | 12:10\n",

        "title": "About Vinicius taking penalties.",
        "content": "This here is one of the reasons why we would probably take two steps forward as a team and 1 step back. Indiscipline. We saw it under Carlo and we are seeing it again. \n\nThis is a footage of Vini just picking up the ball and going for the penalty, He did not ask Mbappe for the penalty. Mbappe is a non confrontational person, and despite being on a hattrick, he let Vini take it. \n\nVini\u2019s penalties even when he scores are terrible, he hits them without any form of technique. Anyone can miss a pen, but some penalties are genuinely bad. If this penalty gimmick continues, it will cost us one day. \n\nThe decision to take the penalty was against the clear instructions of the coach who has made it clear time and time again who the primary taker is. There is no team that makes progress with rebellion and indiscipline.  \n\nThere is still signs of indiscipline in this team and it is obvious where it stems from. \n\nXabi should either put his foot down on many things or the same bad attitude which plagued this team under Carlo Ancelotti will keep repeating itself. It doesn\u2019t matter how many penalties Bayern Munich have and it doesn\u2019t matter how many penalties Kane misses, he continues to take them. This is a clear case of hierarchy and structure.  \n\nFinally, Mbappe is a leader in every sense of the word, his leadership has mostly come from his performances on the pitch and rightly so. His gestures towards teammates have always been with harmonious intentions, but he has to also understand that maintaining harmony cannot happen by contradicting the instructions of the coach who again made it clear in the post match press conference that the designated pk taker is the designated pk taker. \n",

I hope that Xabi keeps it that way, since that is where Valverde shines. This gives space for more players to play in the midfield. Against Valencia, I think we saw our best formation yet. Playing Valverde at right back gives us not only a strong defender, but also someone who has been showing he can pass too. Trent should probably become Valverde\u2019s backup or be played in midfield but I doubt he will play there. ",

        "content": "This one dribble by Endrick is better than anything Franco Mastantuono has shown us this game. With how short Endrick is, and with how good Mbapp\u00e9 is, I think RW is the perfect position for Endrick. Before he goes away on loan, I would love for Xabi to try Endrick at RW rather than at ST.\n\nI like Franco's energy, but he constantly loses the ball, he can't dribble, and he doesn't score goals. Yes, he brings good energy and helps in defense, but that's all. I think that Endrick has more to bring than Franco for now. If it were up to me, I would give Endrick more playing time as an RW than he's being given now.\n\nI'm not saying that Franco should be benched, but how is it fair that Franco gets so much playing time when he's not really delivering all that much? Franco has already had, in the 3 months he's been at the club, more playing time than Endrick has had since he joined Real Madrid 15 months ago. Endrick has scored 7 goals, and Franco just 1. Surely, I'm not the only one who has been thinking about this. **Play Endrick at RW, not at ST.**",

Links or names of YouTube channels or streaming platforms would be awesome!\n\nHala Madrid and thanks in advance.",
