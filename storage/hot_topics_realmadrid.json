He gave him barely any minutes at the Club World Cup, no assuring statements from him during pressers ever, and not once has he hinted that Rodrygo is part of his long term vision. What\u2019s even more confusing is that Rodrygo is pretty much Xabi\u2019s type of player. Low on unnecessary flair and extravagant shehnanigans, high on work rate, pressing discipline, and tactical side. He\u2019s not flashy like some, but as lethal , technical and clinical as they come. I really thought Xabi would be high on Rodrygo but have never got the vibe that Rodrygo is someone he\u2019d pick or build around. Sure, Vini and Mbapp\u00e9 are undisputed starters but that doesn\u2019t justify the brutal sidelining of a player of Rodrygo\u2019s calibre imo.",

I haven't bought a Real Madrid jersey since the Decima and this new kit color is making me buy one, absolute beauty but.... i am confused. I am seeing the authentic vs the other version and the color looks way different.   \n  \nDo they look way different in person? The one the players are modeling is the authentic or replica verion? Because that is the one i want, long sleeve too. Authentic is about $300 for me vs replica $200 so want to be sure. And i don't play, and will barely use it. ",
