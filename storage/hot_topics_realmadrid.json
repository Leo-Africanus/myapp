Yes, we can all see that Vini isn't playing to the levels we got used to and we expect but another way to look at it is that the team isn't over reliant on Vini anymore.\n\nI also hope when Mbappe comes back we still continue to have goals from other players in the squad. For years everything went through Vini as he was the difference maker and we were all crying for someone to relieve the burden and we have that but unfortunately Vinis form has dipped but we shouldn't be happy going from Vini dependent to Mbappe dependent and instead of complaining, you should be happy that even without Mbappe and even with Vini out of form we are still able to win.\n\nThat should be the takeway not fucking bashing our players are every fucking match we win. Seriously mods just allow trash in this sub and its annoying and most of the time there's no analysis, just a post shit talking a player that's representing out club.\n\nPeople wanted Tchouameni out, Valverde out, Rodrygo out, I remember when Curtois joined and he was literally awful for a long time constantly letting shots through his legs, modric started as a bad signing. So many players have gone through periods of bad form its not exclusive to Vini but it should be kept to football only not fucking personal attacks.\n\nIf we sold every player that has a dip in form as people in this sub suggests we would have maybe 2 players left\n",

Most people in this forum page have never played casual football at a decent level, let alone playing at the actual apex.\n\nIn the match thread I saw hundreds of comments calling players names. Most notably, Vinicius Jr was the target of most of the hate. He started off the game on fire and was involved in build up and the high press that was leading to constant turn overs of the ball.\n\nHe had 8 recoveries of the ball and was only dribbled past once. There were many other players on the pitch with less involvement and more moments that caused us to get Punished. We know what Vini is capable of and we should back him.\n\nWe often see rating websites like FotMob be extra harsh on Real Madrid players whilst giving free rating points to a certain player from another team I won\u2019t name. I think those ratings are a reflection of the fan base. Vinincius Jr\u2019s performance today would have received the hate it did if he was another player at any other team. I know Real Madrid has a history of it but not for players like Vini. I think this energy extends to other platforms and players these days are reading comments and are watching people\u2019s reactions. \n\nAnyways, looking forward to a good El Clasico coming up.\n\nHala Madrid!",
