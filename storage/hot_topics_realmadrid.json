He completed four training sessions during the week, but his feelings weren't particularly good.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti decided to include the Brazilian in the squad for the match against Barcelona in an attempt to protect a player who has been very important in the Italian's four seasons in charge of Real Madrid. But since last February, his importance, in terms of his contribution to the game, has disappeared. Curiously, this season began with doubts due to the BMV issue, but he managed to turn things around. However, this time, he wasn't included in the plans during the week of preparation for the match.\n\nRumors and doubts about his future:\n\nThe substitution in the Cup has been a definitive blow to his morale, to which have been added the numerous rumors that have appeared about his future, which has led to a situation that is not to the liking of the footballer.",

        "content": "we need to bring in someone with a personality like ramos. someone who tolerates no nonsense from the likes of vini and mbappe, who will knock sense into them to press consistently. Ramos didn\u2019t just lead by example; he demanded intensity and discipline from everyone, no matter their star power. with mbappe and Vini\u2019s reluctance to press, that kind of figure becomes even more crucial\u2014someone who commands respect and won\u2019t hesitate to call out laziness, egos, or tactical lapses, especially off the ball. To truly balance the locker room and elevate Madrid\u2019s competitive edge, a contrasting personality is required\u2014someone who will not tolerate lapses in concentration or half-hearted pressing. it doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be a player, it can be a mentor or analyst, but i feel like we desperately need it.",

        "content": "I\u2019m sick of us sugar coating this season. We\u2019ve had a horrible year not only winning nothing but losing 3 trophies by directly losing to our rivals in the most embarrassing way.\n\nThen of course not making it to the Semis in the UCL because we got absolutely cooked by a team that turns out wasn\u2019t even that good. We got beat by them so convincingly we somehow made them look like the UCL favorites.\n\nNot only did we win nothing, we played horrible football. The defense is all over the place and while yes we have a lot of injuries it\u2019s not like we\u2019re playing random kids from the streets of Madrid in the back 4, these guys get payed to play the game and performances like this are not acceptable at any top level of football let alone Real Madrid standards. Our attack can have great games but then again let down by the defense while they also miss a lot of chances by over thinking or not thinking enough. \n\nAs much as I love and appreciate Don Carlo he clearly doesn\u2019t have suitable tactics AND/OR the players don\u2019t listen to him and however way it is it\u2019s not a good look. Looks like we\u2019re getting Xabi next season which will be interesting given how different Leverkusen are as a team specially regarding formation.\n\nIn conclusion the team played way below Real Madrid standards, we are allowed to be frustrated over this without comparing ourselves to other teams like Arsenal that won nothing but \u201chad their best season in a while\u201d, we don\u2019t have the same standards and that\u2019s okay.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for change next season and go back to our winning ways.",
