He was fast, he was a good dribbler and his free kicks were top class plus he was the most expensive player at that time when we signed him\n\nSo I had lots of high expectations from him which, ofc bale proved me right, he settled well in real Madrid and linked up really well with Karim and Cristiano. \n\nI love his technical skills and dribbling and his amazing finesse goals and he was also a major part of our team for many years especially when we did 3 UCLs in a row \n\nSo overall my expectations were high and he did delivered and became important part of the squad",

I know we are his dream club but PSG wanted him badly. So Xabi, rates him very highly.\n\nI've been looking at alot of his videos and saw some of the replays of the games where he performed well. Out of all the players we got from SA in the recent years, he is clearly the most ready to get minutes. The other's were not ready and simply prospects but this guy just needs to adapt to the team and league.\n\nSimilar to Yamal. Franco is an agile dribbler who doesnt reply on his physicality like Vini to dribble past people. He also is amazing at link ups and through balls. I noticed alot of times his playmaking was too good for River plate players, where he would do an amazing pass but his teamamtes would not be able to predict the pass and go into space.\n\nWith players like Mbappe, Vini...etc. he wont have this problem.\n\nOut of Arda and Franco. I can see one of them become a CM. Or even both. They are just too good to not play together",

        "content": "I'm not sure why; possibly because\n\n1. Players on the right frequently rotated to the left, whereas players on the left did not get the vibe.\n\n2. The players on the right were responsible for covering Lucas Vasquez.\n\n3. Or simply because we didn't pass to the right very often and had few runs in that direction.\n\nAs a result, players such as Rodrygo and Guler struggled and were frequently almost 'invisible' at times . FEDE had to play much more defensively.\n\n But recently in CWC (I know we mostly played 532), both sides have received the ball more evenly, and goals are no longer coming solely from the left side. I can't speak for our friendly game.partly because i didn't actually \ud83d\ude05 watch it \ud83e\udd26. \n\nHopefully this eye opener can justify  some players underperformances.you can't go crazy when you don't get the ball check out CDR final and how Guler played in RW almost didn't sniff the ball till he got subbed off.",

        "content": "All. Sorry for the bad joke, but now being fr, where he should play? It's hard to define position that would suit him the best. Personally, I think something between 6 and 8. Definitely not classic 6, too many stupid fouls, feels electric on this position. But as a double pivot, someone who just runs, joins attacks, press is just ideal. However, I think that the problems is that he needs some tactical lessons from Xabi, catch some focus, get rid of sloppiness. I also think he has some ADHD (jk), he runs a lot, he is probably amongst one of the most pressing players but I think he should press smarter not harder. I just hope that Xabi will tame this beast, cuz my boy has just so much potential. He also needs to be more present in the attack, everybody remembers his assist to Vini against city right and his goal against city too, right? The only problem I can see is when we will play organised football, when we control, he might struggle, because he is a king of chaos, but he will adjust\ud83d\udcaa I believe in him.\n\nSorry for the chaos and the mistakes if there are any but I'm just like him\ud83d\ude1d",
