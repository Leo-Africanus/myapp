Do they accept cash?\n\nMight be a silly question but, I'm also planning to watch the game by myself as an Asian male. I hope that's okay? I go to hockey games by myself all the time in the US but I've never been to Spain.\n\nI can go the VIP ticket route but would want to spend less than 300 euros. \n\nThank you! ",

        "content": "I just love how simple simple he makes everything look.His short passing is amazing but his long passes in my opinion is the greatest in football history.The guy is so press resistant that I think if I thorw a baseball at his face at full speed the guy would still dodge it.\n\nI think Kroos was the most important player in our squad since 2010 cause when Kroos played well the team played well.Modric is amazing player but for me Kroos was way way more important for Madrid than Modric was.\n\nKroos is 3rd greatest midfielder of all-time for me with Zizou at 1 and Xavi at 2.\n\nWhile among real Madrid players he is 3rd for me behind only CR7 at 1 and Zizou at 2.\n\nHow much I miss Kroos in real Madrid shirt can't be said with simple word",

        "content": "I watched some analysis of YouTubers about how real Madrid could play in the future one thing they showed in your video about our CWC performance of each player he showed that when we were using 3-5-2 formation Guler would sometimes stay deeper while Valverde  went upper in the pitch to attack while guler played as the lone CDM or sometimes he even moved to the cb position when Tchoumeni moved up to attack.\n\nIt showed how tactically brilliant Xabi truly is he can bring the best out of any player.\n\nAnd sometimes valverde would be aggressively attacking.\n\nAnd yes for anyone saying about the PSG game I am happy that our players got that trashing in that game because it was a good wake up call that they need to put 100% in every single game no matter what.\n\nAnd I think that ass whooping was necessary.\n\nAnd I'm happy that the team got it before the start of the season",
