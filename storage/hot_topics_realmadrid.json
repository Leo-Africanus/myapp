Meanwhile there has been multiple occasions where Madrid played just like this. 2-1 vs Barca, 3-0 vs Bilbao, 6-1 vs Monaco. \n\nThe reasons why Madrid \u201clook better\u201d are as follows:\n\n1. Sociedad isn\u2019t a low block team. Madrid historically always play better against teams that don\u2019t sit in a low block even if that means they lose sometimes (against city this season for example)\n\n2. Second and most importantly Trent Alexander Arnold. His passing ability is something Madrid desperately needs. His cross field passes, through balls through defensive lines opens up so much more for Madrid. \n\n3. Mbappe and vini payed for dinner. This one is obviously a joke but an act like that from two of the main stars can go a long way. So from now on they must pay for dinner before every game. They will also have to pay for breakfast on UCL nights. ",

Both made runs forward but I loved seeing Valverde make runs and cover defensively while Trent was able to playmaker and put an absolute passing masterclass. I think regardless of our formation as long as they're fit they should play together on the right flank or right back right cdm position and seemed to balance each other incredibly well.",

        "content": "I haven't followed the sub for a while, but I haven't seen anyone mention it, so I'm doing it now. \n\nArbeloa is a defensive coach; we've conceded far fewer scoring opportunities since he arrived. \n\nHe is obviously limited tactically, he's not a genius, and he will be beaten tactically by the best coaches in the world.But the individual quality of the team could make the difference. He's a good coach for a great team  \n\nI hope we will be put in difficulty quickly and often so that he can prepare solutions to his tactical problems. I think he's capable of it because apparently it's defense that wins tournaments. \n\n\nHis work to avoid two/three takes on Vini is incredible too.\nAnd when I talk about tactical limitations, I mean in the build-up play from the goalkeeper; the opposing coach adapted, and there didn't seem to be a real plan B, let alone a plan C.",
