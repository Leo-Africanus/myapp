        "content": "I feel like I'm going insane hearing how much some of you blame Carlo for things that arent even in his job description.\n\nThe manager's job is to make sure the players made available to him are doing what he wants them to do on the pitch to win.\n\nThe medical staff's jobs are to inform the manager of the player's physical condition and how much they should be allowed to train and play depending on their condition.\n\nIf a player comes back from an injury and plays our next game and gets injured, questions must be asked of the medical staff as to why he was recommended for selection. You can blame Carlo if you have proof that they did advise the player not to play but Carlo didn't listen.\n\nDo you understand how insane some of you sound? His job is \"Manager\", not \"Doctor\".",
