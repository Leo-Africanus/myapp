        "content": "We know Asencio hasn\u2019t had a great Club World Cup so far. In the first game against Al Hilal, he gave away a silly penalty, it was questionable, but still unnecessary. Then in the second game vs Pachuca, he grabbed Rond\u00f3n\u2019s shirt as the last man outside the box, which got him sent off. Two bad decisions, both a bit questionable, but still avoidable. No excuses.\n\nBut come on, don\u2019t forget what he\u2019s done this season in such a short period of time.\n\nWhen Milit\u00e3o got injured in 2024, Asencio stepped up big time. He had a great season, was solid in defense, and became one of the best surprises of the year. He showed real quality and maturity.\n\nAnd now some people want to turn their backs on him after just two bad games? That\u2019s not fair.\n\nRemember, the best Varane messed up on two goals against City that cost us a UCL knockout. Sergio Ramos is the most sent-off player in Madrid\u2019s history. Sanch\u00eds made the back pass in Tenerife\u2026 Even the greatest make mistakes, and that doesn\u2019t make them any less great.\n\nAsencio is a solid CB. In this short time, he\u2019s shown real potential and could become an important player for Real Madrid. Let\u2019s have patience and hope for the best\n\nHala Madrid.",

        "content": "Greetings to all football fans, especially admirers of Real Madrid! I have a burning question, and I hope that experienced fans, perhaps even those residing in Philadelphia, can shed some light on this topic. As we know, the legendary club Real Madrid recently visited Philadelphia, and I'm plagued by curiosity to know exactly which hotel the star players stayed at.\n\nThe thing is, I'm staying at the luxurious Four Seasons hotel, and I'd like to take advantage of this great opportunity to cross paths with the team, maybe even get a coveted photo or autograph. That would be an unforgettable moment for me as a devoted Real fan.\n\nTherefore, if anyone has information about the exact location of the team in Philadelphia, I would be immensely grateful for that information. I understand that privacy is important, but any clue, even the slightest, could point me in the right direction.\n\nIn addition, I'm interested in the question of timing, namely, how many hours before the start of the match does Real Madrid usually leave the hotel to get to the stadium. I heard that in Charlotte the team left the hotel about four hours before the game, but I'd like to know if this is standard practice.\n\nIf anyone attended the Real match in Charlotte, please share your experience. Your information will be invaluable in planning my meeting with the team in Philadelphia. I understand that the team's schedule can be very tight, but I'm willing to make every effort to increase my chances of meeting my football idols.\n\nI'm sure many Real fans share my desire to see their heroes up close. Therefore, let's join forces and share any useful information that will help make this dream come true. Thank you in advance for your help and support! Hala Madrid!",

        "content": "What is the single, most Improved player you guys have witnessed in a Real Madrid shirt?\n\nThis can be from any era, but I'm specifically asking for you to list players you have witnessed improving. The improvement could have started at another club as well, especially if they were loaned out and returned to Real. The improvement of growth need not to have happened specifically at Real as long as that player ends up playing for Real Madrid.\n\nFor me personally it has to be Vinicious Jr.\n\nWhen I compare to the way he played when he just arrived, how horrible his decision making was, how he couldn't even finish at all. The goals he scored early on were mostly flukes, and deflections.\n\nI couldn't have even dreamt at that point how much he would improve within a couple of years. He went from a colossus joke to deserving to be called the best player on the planet in 2024.",
