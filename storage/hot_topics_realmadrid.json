        "content": "Offensively :\n\nVinicius created space for himself in between 2 defenders with his dribbling and went for the shot and scored, seems like his confidence is back and he is regaining form. Any player in that spot would have normally passed it , he didnt. While this might be a sign of reckless decision making to some , he seems to have regained confidence in his finishing.\n\nMbappe didnt score or assist , but thats okay. As a striker , he created several chances for the team and he was a constant threat in the box. ( he seemed pretty frustrated with that offside call , cant really blame him for that , la liga offside is never much understandble when the match in going on)\n\nMastantuono didnt do much in this match but this is to be expected , the pace of gameplay in la liga is more than that in the argentinian league , he will need time to adapt. Mbappe himself took like 2 - 3 months to fully adapt from ligue 1 to la liga gameplay , similar time frame will probably be needed by franco as well to see his best performance.\n\nArda guler played pretty well today. Mallorca defense was pretty shaky and guler almost got 2 goals , 1 got cancelled because of foul play during scoring , but he still performed pretty well in the cam spot.\n\nAlso , our pressing was pretty good today , that mainly helped vini get the ball and score.\n\nDefensively :\n\nI aint gonna lie , we would have conceded 2 extra goals today because of loose defending , carreras and trent saved us today with their last second defensive performances in dire situations.\n\nConceding from the corner , not much concerning cause Muriqi is a classic target man , he is good in scoring from aerial situations.\n\nI must say trent doing what we feared he cant do \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23. None of us expected him to defend. Also , Huijsen has been pretty good , taking care of most aerial duels and also being in good positions to intercept the ball. Militao was also pretty good today.\n\nOverall , today , our defense mostly relied on miracles , but thats what real madrid , Miracles are inbuilt into the system (seriously didnt expect carreras to do an acrobatic clearance like that).\n\nHala Madrid !!",
