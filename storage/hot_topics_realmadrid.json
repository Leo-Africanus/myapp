They act like they're fighting against the whole world. MFs are the BIGGEST Gaslighters in world football. The whole football community needs to do something about these thieves.\n\nHere is La Liga's statement:\nhttps://www.laliga.com/en-ES/news/official-statement-with-respect-to-the-corporate-operation-related-to-vip-boxes-as-communicated-to-laliga-by-fc-barcelona\n\nAnd Here is Barcelona's president gaslighting the world:\nhttps://x.com/FabrizioRomano/status/1907419053318168873?t=x1GLPrDG78SsZBgLy5MPrw&amp;s=19",

        "content": "I understand the last two times round we've been thrashed by Barcelona but there were critical squad issues that hadn't yet been resolved. Firstly, Tchouameni was struggling heavily to adapt to CB (we hadn't yet discovered Asencio), Vasquez started at RB (we hadn't yet played Fede in that position) and we were still kind of poor on giving Fran Garcia minutes. \n\nI think with starting the same team we started against Manchester City, bar Dani and Mendy of course, we actually have a solid chance of winning this thing. I've seen a lot of Madrid fans with a big lack of faith every time we play against Barcelona or even for the Arsenal match next week. Madrid is the best club in the world by a large margin. We are obliged to win every final. With the new discoveries to our lineup this game can be won, as can all the rest.\n\nDon't even talk to me about yesterday either by the way. Vasquez starts again, Alaba shouldn't have even been on the pitch and Camavinga out of position. Oversight by Carlo, but this Barcelona game is ours to lose if our starting XI is as it should be.\n\nHala Madrid, Vamossss!!!",

Yea I know his strategies has not been working this season even I am frustrated with him, but we have such huge egos to handle and there aren't many who can do that. Remember what happened to man United after sir Alex left. Respect carlo he has given us enough for him to decide when to leave.",
