        "content": "Hello everyone. I\u2019m not sure if this questions has been asked before. I want to know who chooses the targets. Is it Purely the Coach ? or is it Perez ? Or is it Perez / Calafat / Jose Angel Sanchez together . The point is I want to know if the board decides the players and the coach has to work with them or if the coach requests certain players specifically and the requests will be approved . My opinions is that the coach has not much say in big signings like Mbappe / Bellingham / TAA etc. But the coach might request for less expensive players which will be evaluated and approved by the board.",
