        "title": "[Match Thread] Southampton FC U21s - Real Madrid Castilla | U21 Premier League International Cup, Group Stage, Matchday 2",
        "content": "#FT: SOUTHAMPTON 1:1 CASTILLA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#PREMIER LEAGUE INTERNATIONAL CUP\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:** \n\n0:1 Thiago Pitarch 76'\n\n1:1 Lekan Okunola 90'+4 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - kickoff, vamos! \n\n\ud83d\udd04 10' - Fortea leaves the pitch supported by the medical team, he has an ankle injury after a Southampton player stepped on his foot - hopefully it's nothing too grave. Manu Serrano comes on for him\n\n20' - penalty not given for a foul on Y\u00e1\u00f1ez in the box\n\n33' - now a yellow for a dive in the box for Y\u00e1\u00f1ez - it wasn't a penalty but it was never a dive either. Castilla dominating and pushing hard for the first goal here \n\n35' - now the best chance of the game is Southampton's on the counter. In the end it's a 3v1 situation on the goalkeeper, but the final pass is so bad, it forces their attacker to take a shot from a very tight angle, that Mestre can save nicely\n\n45' - huge chance for Castilla, Mesonero advances at the right side of the box and puts it inside - \u00c1lvaro let's it pass through with a nice dummy for Y\u00e1\u00f1ez, who tries a precise shot, but it goes just wideif the box\n\n45'+1 - Lamini needs treatment after a bad elbow by a Southampton player that could've been a red card if the referee saw it. He is bleeding from his nose, but he can continue\n\n45'+4 - another clear stomp that should've been an easy yellow card for Southampton - English referee doing the job for the English home team here \n\nHT - half time in an even match - Castilla have more of the ball, but Southampton are dangerous on the counter. The game is also pretty physical, with the referee sadly not applying the same criteria for both teams here\n\n46' - 2nd halfway\n\n52' - quadruple chance for Castilla, first Mesoneros shot is blocked, then Bruno's shot on the following corner goes over the bar. One or two minutes later, Y\u00e1\u00f1ez' low curled shot goes just wide, and in the next play, Manu Serrano's shot is saved by the keeper\n\n60' - suffocating dominance by Castilla now - Mesonero's curled shot is nicely saved by the keeper\n\n\ud83d\udd04 61' - Leiva on for Castrelo. His first match for Castilla, although unofficial, since the 2022/23 season \n\n63' - Y\u00e1\u00f1ez' weak footed shot from a pretty tight angle is too central and the keeper can save it again. The goal needs to start arriving soon\n\n68' - Y\u00e1\u00f1ez arrives after Bruno redirects a chipped pass further into the box. His volley is well wide, yet another missed chance by him. Castilla have had enough chances for 3-4 goals here by now\n\n\ud83d\udd04 69' - last subs, and Arbeloa unearths his gems - Manuel \u00c1ngel, C\u00e9sar Palacios and Thiago Pitarch on for Mesonero, Gin\u00e9s and Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez\n\n\u26bd 76' - GOLLLL DEL CASTILLA - corner from the right side - the ball gets played short, then all the way to the left to Leiva, he plays it to Bruno, who plays it into the box to Palacios. He lays it off with a flick to Pitarch, who curls it in nicely into the bottom right corner for the lead that was well overdue\n\n88' - HUGE SAVE by Mestre - Mestre's pass to open the buildup is too long for Manuel \u00c1ngel to reach. Castilla get caught off guard and one pass is enough to put their striker through with only Rivas in front of him. He wiggles past him to take a well placed shot, but Mestre's foot darts out to direct it wide of the goal\n\n90'+2 - and another big chance for Castilla, this time it's Leiva, who is through on the right wing and tries to surprise the keeper with a low shot at the near post, but it hits the side netting \n\n\u26bd 90'+4 - unbelievable. Last kick of the game is a corner, and it reaches Southampton's keeper. His header is great, but Mestre's save is even better and he manages to squeeze it against the bar and out with his glove. The ball falls right in front of Okunola, who heads it into the net on the ground\n\nFT - an incredibly frustrating and unjust result for Castilla, who dominated practically the entire match and even more so in the second half, but did not take their chances well enough to generate a result that mirrored their dominance. Southampton only arrived twice at the end of the game and tied the game after an unlikely goalkeeper header in the dying minutes. Castilla now 2nd in the group table behind Wolves, who played one more match however\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 20:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** St. Mary's Stadium, Southampton\n\n**Referee**: Ross Martin (ENG) \n\n**Competition:** U21 Premier League International Cup, Group Stage\n\n**Viewing options:** [RMTV/RM Play](https://play.realmadrid.com/live/237284)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (5-2-3): Sergio Mestre - Diego Aguado, Lamini Fati, Mario Rivas, Jes\u00fas Fortea (10' Manu Serrano)- Cristian David, Bruno Iglesias, Dani Mesonero (69' Manuel \u00c1ngel) - Gabri Castrelo (61' \u00c1lvaro Leiva), \u00c1lvaro Gin\u00e9s (69' C\u00e9sar Palacios), Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (69' Thiago Pitarch)\n\nBench: Guille S\u00fanico (GK), Pol Fortuny.\n\nUnavailable: Fran Gonz\u00e1lez (rested), Joan Mart\u00ednez (rested), David Jim\u00e9nez (rested), Victor Valdepe\u00f1as (rested), Jorge Cestero (rested), Roberto Mart\u00edn (injury), Hugo de Llanos (injured), Rachad Fettal (injured), Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga (rested). \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** LWWWW\n\n**PL International Cup stats:** 2nd | 3pt | 1-0-0 | 1:0\n\n",

Pagar x4 lo que cuesta un boleto en StubHub es algo de locos. \n\nLlevo desde el d\u00eda que salieron los boletos al p\u00fablico intentando comprar dos desde la p\u00e1gina oficial sin tener suerte. Tengo meses planeando, entraba diario a la p\u00e1gina para ver si ya estaban en venta, llegu\u00e9 hasta escoger boletos para el partido de Champions vs la Juve y hab\u00eda disponibilidad. \n\nHay alguna rivalidad fuere vs Valencia que haga imposible conseguir los boletos?\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBuying tickets is a nightmare for tourists who are not members, I imagine it is the same for people who live in Madrid.\n\nMy question is, is there any group that buys/sells tickets? Paying x4 what a ticket costs on StubHub is crazy.\n\nI've been trying to buy two from the official website since the day the tickets came out without any luck. I have been planning for months, I entered the page daily to see if they were already on sale, I got to choose tickets for the Champions vs Juve match and there was availability.\n\nIs there any rivalry between Valencia that makes it impossible to get the tickets?",

        "content": "The majority of people at this point have noticed how much the Mbappe-Guler duo is reminiscent of Ronaldo-Ozil, but the deeper I look into the squad, the more it reminds me of the Mourinho era. Some fans have also noted that Alonso perhaps has a few more Mourinho-type traits than Ancelotti-type.\n\nI noticed as well that a lot of times this season, our lineup is being displayed as a 4-2-3-1 rather than a 4-3-3. It\u2019s a very subtle difference, but that\u2019s how it was displayed under Mourinho.\n\nHere are all the connections I\u2019ve made:\n\n**Attacking Parallels**\n\nMbappe - Ronaldo (main goalscorer)\n\nVinicius - Benzema (the sidekick)\n\nRodrygo - Higuain (fighting sidekick for minutes)\n\nMastantuono - Di Maria (right-sided Argentine)\n\nBrahim - Callejon (reliable Spanish backup)\n\n**Midfield Parallels**\n\nGuler - Ozil (Arda literally feels like a regen)\n\nBellingham - Kaka (not overly similar but didn\u2019t want to exclude them for the sake of squad depth emphasis)\n\nTchouameni - Alonso himself (again, same idea as Bellingham - Kaka)\n\nValverde - Khedira (this is borderline disrespectful to Fede but still sorta makes a bit of sense?)\n\nCamavinga - Diarra (versatile French workhorse)\n\nCeballos - Granero (reliable Spanish backup)\n\n**Defensive Parallels**\n\nCarvajal - Arbeloa (seasoned RB)\n\nHuijsen - Ramos (ball-playing CB)\n\nMilitao - Varane (agile CB)\n\nRudiger - Pepe (roughhouse CB)\n\nAlaba - Carvalho (seasoned CB)\n\nAsencio - Albiol (Spanish CB)\n\nCarreras - Marcelo (not overly similar)\n\nFran/Mendy - Coentrao (backup LB)\n\nCourtois - Casillas (world class GK)\n\nLunin - Adan (backup GK)\n\nRemainders: Trent, Gonzalo, Endrick, Sahin, Altintop\n\nThere\u2019s reason to believe that 11/12 was Xabi\u2019s favourite season that he played for us. Is it a stretch to believe he\u2019s trying to emulate it? It\u2019s also worth considering that this was the last season before now that we didn\u2019t have Modric in our squad, who obviously had a colossal impact on the way we play.",

        "content": "We all knew how good tcho is same with camavinga. I had my concerns after a long time away from the field because of serious injuries. But man did these two provide balance. Belli and Guler have the freedom to room preferably to the right side since thats most definitely our weakest offensive side. \n\nWe also knew huujsen is good especially on the ball at least I did before the signing. I was advocating for another center back in that same transfer window even though knowing madrids transfer strategy that was impossible.  I wasn\u2019t expecting these sort of performances from him but Militao 2 acls later and still the same spirit and absolutely serviceable back next to huujsen. I do still believe we do need a center back, one is great at winning aerial duels and that aggression leadership and no bullshit similar to ramos but for now militao\u2019s a very pleasant surprise. (I say this because the multiple serious injuries he\u2019s come back from- also get rid of alaba lol) (main candidates for new cb next year are honestly either one of the two arsenal center backs lol) The reason I say that is I think that is the piece that will elevate madrid to dominate every competition every year and restart that dynasty. militao would be a world class backup in case anything happens to either starter.\n\n\nBack to the point, even though I don\u2019t really believe a midfielder is a priority especially since we have too many of them and we haven\u2019t even gotten into valverde and how as it seems his best position for the squad is at rb. (not his best positon overall) he provides his workrate energy and defense there which allows us to have tcho and camavinga both start which covers a lot more of our of the defensive struggles and allows guys like guler and  belli to roam and provide.\n\n\nVini- criticized for his antics and lack of press. I wouldn\u2019t say he has stopped his antics really maybe lessened lol. But watch the last 5/6 games closely he is actually determined to press and most noticeably in the barca game. Vini with a chip on his shoulder or with a child from the other team talking shit lights a fire in him and gives us him best version. Like or not the best vini is the one with that fire lit.",

        "content": "With Liverpool's loss to Crystal Palace 3-0 yesterday and crashing out of the EFL Cup, I personally think they will have a point to prove. Haven't watched them play much this year apart from the Arsenal match at the start of the season (which they won 1-0), the ATM match in UCL (which they also won 3-2), and the United match couple of weeks back (which they lost 2-1). Watched the highlights of the Frankfurt game and tbh, while they played well, Frankfurt was horrendous. \n\nI definitely don't think it will be an easy match specially since it's an away match for us. The Anfield crowd will make it tough and Liverpool will have a definite point to prove (and would do so) if they are able to defeat Real Madrid. \n\nLet's hope we play with the same intensity and don't take it lightly. Also it will be a homecoming for Trent and Xabi. \u2764",
