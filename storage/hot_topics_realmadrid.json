        "content": "Rodrygo is a world class player. His dribbling is phenomenal, his passing is good, his work rate is unbelievable it\u2019s close to or on par with Valverde\u2026 \n\nThere are only 2 negatives to his game:\n1) He sometimes cuts in instead of dribbling down the flank and putting in a cross.\n\n2) His finishing really needs to improve. He doesn\u2019t get as many chances as Vini and Mbappe but when he does he usually misses the target or hits it close to the keeper.\n\nHe had a good 2 months where he was quite accurate and scoring but his shooting is starting to drop again.\n\nI love Rodrygo, he\u2019s my second favourite player behind Jude. I was one of the minority that defended him when people were talking about him being benched or sold when Mbappe arrived at the beginning of the season. Over the season he\u2019s proved himself and I doubt than anyone wants him benched or sold.\n\nBut I could honestly see him winning a Balon D\u2019or if he improved his finishing",
