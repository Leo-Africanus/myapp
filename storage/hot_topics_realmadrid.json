        "title": "Everybody who doesn't support Mbappe in the most difficult time of his career is an antimadridista or just a glory hunter. Supporting him is not a choice, it's an obligation. ",
        "content": "Having watched Madrid for almost 25 years, I have zero doubts that being supportive is the only way to help him overcome his struggles. By ridiculing, laughing and puting him down you are only showing your true nature as supporters (glory hunting nature) and even as human beings. Moreover, you are doing a great disservice to the club you supposedly support. If you wish Real Madrid well you should wish Mbappe well and have his back. Be mature and don't react as spoiled, entitled brats.\n\nEmpathy is the key. Perhaps it's the most important and beautiful skill that any person can develop. Especially, in this case, where it's pretty obvious that Mbappe is struggling mentally.\n\nI've read many silly, rash comments, usually made in the heat of the moment. Sadly, many of them are coming from Real Madrid fanbase. I just hope that mods do their job and don't allow toxicity and veiled insults to mar this place.\n\n**1.** Real Madrid should've bought Kane or Haaland instead. \n\nAt this point, everybody should realize that Mbappe's position is not the problem. There is much more to it. Mbappe in form (before January/February 2024) would be scoring and toying with defenders regardless of his position.\n\n* Oh, here we go again. Where was your Kane when Joselu was knocking Bayern out in that semifinal? I will answer for you. He was missing chances when Rudiger allowed  him to get out of his pocket for a minute or two. Paying over 100m for a 30-year-old is not an answer. It's a path to end up like Barca. Or maybe you are right, Madrid should've bought him and let Bellingham go to City. I bet that would've ended well... for Guardiola. People have very short memory. \n* And don't let me start about Haaland-the most overrated player in recent times. How many bad, average games do you need to understand that he has no quality to be a Real Madrid player? Also, you criticize Mbappe for his attitude (rightly so), but you want to replace him with the Norwegian? He shows less fighting spirit than 37-year-old Luis Suarez. He may look like a quintessential Viking, but he acts like a big softie on the pitch. He had an easy childhood due his father's money, and it reflects in his game.\n* A pure, very talented nr 9 is already here. His name is Endrick.\n\n**2.** Carlo should've taken him off at Anfield. \n\n* No great, top manager would've done it that day. That could've only \"killed\" him for the rest of the season. Fortunately, Carlo is too experienced and intelligent to make a blunder like that.\n\n**3.** Madrid should sell him as soon as possible.\n\n* Sure. Madrid should be planning to sell him in November because some entitled people have patience of a 6-year-old child in a candy store. Yeah, he is finished at 25 without having a serious, debilitating injury. Just like La Liga was finished a month ago for some people. As long as he wants to work and improve, he deserves a chance.\n\nI'm shocked that so many people don't learn from their mistakes. Have you forgotten what happened with Vinicius? Obviously, it's a completely different case in terms of age, status, expectations etc. but the moral of that story should be always prevalent among Madrid fans. Don't write people off, don't jump to conclusions and show support to the end.",

        "content": "Here it is just as we all said.  Endrick needs to go on loan or else he\u2019s going to rot in the bench.  I can see a little bit of how carlitos min works.  Even when mbappe was playing really bad aside from yesterday match.  He keeps playing mbappe as mbappe is already tried and proven.  We all see how good mbappe can be in the past.  I think same thing for Vini, even if vini plays bad for half a season, he will not bench vini cause in his eyes, Vini has already proven himself at madrid and earned a permanent starting place.  How will Endrick be a game changing player if ancelotti doesn\u2019t give him any meaningful minutes to develop?  This is without a doubt a glaring weakness of uncle carlos\n\nhttps://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/carlo-ancelotti-brutal-message-endrick-real-madrid-getafe/blta0714380fedc953e",
