        "content": "#FT: PONFERRADINA 2:3 CASTILLA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#1\u00aa FEDERACI\u00d3N\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:** \n\n0:1 C\u00e9sar Palacios 15'\n\n1:1 Borja Valle 27'\n\n1:2 Manuel \u00c1ngel 51'\n\n2:2 Xemi Fern\u00e1ndez 67'\n\n2:3 C\u00e9sar Palacios 85'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - pretty much a must-win game for Castilla today against relegation zone neighbours Ponferradina, vamos! \n\n\u26bd 15' - GOLLLLLL DEL CASTILLA! - Manuel \u00c1ngel drives forward on the counter, plays it out to Manu Serrano, who squares it in the box to Palacios. He takes a nice touch around the defender, and finishes elegantly, low into the far corner! \n\n\u26bd 27' - the lead did not last long, cross into the box that Rivas can't defend, Manu Serrano then loses the duel and the attacker can lay of the ball to Borja Valle, who can poach it past Navarro due to Rivas still being out of position from the header. There might have been a foul on Y\u00e1\u00f1ez just before the goal, but this absolutely stupid new challenge system doesn't have any clear images (as always), so the referee lets the goal stand\n\nHT - not a very good first half from Castilla, who despite the early lead did not pick up momentum and struggled to regain control after the equaliser\n\n46' - second half underway\n\n\u26bd 51' - GOLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - Manu Serrano drives forward on the left wing and finds an opening for Palacios - he lays it off superbly with the backheel Manuel \u00c1ngel, who takes a touch and finishes it with force past the keeper! Great goal to retake the lead \n\n\u26bd 67' - goal for Ponferradina - a ball gets cleared out to the right wing, and their player puts in a hail mary cross into the crowded box - Xemi takes a great chested touch to take it down and an even better one to finish it nicely into the corner despite the lack of space\n\n\ud83d\udd04 71' - Manu Serrano and Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga off for Valdepe\u00f1as and Gabri Castrelo \n\n\ud83d\udd04 81' - Mesonero makes his Castilla debut and his comeback after his ACL tear in last summer's preseason, he comes on for Roberto Mart\u00edn\n\n\ud83d\udd04 84' - last sub, Bruno Iglesias for Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez\n\n\u26bd 85' - GOLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - great possession play by the team, the ball arrives on the left wing, where Valdepe\u00f1as pulls it back for Palacios. He redirects it goalwards and finishes nicely for the third lead of the match! \n\n90'+1 - a potential penalty is getting checked for a handball in the Castilla box, but out player had their arm close enough by his body and the referee doesn't give it\n\n93' - a potential red card for the Ponferradina player is getting reviewed, after Joan went down for a header and got hit in the face. It stays a yellow card, rightfully so in my opinion \n\nFT - finally Castilla break the streak of 4 losses in a wild match where both teams had phases of control and dangerous possession. In the end, Palacios' great performance with 2 goals and an assist made the difference today, but in general the team showed much more dynamic and precise passing in attack then in the last few matches. Despite the win, Castilla remain in the relegation zone, but with their points doubled and some confidence gained, it was still an immensely important win \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 18:30 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio El Toral\u00edn, Ponferrada\n\n**Referee**: Manuel Garc\u00eda G\u00f3mez \n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 1, Matchday 6\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[LaLiga+](https://www.laligaplus.laliga.com/) (subscription - 14.99\u20ac/month) (only available in Spain)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-3-3): Javi Navarro - Manu Serrano (71' V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as), Mario Rivas, Joan Mart\u00ednez, David Jim\u00e9nez - Jorge Cestero, Manuel \u00c1ngel, Roberto Mart\u00edn (81' Dani Mesonero) - C\u00e9sar Palacios, Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga (71' Gabri Castrelo), Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (84' Bruno Iglesias) \n\nBench: Guille S\u00fanico (GK), \u00c1lvaro Lezcano, Pol Fortuny. \n\nUnavailable: Fran Gonz\u00e1lez (U20 World Cup), Sergio Mestre (first team call-up), Diego Aguado (U20 World Cup), Lamini Fati (suspended), Jes\u00fas Fortea (U20 World Cup), Cristian David (U20 World Cup), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Rachad Fettal (injury). \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** WLLLL\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 18th | 3pt | 1-0-4 | 3:7\n",

        "content": "  This is not a \u201cI miss you Ancelotti\u201d kind of post. I am very happy with what Xabi has been doing. I just wanna point out that Ancelotti knew what he was doing more than we knew. One of the major problems right now is that we don\u2019t have that much players that fit the profile Xabi needs. On the other sides, some players like Guler are fitting in perfectly. Ancelotti never played him since it didn\u2019t fit his tactics. Ancelotti played a counter attacking game, which led to many saying he had no tactics. The whole point of his style was giving free movement to his players and focusing on countering. Even I thought that he didn\u2019t have much tactics. However, I think he understood the type of players Madrid had and hence chose to play like that. If you notice, even now, we play better on the counter and fast attacks. Xabi ball has been great but has some flaws since we do not have much creative players, this was seen against Atl\u00e9tico, or momentarily against other teams. I hope Xabi can make things work, and now I understand why Ancelotti was a pretty good coach overall. ",

While he created chance.\n\nFede doesn't work as DM, he should switch position with Guler to play Right midfielder, that's his best position.\n\nJude had some good moment but obviously he hasn't recovered to his best form yet.\n\nAnd after the changes it's just total mess.",

This is higher than for example semenyo at Bournemouth. \n\nWhy are we not talking how an 18 year old on his first season in Europe is having a higher xg +Xa per 90 then a highly sought after winger in his prime also .29 Xgot per 90 means his shooting is more polished then vini\u2019s at the same time \u2026 this is preety good ",
