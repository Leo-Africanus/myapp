And the funny thing is that the excuses fans now make for Rodrygo were never once brought up for Gareth Bale: \u201cOh, he\u2019s not playing in his preferred position\u2026 Oh, he\u2019s overshadowed because of Ronaldo and Benzema\u2026 Oh, he doesn\u2019t get special treatment like the other stars of the team.\u201d\n\nRodrygo will live long on the memory of what he did against Man City and Chelsea. But let\u2019s remember that this man (Bale) contributed with goals in three Champions League finals and yet never received even a fraction of the sympathy, media support, or fan backing that Rodrygo gets today.",

        "content": "Growing up I've always felt RM had one of the most secure dressing room maybe along with Bayern. Very little controversies or media stories. Even during the Barca treble years there was absolutely reports of unrest. RM have always been one of the most media secure football clubs as far as I've known. But what's changed now?\n\nWe're literally top of the table. Have 2 defeats in the season till now with 2 draws. How is there so much unrest? How is Alonso's job at risk? We've got the best defence in the league &amp; 3rd best in UCL. Coming to Alonso. Is he making mistakes? Yes. Are some of his decisons highly questionable? 100%. But that's what you get with a manager with 2+1/2 seasons of senior management. HE WILL MAKE MISTAKES! THAT IS WHAT YOU GET WITH A YOUNG MANAGER.\n\nArteta took time. Kompany literally got relegated. You have to give him the headroom to learn from his mistakes instead of sack threats. Are we not allowed a transition? Are we not alloed a rebuild phase? Plus its a well known fact that we had an incomplete transfer window!\n\nComing to the dressing room. I feel so sad. Bunch of primadonnas. How have you had your head so up your arse as to not renew your contract cause the manager is rotating you? Its his job ffs! His job is create tactics &amp; win &amp; your job is to play the way he wants! These massive egos will ruin the club. I really believed these issues would never appear at RM.\n\nFreaking Cristiano was let go due to these issues. Who do these players think they are?           \n\nI miss Sergio Ramos in times like this. \n\nPS - I'm not defending Alonso but he's exactly what you're gonna get with a young manager. You have to accep his vision. ",

If they get their way again, what manager can realistically succeed here?\n\nDo people seriously think Arteta, Lucho, Conte or anyone of that calibre would be a good fit for these players?

When this was not accepted, the club asked the player\u2019s side to propose a figure.\n\nVinicius Jr\u2019s representatives requested a historic contract, in the region of the highest ever at the club (which was given to Cristiano Ronaldo), with a package of up to \u20ac30million per season.

It\u2019s not shocking coming from Vini, but it is disappointing to see someone like Valverde, a captain, fall into the same pattern, projecting his poor form onto the coach instead of taking responsibility.\n\nI\u2019m not saying Xabi is necessarily the perfect fit, but he\u2019s clearly addressing the main structural issues we carried over from last season. The club cannot bend to players\u2019 whims; even Ronaldo \u2014 arguably the greatest in our history \u2014 was shown the door when he tried to strong-arm the club.\n\nThis is precisely the moment to reaffirm that principle.

Xabi Alonso understood this culture when he joined, adapting to the reality that Madrid is not just a team, but a global institution. To suggest that Real Madrid would willingly sell off all its star players is absurd, because the club\u2019s financial model and prestige depend on showcasing elite talent.

Look at some of the quality we lost since those three left: No Aerial threats, our set pieces have gone down the gutter, inconsistent forwards, midfield now lacks a technical player that isn't afraid of the ball, our defense is trash, our right side is completely dead without Carvajal, the bench is full of average players mixed in with young players who wont get chances to play (We have two strikers rotting on the bench) and most importantly we lost our mentality. The only reliable position we have is goalkeeping and thats because its courtois and we have a very good backup in lunin. The squad planning since the departure of Benzema has been questionable to say the least and those two ucl wins glossed over the issues which we are now facing. \n\nI know I'm going to get downvoted just because of what I said but at this point I don't really care. We have become an average team and unless these players start to play for the club and not themselves, we will remain average and no coach is going to fix this doesn't matter if its carlo, xabi or zidane.",

        "content": "First of all, Asencio was having a great game and then he did this madness sadly, so that was mainly his fault, also huijsen really didn't help him out. Second, seeing valverde out of all people decide to jog back and then eventually just stop moving is shocking. For example, if this was Barca, at least one of their midfielders would have been fighting for their lives getting back to help the defense, yet our captain that's only been on the field for 20 minutes just stops moving. I'm not trying to put the blame on him alone, my whole point is that the lack of effort from ALL of these players except for Guler, Jude, Asencio ( yes he gave them that 2nd goal but before that he was one of the only players that looked like he actually cared), and Gonzalo of course. This is another benefit of having academy players btw, because they fight like their lives depend on it. I rather see someone from the academy on the field instead of Ceballos for example, who wanted to leave a few months ago. Anyway, hopefully we see some positive changes in the future.",

        "content": " [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qyqeeAALUM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qyqeeAALUM)\n\nJust watched a video with all of Benzema and Ronaldo assists to each other. It's like 23 minutes long, which just shows how insane their chemistry together was. Here are some things I noticed:\n\n\\- **Different types of goals:** Both Ronaldo and Benzema scored in so many different ways (longshot, header, tap-in, counterattack, tiki-taka, etc.). They were two very unpredictable attackers, opposite to our current attack.\n\n\\- **90% of the goals had nothing to do with the midfield:** There are so many dumbass people on this sub who complain that our midfield isn't creative enough. If you watch the entire video above, the majority of goals had nothing to do with the midfield. They were just genius link-up play between Ronaldo and Big Benz. A quick one-two, a low cross into the box, a lofted pass. Just two players who knew exactly how to play with each other. \n\n\\- **Benzema sacrificed so much for Ronaldo:** There were several moments in the video where Benzema could have easily scored, but still gave the goal to Ronaldo. He's truly one of the most unselfish superstars I've ever seen. Never cared about statpadding or getting the individual glory. Just focused on making the whole team better. \n\n\\- **Madrid will never find two attackers with such chemistry:** Mbappe might be more talented than Benzema, and Haaland might be just as clinical as Ronaldo, but even if those two played together for us, they would lack the chemistry that Ronaldo had with Big Benz. I'm glad I got to see them play when I was younger because I'll probably never see anything like it ever again. ",

        "content": "Be honest. I remember I was Team Higuain, he just looked more prolific and had helped us a lot during previous years including scoring a league-winning goal. It wasn\u2019t until the game vs Lyon that my opinion of him started to change and I realized that he didn\u2019t have that clutch gene that some forwards have. Of course, Benzema also had some terrible seasons early on his career, but his role in being the one who dropped back and linked with the midfield so that Ronaldo and Bale could score helped us a lot. I honestly didn\u2019t expect Benzema to become such a legendary player in hindsight but I\u2019m glad I was wrong. He became the player we all envisioned him becoming back during his Lyon days, where he was compared to a Ronaldo/Zidane hybrid. Higuain, I think, was never the same after the World Cup final where he choked. I still hold a soft spot for him tho, he was the least talented of the 3 (Gago and Marcelo were the other 2) but I think he carved out a decent career. I don\u2019t think he was a legend, but perhaps a cult hero. Funnily enough, Gago was the one many thought had the highest ceiling of the 3, but alas, injuries stopped him.",
