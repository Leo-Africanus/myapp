He gave him barely any minutes at the Club World Cup, no assuring statements from him during pressers ever, and not once has he hinted that Rodrygo is part of his long term vision. What\u2019s even more confusing is that Rodrygo is pretty much Xabi\u2019s type of player. Low on unnecessary flair and extravagant shehnanigans, high on work rate, pressing discipline, and tactical side. He\u2019s not flashy like some, but as lethal , technical and clinical as they come. I really thought Xabi would be high on Rodrygo but have never got the vibe that Rodrygo is someone he\u2019d pick or build around. Sure, Vini and Mbapp\u00e9 are undisputed starters but that doesn\u2019t justify the brutal sidelining of a player of Rodrygo\u2019s calibre imo.",

        "content": "First off sorry for the quality of this video, couldn't get it downloaded in a better quality.\n\nI felt like sharing a piece of my story and the relationship I have with this goal. In early 2024 I had one of my worst if not the worst periods in my life. I felt like a piece of garbage back then, still not over my ex, not confident in myself. I was seriously considering ending it all, feeling like I couldn't be loved and that nothing could ever bring me joy. In those difficult moments, I couldn't find happiness in anything besides football, more specifically: Real Madrid.\n\nI've been a supporter for almost 11 years at that time. The 23/24 season was going great, almost like Los Blancos wanted me to keep going. Only one loss, great La Liga campaign, and promising UCL performances made waiting for thier games a nightmare. In January I was at my lowest, crying myself to sleep almost every night, feeling disturbed and upset all the time. But as always up to that point in the season I had time to watch Real in the evening. Supercopa might not sound like that much but at that moment every match they played was like a sweet relief for me, a break from cruel reality. And that's what brings me here, to this match and this goal.\n\nReal Madrid vs Atletico Madrid in the supercopa semifinal was a rolercoaster of emotions, going behind early to taking the lead through Ferland Mendy, to Kepa's mistakes that, for a while looked, to be the final blow for us as Atletico went 3-2 up. At that point I didn't really think of it that much, but from the perspective of time, this scoreline could've be my end as another bigger break from Real Madrid matches, the only thing that made me happy, was a giant blow for my already bad attitude.\n\nThen Carvajal scored... just take a look at the video (and yes the polish commentary is also quite sentimental for me). I was overjoyed. Goal scored by team, goal scored by determination. It's poetic for me.\n\nOf course we went on to win this match (through Carvajals cross may I add) and secured the title later that week. It was the first happy moment in weeks for me.\n\nNow over a year and a half later, I'm happy again, I love my life, I love my family and my friends. It's incredible that a spanish right-back putting the ball in the back of the net may have kept me going. Thank you Carvajal, thank you Real Madrid. \n\nPlease check on your friends, family members, mutuals and most importantly yourself. Speak to professionals if you need help. I was lucky enough for a well disposed team to save my life, but it might not be enough for others. Take care and Hala Madrid!",

        "content": "It\u2019s official \u2014 Endrick will be our new number 9. I\u2019m fully behind this decision. Endrick is a prodigy with huge potential, and even though Ancelotti wasn\u2019t bold enough to start him ahead of some underperforming players last season, he still made a big impact in his limited minutes \u2014 even finishing as our top scorer in the Copa del Rey (5 goals). Him and Garc\u00eda could form an incredible partnership for years to come.",

But maybe that also means that Vinicius will be less creative and more decisive. \nI hope Mbappe really improves his long-distance shooting this season, otherwise he's not going to get back to his prime anytime soon. \nAnd it's cool that we trust Garcia, we really needed a REAL number 9\nWe're going to have a great year of football",
