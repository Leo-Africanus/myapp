I went a long time without speaking to anyone. No one knew what I was going through. It was a very difficult time. I wasn't well, either physically or mentally. That was really hard for me. First God, then my family... and Coach Ancelotti helped me get through all that. Carlo helped me a lot. He saw every day that I wasn't well, that I wasn't fit to play, that I couldn't help the team.\"\n\n\"But there was no time to recover because we played every three days, and then you can't stop to solve the problem. He saw that I'm a person and I had real problems. He understood my moment and my complicated situation. He told me: 'Just stay here calmly, you're not fit to play now.' I thanked him and asked to play. But he knew he had to recover the person before the player.\"\n\n\"The important thing was to be in good shape. It was a very difficult time in my life, but now I've overcome everything, I'm okay. Whenever I can, I thank Carletto, his son Davide, and the coaching staff. Everyone helped me, and of course my family. Now I feel nothing but joy, I'm happy, and very motivated to have a great season.\"",

        "content": "What\u2019s going on with Endrick, what do you guys think? I think he didn\u2019t play one minute since Xabi came and is there any reason behind it? In my eyes he wasn\u2019t doing completely bad last season so I don\u2019t understand why he isn\u2019t having a chance at least. He has a lot of talent in finishing, has good pace and he utilizes his body well. Ofc he wasn\u2019t great either but I think he deserves a chance to prove himself. Gonzalo Garcia was great in Club WC but since then he also didn\u2019t catch up on that. Rumors are starting that Endrick is getting sold in January or after the season. \nCan you guys give me your opinion or is there insider information on why Endrick doesn\u2019t play? Should he play or go? Maybe on loan?",

        "content": "I feel like he can play there against weaker teams but when it comes to the strong teams he definitely can't because his pace is nowhere near good enough for it. To me his best postiton is where guler's currently playing, I mean he was even playing there in his most recent argentina game so it makes sense. In big games valverde should probably be our RW, especially against barca because we're going to need pace on that right side, and also his crossing is very good.",
