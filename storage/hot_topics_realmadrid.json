I feel bad for him because he had to go through racism, getting robbed off an award and now his form has dipped. Nonetheless, we can\u2019t just mindlessly support him and act like nothing happens. We can\u2019t just act like he didn\u2019t play horribly this year. But most importantly we can\u2019t ignore his attitude. I have no problem supporting a player during tough times. I would go far and more for Valverde. However, the problem with Vini is his behavior and ego. Vini is asking the club for more money and trying to shine over Mbappe. I think it is pretty evident by this time that Vini and Mbappe don\u2019t work together. If a player wants to be over the club and act un accordingly they can leave no matter who they are. On the other hand Rodrygo may be a worse player than Vini but has always played out of position for the club and been humble. I believe that Vini needs to stop being defended as much as he is. Every true Real Madrid fan knows no one is above the club.",

        "content": "Personally I think our midifled is creative and are being held back by a lazy attack who refuses to make appropriate runs and confuse the defense. Take garcia for example always moving around getting into good positions that\u2019s why he got so many goals. Compared to vini who runs to the wings and Mbappe who stands still instead on constantly making runs and moving around. Not to mention if Dean and Trent aren\u2019t playing passing back to the defense is the same as giving the opposite team possession because they aren\u2019t capable of being calm and passing that ball back. I think midifled creativity and control really isn\u2019t the anywhere near as big of a problem as people think. I think it\u2019s the people surrounding them that needed the most improvement. But we still need stiller not only are we losing Bellingham we lost modric , Kroos, and possibly ceballos so we need depth and even once Jude is back assuming we play 4 mids we will have only 1 CM option of the bench. What are your opinions ? I personally think defense should be our biggest priority ",

        "content": "Just thinking back to that Champions League run in 2021/22 still gives me goosebumps. Honestly, sometimes I sit here and I *still* can't quite believe we pulled it off. Comeback after comeback... it felt like every single round was a movie script that no one would have dared to write because it seemed too unbelievable!\n\nFrom PSG to Chelsea, then that crazy City game, and finally lifting la Decimocuarta against Liverpool, each step felt like climbing a mountain. But our players... they left EVERYTHING on that pitch. They played with a spirit that was just unmatched.\n\nThere were moments where it felt like it was over, done. But this is Real Madrid, and somehow, some way, our boys found that extra gear, that bit of magic, to turn the impossible into reality. The Bernab\u00e9u was a cauldron, a true force of nature pushing the team forward.\n\nThat run wasn't just about winning; it was about the heart, the passion, the never-say-die attitude that defines our club. It\u2019s a reminder of what\u2019s possible when you wear that white shirt and fight until the very last second.\n\nEven now, years later, whenever I think about that incredible journey, it fills me with so much joy and a sense of limitless possibility for Real Madrid. What a team, what a spirit, what a run!",

So is Carreras. \n\n[Among all fullbacks in his league](https://x.com/DataMB_/status/1943720247891997042), he has the most touches, most progressive actions, most passes completed, most forward passes completed, Most progressive passes completed, most accurate passes to final third...etc. Benfica literally played through him. \n\nI don't have this year's stats but last year he dwarfed everyone in his age bracket in [progressive actions](https://x.com/DataMB_/status/1840701634726216192) in the top 7 league. \n\nOn top of all of this, he has experience playing as a CB aswell, we could see him as an LCB in some games too. I can see him transition to a CB like Ramos too.\n\nWe should be very optimistic in regards to our backline, we have a master passer in trent on our RB, A master progressive player in Alvaro on the left and Dean in the middle.

        "content": "99.9% of everyone had written Chelsea off in the final. But if anything has become clear, its that the modern game, for better or worse, requires pressing and physicallity. \n\nLook at what Chelsea did. They pressed from minute 1, the commentators were questioning if they'd run out of gas before 20 minutes and they kept on pressing. \n\nIt worked wonders. PSG, who is the best tiki taki team right now, couldnt even get a pass together. The CBs, MFs and fowards were immeadeatly stifled. They looked like PSG made Madrid look in the previous match.  It shut PSG down completely. They immediately started going to the long ball with no success.  \n\nAnd it paid off. They ran ruckus on the CB/wing backs, thanks also to Sanchez's superb passing and scored on quick turnovers in dangerous positions. They made PSG seem completely normal, average.\n\nWhile watching it, I said, thats completely the opposite of Mbappe and Vini, who barely press. The better or worse part is though, I dont like it. This isnt basketball, this is football. I miss real wings, real number 10s, beatiful dribbling and amazing passes, but alas 2025, and the press rules. If our forwards don't do it, this generation will be wasted.\n\nThis is not a drama post, or sell this player or that player. I've been watching madrid for 30 years. Its been success after success. But, the game has changed and this team has to change with it. \n\nMarca or As was quick to write a story about how Xabi will have complete authority to play or bench whomever. That's complete BS, and everyone knows it. \n\nLuis Enrique was right. (paraphrasing) \"Attacking, you're the best, but when you're not attackeing, you're the best defender in the world, thats what a leader does.\" If Xabi can't put them in line I sure hope Dani and Fede do.

First season at the club, and he absolutely lit up the Bernab\u00e9u with those three goals against Galatasaray in the Champions League. 6-0 win, pure magic. You could just see the talent and confidence oozing out of him - and the connection with the fans was instant.\n\nHard to believe we might be talking about him leaving now. He\u2019s grown so much since that night. Still so much more to give. Really hope he stays. This club feels like his home.\n\nHala Madrid!",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\nIt really feels like we\u2019re finally building a complete squad: two quality players for almost every position, actual investment, and long-term planning.\n\nBut looking back\u2026 why didn\u2019t Ancelotti get this?\n\nI have nothing but respect for Carlo because the man delivered everything. And back then, every headline was, \u201cReal Madrid believe there are no players on the market with Real Madrid quality.\u201d\nWe were told over and over that there was no value, that Madrid wouldn\u2019t spend just to spend. Most of Carlo\u2019s reinforcements were free signings or very opportunistic deals.\n\nBut now under Alonso, we\u2019re actually spending. There\u2019s serious investment and a plan to finally have depth in every line.\n\nSo what changed?\n\t\u2022\tDid Ancelotti not push for signings?\n\t\u2022\tWas P\u00e9rez saving funds for the stadium and Mbapp\u00e9 saga?\n\t\u2022\tOr was Carlo just seen as a transitional figure, and this new \u201ccycle\u201d was always meant for the next manager?\n\nFeels a bit unfair in hindsight, considering what Ancelotti achieved with what he had. Curious to hear what you all think \u2014 is it timing, strategy, or just a change in mindset from the club?\n\nHala Madrid \u26aa\ud83d\udc51\n",

        "content": "As someone that has been supporting madrid for a long time, before the days of Ronaldo when Robinho, Drenthe, Diarra and them were in the team, and someone that has seen some truly awful madrid squads (not saying I know every single thing about madrid), one thing I always found funny is when my friends most who support teams based in England, call me a glory hunter when ironically enough I started supporting madrid during the worst periods.\n\nIts funny though because Raul was my idol even though stature wise I was closer to Drogba at 6,3 220+ pounds but I never played like that. The whole point of this is to say that from what I've seen in this sub with the way people overact to every defeat and turn on players when they are going through a rough patch, regardless of how high of an expectation we have as a club, it clearly shows that there are plenty in this sub that would literally stop supporting the club if we ever somehow become really shit.\n\nAnd as much we might not think its possible, truth is shit happens in football and times change and we could get a president after Perez that mismanages the club and then what. If half the sub loses their mind because we don't even win a preseason tournament after getting a new manager, new players and playing a new system and start losing their minds after 5 games, how will they ever handle coming 12th.",
