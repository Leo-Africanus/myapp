        "title": "Xabi Alonso won\u2019t fix Real Madrid overnight \u2014 unless the squad fits his vision",
        "content": "I\u2019ve closely followed Xabi Alonso\u2019s entire journey at Bayer Leverkusen \u2014 every detail \u2014 and that\u2019s why I\u2019m convinced he\u2019s the right coach. He\u2019s a dreamer of the game. What sets him apart is his willingness to learn from experiences in order to correct his mistakes. Xabi is not a rigid, formulaic coach \u2014 and rigidity never works in the long run. Instead, he\u2019s someone who seeks balance, and that\u2019s one of the most crucial elements in football.\n\nFootball is not just about names \u2014 not even the biggest or the best ones. It\u2019s a reflection of the social and environmental makeup of each player, each country, each league, and so on. That\u2019s why, for example, players who rely primarily on physicality are rare in La Liga \u2014 it\u2019s simply not in the league\u2019s player DNA.\n\nNo coach can succeed by using a tactical setup that doesn\u2019t suit the players\u2019 profiles. It\u2019s like asking a plumber to do electrical work \u2014 it\u2019s just not their job. That\u2019s why people expecting Xabi Alonso to instantly bring positional play, tiki-taka, or complex patterns to Madrid are being unrealistic. That kind of transformation doesn\u2019t happen overnight \u2014 and it certainly doesn\u2019t happen if the squad\u2019s characteristics don\u2019t fit.\n\nThere\u2019s also this idea that, just because Madrid has \u201cbetter\u201d players than Leverkusen, Xabi will automatically produce better results. That\u2019s a flawed mindset. Coaches can only work with what fits. Xabi\u2019s responsibility is to build a system with the right players \u2014 not just the best names. Blaming him for not succeeding with an incompatible squad is unfair.\n\nTake this example: If you tell someone that a player from Getafe is a better fit for Madrid than someone from Liverpool, they\u2019ll accuse you of being a \u201cfake intellectual.\u201d These people think football is just about big names and player rankings. But at Leverkusen, Xabi built a team around players who fit, and that\u2019s why the product on the pitch was so good.\n\nAt his press conference, Xabi said the team needs to control possession and slow the tempo \u2014 which has been a major issue for Madrid since Kroos. The team became overly vertical, and as a result, started losing possession far more frequently. Why? Because there\u2019s no true midfield organizer who can manage tempo and dictate play.\n\nThat\u2019s why a midfield made up of Valverde, Bellingham, Tchouam\u00e9ni, and Camavinga has failed repeatedly \u2014 they\u2019re all direct players. This leads to higher turnover, especially when there\u2019s no one playing between the lines effectively. That\u2019s also why the team looks better with Ceballos or Modri\u0107 on the pitch.\n\nEven the claim that Liverpool under Klopp had a similar midfield is a poor comparison. No one talks about the technical quality and on-ball organization of their backline. And even Klopp eventually brought in players like Thiago and Gravenberch to fix that. Likewise, Madrid won\u2019t improve until it has players with the right profiles.\n\nWith Milit\u00e3o, Arda G\u00fcler, Hausern, and someone like Carreras in the side, Madrid will naturally improve in possession. Then you can start building a proper midfield. That\u2019s where someone like Zubimendi \u2014 or any true midfield organizer \u2014 becomes essential. Only then will Madrid start solving its biggest problems.\n\nYes, the attack has issues too, but those will ease over time. The main thing is that Xabi Alonso learns. He observes, he studies his opponents, and that\u2019s why he\u2019ll eventually build a coherent system. There will be progress. There will be improvements. But the team won\u2019t reach the level people dream of unless the squad profile fits the system.\n\nPeople get excited watching training clips, but reality hits hard \u2014 just like it did in the match vs Al-Hilal. And then you had fans defending Ancelotti who were attacked for saying this very thing. The squad wasn\u2019t balanced. It wasn\u2019t built properly.\n\nFor instance, why did Hausern look so good vs Al-Hilal?\nBecause he has the quality and the right profile for what was asked of him.\n\nNow imagine signing a random defender with poor positional awareness, who can\u2019t contribute to buildup, can\u2019t show for passes, doesn\u2019t move intelligently, lacks spatial awareness \u2014 and then expecting the coach to teach him fundamentals he never learned growing up? And if that doesn\u2019t work, we blame the coach?\nThat\u2019s just unfair.",

No, they are destroyed physically. and mentally. They need rest and a preseason.\n\nIt is not by chance that our best players yesterday were Huijsen, Gonzalo and Guler. The ones who come from other teams or that barely player.\n\nI am not sure if it was Pintus, some failure in the preparation, the accumulation of fatigue due to lack of rotation or mental exhaustion due to the bad season but our players are literally destroyed.\n\nStop judging Bellimgham, Vini, Rodrygo, Valverde, Tchoanami (even if I am not a big fan of him) and even Fran Garcia.\n\nThey are not playing in their real level and they will not play that level during this CWC. It is simply not possible. But the next season they will be recovered. With fresh mind and body. Do you think a fresh Valverde would fail such penalty?\n\nAnd most of all stop blaming Xabi, who has trained them literally 4 days. Friday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. Do you believe he can do miracles? Do you have the minimum knowledge of how much time takes to learn new patterns? Have you ever played football or any other team sport?\n\nAlso respect Al Hilal, they are the best team in Asia, full of european players, adapted to heat, and they expended 400 million last 2 years. They would be in the 10 first teams of LaLiga without problems.\n\nOf course there are some issues, I still think we MUST sign Stiller or someone with that profile. We also need a Left Back because Fran Garcia positioning is nasty (although he provoked a penalty).\n\nBut we have a great team and a excellent trainer that is additionally a legend of the club in his own.\n\nPD: It is obvious our chances of winning the tournament are really slim. We should stop charging with minutes the stars and give time to all the rest.\n\nPut as a starters Gonzalo (again), Guler, Brahim, Chema (a 5 from the academy), victor munoz, diego aguadao (as left back)... and only play 1 or 2 real starters per game. And send bellimgham to the operation NOW.\n\nPD2: Focus on the good things also. Huijsen is majestic as a CB. I do not lie if I say that never in my life I saw so much potential in a CB",

It really upsets me how many madridistas are upset over the result when this is Xabi\u2019s first match along with the squad playing to his style. Also with it being Trents game the other players too we have to trust In them. Ontop of that the squad still needs to sign more players to cover important roles of the team. I may get downvoted but it\u2019s very important to be objective as football is like a roller coaster and there will always be highs and lows. I trust in Xabi and the squad that things will improve. Nonetheless , Hala Madrid. ",

        "content": "yes another post about Vinicius Jr.\nIn the first few minutes I was happy seeing Vini showing the intention to press and was looking forward to it. As the match progressed it became more clear he's \"pressing\" for the sake of it, there was literally no intention to get the ball ever, he just stood close to the player in possession. Also another thing annoyed me, whenever he lost the ball instead of tracking back he just stood there complaining. I've never liked this attitude, but he was making people like me ignore it with his performances from the last 6 months I don't remember any instance where Vini has performed well in 3 matches consistently, one match here and there is all I see. Hes getting too stuck up on numbers Goals Assists, he doesn't pass the ball unless there's a chance to assist and loses the ball and when there's even a small 1% chance to score he goes for the shot, if the shot doesn't go wide or over the goal it's a simple save for the goalkeeper. I want to back him in debates with my friends but all I can say is he was the best player itw 2 years ago and just a shell of his past right now.",

Altho he's had his moments yesterday yet again it's nothing like the Vini we've once known. \n\n\nWhat do you think needs to be changed? I speak of Vini coz he's a player that could literally be the deciding factor and it's sad to see him rather become a liability. Truly there's something wrong with him, not sure if he's in his head or what, something needs to be changed, he's literally our stardom player. \n\nThoughts?",

        "content": "I know there's basically nothing we can do about it but I just have to get this off my chest. Modric is still one of the best midfielders in the world at 39 years old. One of the common criticisms people make against him is that he doesn't have much stamina anymore but I think that's the opposite of the truth. When you look at the games where he started and played for the full 90 this season he didn't even really look that gassed and he's still always running up and down the field, of course he's had a few average performances but that doesn't change the fact that he has the most big chances created on the team. There are literally moments where he outpaces people that are like 10 years younger than him to make it back to the defense like today when he saved us twice\ud83d\ude2d, and players like guler could still learn a lot from him so I think it's really sad to see him go right now.",

For me there are a few that come to mind, but if I had to pick one out it would be his performance against **Bayern Munich in the 2023/2024 UCL Semi-Finals**. He was dribbling past every defender and creating great chances. Kimmich i think has nightmares to this day about Vini lol. The only reason he didnt have as much end production as he could have had, is because Manuel Neuer decided to have one of his best performances of the 2020s. ",

The players are clearly not at their best because it's a transition period - there is clear confusion amongst the players as the playstyle of Ancelotti and Xabi is drastically different, and even Man City suffered in the start under Pep Guardiola, and so did Allegri with Juventus. Good things take time and I believe Xabi's the man. Let's hope with Mbappe back we'll be stronger. ",

        "content": "I bought tickets to go to the game with my grandfather. He is a huge fan and had never seen the team play in person and he is 91. I drove to Orlando (3.5h one way) the day before to get him. Bought parking ($50) to be sure I didn\u2019t have to be looking last minute and waste time. \n\nArrived 1.5 hour earlier cause I knew there would be traffic no matter what - and there was. There was no way to ask for information and I would be moving a car length every 3 -4 minutes. I kept looking at the  parking lots for mine and I kept passing by lot 18-17-16-15 and suddenly there was no 14. Still at the same moving rate. I saw someone directing traffic and told me to turn around and it would be on my left. And well when I did the lot was closed as all of the same colored ones were. After moving that slow I found someone else and told me to go to lot 6 which took at least 20 minutes to get there from where I was. The game had already started at that point. My grandfather wasn\u2019t feeling too well either. After I got to lot 6.. it was closed. Parking was full everywhere. I asked the next person I saw and told me to do a U turn and it would be on my right (BS I just came from there and everything was closed) I then decided to find parking on my own in another plaza which were all full and you could see tow trucks left and right. After an extra 10 minute I found parking (free btw). \n\nThe it was a 20 minute walk to the stadium gate under 92 f sun. Finally arrived to the gate the game was in around minute 67. Finally walking in I was told I couldn\u2019t walk in with my small bag (that I had brought and was let in without problems for the Inter Miami - Al Ahly game on Saturday) so they made me lay 18 to put it in a locker room for basically the 20min left of the game. My grandfather wasn\u2019t feeling well and almost fainted, I had to hold him. The heat, the stress, no being able to have water for so long. Someone came to help but he said he doesn\u2019t need help, he\u2019ll brave through it to watch as much time as he could. Until we got to the seats. It was about minute 74. Got there to watch Valverde miss a penalty and at least we watched Modric go in (his favorite player) and hear the stadium chant his name. \n\nBesides that, nightmare and piss job from hard rock stadium. Made me miss the whole game, my grandpa faint and made me pay extra for shit because they felt like it. Oh it also took us 2 hours to get out of the parking because Miami drivers and traffic officers and organizers are ass. That was my experience today. $485 gone to waste with extra unpleasantness. FUCK Hard Rock Stadium. ",
