I have read that tickets for games that are not el clasico, Madrid derby etc you can usually get at the stadium the day of. Is that a true statement still? I have seen tickets for sale on sites like StubHub or viagogo, are those sold by season ticket holders? Because I know the tickets don\u2019t usually go on sale until the week of, unless you get the hospitality tickets. I see tickets for around $300 to sit in the middle of the stadium which is what I would be interested in, but is that a fair price to pay? Or should I rather wait until I\u2019m there?\n\nIf anyone has went to a game last season, any input would be appreciated. ",

        "content": "Bar\u00e7a won three titles this season so far, which are the La liga and spanish Super cup and Copa del rey against the same opponent,  Real Madrid and we had our entire backline injured. We would have won la liga if we had lesser injuries or not bottled the league after January. In UCL they got easiest draw Benifica and Dortmund who were 10th in Bundesliga then and lost moment they faced a good team Inter and conceded 7 goals against them. They will not be getting the same easy draw next season and we will be much better in league and other competitions.\u00a0will bar\u00e7a win everything next season and it\u2019ll be the start of a decade of domination like Messi era or will it be a one season thing or worst case scenario (best case for us) another 2022-2023 season where bar\u00e7a strips two domestic titles from Real and that\u2019s it?",
