Regarding this statement, I couldn\u2019t agree more. Even though Mbappe has his flaws, he is showing up to play every game and is the reason we are where we are. Him and Courtois, no matter how bad of a game they have, will always have my respect. Regarding on what he said, we have been lacking grit and desire. We are also extremely inconsistent. Ever since the 4-0 loss to psg at the cwc, Madrid had found something that clicked at the beginning of the season. Everyone was pressing, we were winning games, playing good football, and until that altercation between Xabi and Vini, all came downhill. Xabi wasn\u2019t the problem and it\u2019s obvious, the players are. A \u201cteam of champions\u201d doesn\u2019t kick out a manger and does what they want. This team badly needs to rebuild not only physically but also mentally and gain a lot more maturity and the hunger to win again. ",

He cannot handle a low block. \n\nSince last year, i dont think there are more than 5 games he performed at a 9/10+ level. What is crazy is that he keeps getting pampered, they keep pushing to get gim minutes, they keep praising him, they keep giving him the power that he doesn't deserve. Vini fanboys called Liverpool a small team for punishing Mo Salah, who isna bigger legend to them than Vini is for us while I think players should be held accountable. \n\nThe club has set a dangerous precedent. They are afraid of their matkertable players running hwir contract so they allow allow to do what they want. \n\nI'd be offended if I waa mbappe or Tbo, Vini is not on the same level of these 2 for us.

        "content": "I have been a fan since 2002. I cant remember the last time I have missed a Real Madrid match in the past 20 years. \n\nWe have had alot of generations come and go, but I havent seen a roster that make me feel this indifferent about the players themselves before.\n\nIt is really not about not winning. I was there during the Pep era. We lost 6-2 and we lost 5-0 but that team had a heart. That team had a soul. \n\nThe current roster feels souless. There is no Charisma in the team, even unhinged Pepe and Ramos are way more likable than our current roster. The difference is that previous rosters they did not demand respect they earned it by being warriors.\n\nThere is no collective goal. There is no sacrifice. They are not willing to do the dirty work. We have players that will throw tantrums if they don't play 90 minutes. Vini should have been subbed out today but we saw what happened last time Xabi tried to do that. \n\nVini's personality and attitude is one of the main reasons. He has been clutch and has won us some silverware but he has tarnished any good will he has created. The precedent he set in El Classico where he made a public tantrum against Xabi was disgusting and I dont know why my fellow fans dont see how bad of a precedent he has set. Alvaro A. Says that Vini wears his heart on his sleeve but I call bullshit. We were winning the classico and Vini made it all about him, he is selfish. With the salary he wants and the minutes he wants, every game he needs to perform like that monaco game and we all know that is fact that he dissapears more than he performs\n\nEven if we manage to win the CL and La Liga somehow. I really dont feel good about the group of players.",

        "content": "Let\u2019s be real about those two wins before Benfica: We weren\u2019t \"back.\" We were lucky. Courtois saved our lives, and Monaco and Villarreal simply weren't clinical enough to punish us. We got away with wins, but the problems were still there:\n\n\u2022 The Defense: Our defenders cannot defend. Period.\n\n\u2022 Zero Creativity: No vision or creativity from the back, just \"log\" defenders passing sideways.\n\n\u2022 The 'Golden Boy' back to Stinker Pipeline.\n\nThe players celebrated way too quickly. They saw us sitting in 3rd in the UCL and thought they were safe, so they played like dogshit against Benfica. Now, here we are heading for back-to-back playoffs.\n\nTwo red cards, 4 goals conceded, and most embarrassing one is a 98th-minute header by a keeper.",

        "content": "I'm not one to hate on particular players, specially in the first season, but I just don't see what the plan is with Franco. He is too slow to play at RW and worse than any other CAM we have in the team. He fails the eye-test almost every single game and I just don't see him helping us retain possession any more than Rodrygo or Brahim could (Brahim is also not a fit to the team in my opinion). If it's defense, playing Valverde at RW would be even better, I just don't get it. And to top it off, Endrick is breaking out at that position (I know that in France, but I genuinely think he would be a lot better than Franco currently is).\n\nIf you're a fan of Franco, can you explain to me why?",

        "content": "I remember when I started watching football and fell in love with this club. In that 2010 a new coach came as well as some random players, don't know if you guys know them (Ozil, Khedira, Di Maria \ud83d\ude09). I have started to watch that new club for me, and slowly became its supporter, which hasn't changed till this day. Oh yeah, that coach was Mourinho. \n\nBut now, yesterday's game. After everything that those players did this season, they don't deserve my support. I am still fan of this club, but not of these players (not all of them ofc). Their behavior, will, motivation, respect is not for this club. They deserved the L yesterday, it's a good think that L helped the special one and his team. Good luck Jose in the playoffs. And for you madrid players, I don't care about championes league or la liga anymore. I just want to make everything right in the club, and those who sabotage that out. \n\nHALA MADRID",
