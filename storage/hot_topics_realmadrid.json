The pitch in the di St\u00e9fano is awful in the first place, and a few minutes of heavy rainfall didn't help \n\n46' - 2nd half underway\n\n\ud83d\udd04 64' - Borja Alonso comes on for Loren Aguado, David moves to right back and the team will switch to 5-2-3\n\n72' - great individual play by Yusi who gets past two opponents with Croquetas, he slots it perfectly into the bottom corner with his weak foot from the edge of the box, but the keeper pulls out a great save to deny him\n\n77' - V\u00edctor is through and tries to round the keeper, but he gets a hand to it to prevent it - Sevilla's keeper is slowly turning into the MOTM here \n\n\ud83d\udd04 87' - some late subs by Ra\u00fal, Antonio David and Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez on for Chema and V\u00edctor \n\n\ud83d\udd04 90' - and another sub, Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga for David Jim\u00e9nez \n\n90'+4 - Sevilla with the best chance of the game in the last action, a free kick delivery gets longer and longer and ends up hitting the bar \n\nFT - 0:0 in an uneventful match where Castilla were the slightly better team and had most of the opportunities in the game.

        "content": "R\u00fcdiger hit with the flu, doubtful for the match against Rayo.\n\nProblems for Ancelotti in defense, as the German will likely be out against Rayo Vallecano. Alaba and Asencio are expected to be in the starting lineup this Sunday. Problems for Real Madrid in defense ahead of their match against Rayo Vallecano this Sunday at 16:15, on Matchday 27 of La Liga. Antonio R\u00fcdiger did not train with the team on Saturday due to a flu-like illness and is a serious doubt for the game at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u. The German, who has played a heavy load of matches and is dealing with discomfort in one of his knees, did not train with the rest of his teammates and is almost certain to miss the match against Rayo, although Madrid has not completely ruled him out.\n\nAncelotti will likely field Alaba and Asencio in central defense against Rayo, with Fran Garc\u00eda at left-back. On the right, Lucas V\u00e1zquez is the favorite to start, although Valverde trained without issues and could play. However, he may be rested with the Champions League Round of 16 second leg against Atl\u00e9tico in mind, which Madrid will play on Wednesday at the Metropolitano, following their 2-1 victory in the first leg.\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://as.com/futbol/primera/rudiger-con-gripe-duda-para-el-encuentro-contra-el-rayo-n/",
