The team deserves to take the lead and needs to continue like this in the second half \n\n46' - 2nd half underway \n\n\ud83d\udd04 62' - first sub, Y\u00e1\u00f1ez on for Cristian David\n\n68' - great save by Pi\u00f1eiro who scratches the ball of the line on a header after a corner \n\n\ud83d\udd04 70' - David Ruiz for de Llanos\n\n75' - massive double chance for Castilla, after Y\u00e1\u00f1ez' shot is blocked, the ball falls for David outside of the box, but the keeper can save his shot - the ball falls to Y\u00e1\u00f1ez who plays it back to David, his cross is spectacular and Gonzalo's header towards the bottom left corner is too, but the keeper's save is even better \n\n\u26bd 84' - it's just ridiculous at this point - Castilla in full control, David Ruiz loses the ball in his own half - Elejalde's shot is deflected heavily by Edgar, and the ball goes past Pi\u00f1eiro into the net who was heading into the other corner... \n\n\ud83d\udd04 85' - last sub, Loren Zu\u00f1iga in for Yusi \n\n90'+1 - Fan culture is so shit in Spain man, Antequera away fans are non stop provoking instead of cheering on their team \n\n90'+3 - great save by Pi\u00f1eiro to deny the 1-3 \n\nFT - I'm so sick of this team at this point, another match where a win was a must both with the chances they had and the situation on the table - the team has to realise that only wins and points count at this point, or they will absolutely and inevitably get relegated \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 12:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee**: \u00c1lvaro C\u00e1novas Garc\u00eda-Villarrubia \n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 2, Matchday 13\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[FEF TV](https://feftv.com) (subscription - 12.99\u20ac/month)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (5-2-3): Diego Pi\u00f1eiro - Youssef Enr\u00edquez \u2018Yusi\u2019 (85' Loren Zu\u00f1iga), Edgar Pujol, Mario Rivas, Loren Aguado, David Jim\u00e9nez - Jos\u00e9 Maria Andr\u00e9s \u2018Chema\u2019, Cristian David (62' Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez) - Gonzalo Garc\u00eda, Hugo de Llanos (70' David Ruiz), V\u00edctor Mu\u00f1oz \n\nBench: Mario de Luis (GK), Quique Ribes, Antonio David.\n\nUnavailable: Fran Gonz\u00e1lez (Spain U21 call-up), David Cuenca (pubalgia) Pablo Ram\u00f3n (ACL tear), Ra\u00fal Asencio (?), Jacobo Ram\u00f3n (muscle injury), Manuel \u00c1ngel (muscle injury), Andr\u00e9s Campos (muscular injury), C\u00e9sar Palacios (ACL tear), Borja Alonso (muscle injury), Pol Fortuny (muscle injury). \n\nCoach: Ra\u00fal\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** DLDDW\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 16th | 12pt | 2-6-4 | 14:12\n",

I live in Berlin and can\u2019t return it in person.\n\nI still have the receipt, but the official customer support hasn\u2019t been very helpful so far.

        "content": "Hear me out first , our fanbase is one of the agressive ones where we demand results nonmatter what. If a manager or players doesn't live up to the expectations then he would be criticised by fans. Mbappe is exactly that because the hype around him is enormous and it's been there for us since 2021 when there were initial rumours. Now mbappe's problem is the adaptability here because PSG worked around him but RMA won't (we still aren't benching him tho). Mbappe needs to find his essence here.\n\nNow why I believe in mbappe is because I used to see fucking PSG's match due to this guy. It was so fun to watch him although there were so many problems in that team and then came 2020 UCL run and eventually worldcup. He has shown his potential and certainly a big game player. \n\nMbappe right now is something that he tries hard to do something , make something out of the chances (hits the goalkeeper lol) , he is trying to be on the ball but I feel he isn't using his real strength of getting behind , la liga's and Ligue un difference is huge. Fellow players and Ancelotti will play a major role and especially Ancelotti because he have to teach him rather than following mbappe that he'll do something. I feel so frustrated while watching the matches because I used to think that our midlfielf + mbappe would be something out of this world yet here we are struggling without kroos \ud83d\ude2d\n\nAlso the problem isn't mbappe solely , our structure is the problem because there isn't one most of the times and we need to improve. It took longer than this to players to adapt and once our team starts clicking , we will be unbeatable \ud83d\ude0c",

        "content": "Two days ago, ESPN's Graham Hunter released an article about Real Madrid's injury issues. In there, he notes that Paul Burgess walked away from Madrid because of concerns over the focus on the pitch. This was the first I heard of it and thought I just missed it. But then when I tried to search for more details on it, I could not find anything else online about it. This seems like a MASSIVE story to just be passed by.   \n  \nHere is what Graham Hunter said, \"Right in the middle of renovating their modern and impressive football edifice, Madrid were warned by then-head of pitch maintenance, Paul Burgess, that they had lost focus on how important that part of the project was. He walked away from the club, convinced that it was sewing the seeds of future problems in how they move and store the pitch underground.\"\n\nAnyone else believe this an extremely underplayed story?",
