Nothing! He got away free, since then the team started to lose discipline. We also see Mastantuono can bring balance, Xabi knew it and was keep using him, but he also got little time after injury.\n\nAnd remember the ATM 2-5 loss, or even the PSG loss? It all got to do with insert a star player who had just recovered into the formation and caused disaster.\n\nXabi's problem was not being too tough, but too nice when you can't step back. If you do you will be pushed to the abyss in a matter of time. This has happened many times before in RM and other teams. I still feel bad for him and  think sacking him was not the right time. And I want to correct the misinfo of \"RM never need such coach\". Both Jose and Capello are very important in our recent great era.",

        "content": "I know we won 6-1, it was amazing to watch us dominate an opponent this way after back to back lows and Vini played well. But I wouldn't give in to thought that we are so back and Vini will be great again because we played against a team which was playing higher and we could counter well. \n\nI haven't forgotten the matches against teams that play a low block and Vini instead of passing the ball back attempts a 1v3 dribble loses the ball and complains instead of tracking back, and we get fucked on the counter. The second thing I want to point out, we have seen the flashes of good all the time in the past 1 year but they came very sporadically and he wasn't consistent at all, even wingers like Sterling and Walcott could produce flashes of Brilliance once in 5-7 games, the reason they are not considered the best is because they weren't consistent. Then comes the time when the coach subs him off he does nothing but complain and  finally says, I'll leave the club, that's a cardinal sin in my eyes because the club has always discarded players who have done this.And if you're playing shit we have amazing players like Brahim and Gonzalo that can come in and change the game. And to the Vini fans this wasn't just a Xabi thing he did this with Ancelotti as well but Ancelotti being Ancelotti played it down.\n\nAll we need is for him to be consistent, complain less and if you're playing shit, be quiet when you're substituted or benched the next game. Pass the ball when you are outnumbered and when the opposition team is playing a low block, because you clearly don't know how to break it down.And finally don't ask Cristiano Ronaldo money if you can't put up Cristiano Ronaldo numbers.\n\nAbove All Hala Madrid, the club has seen many Vinis and many better than Vini, and they'll continue to do so because this is the biggest Football club in the history of football.",

        "title": "Two different tactics we should be using when playing against deep defending and high line oppositions",
        "content": "It\u2019s my take on how we can utilise strength and cover weakness of our players while playing against 2 different type of opposition.\n\n1. Deep lying defences: biggest problem we face when we face teams that sit back and defend is lack of presence in box, Gonzalo can add that presence in box. Guler will be key to unlock the defence as he is our best creater. Mbappe can play in free role. We can sacrifice one spot in midfield. As we might not need to defend as much.\n\n2. High line defences: This is where Real Madrid found most success. We won\u2019t need Gonzalo, instead we can add one more body in midfield Camavinga. Valverde can play right wing when one of Carvajal or Trent are available. This will allow solid base of defence to work on pacy attack of Mbappe, Vini and Bellingham.\n\nFew things I considered:\n\n1. Mbappe, Vini &amp; Bellingham are undisputed starters. Not my preference but it is as it is as per RM board.\n\n2. Considering injuries, we will have to play whoever is  available. Hope this changes in future.",
