When recording your responses keep in mind that a\u00a0**1**\u00a0should be reserved for awful, career-worst games, while a\u00a0**10**\u00a0should reflect an exceptional, near-perfect match.

        "content": "Lunin endured the pain of his injury from the 50th minute until full time against Sociedad before, and it was only discovered after the game that he had a muscle injury. Still able to play but with painkillers, most likely not able to bring out his best performance and worsen the injury.\n\nCourtois our main goalkeeper will only be ready against arsenal.\n\nFran Gonz\u00e1lez, our third goalkeeper who has never played at our senior club.\n\n~~Cama &amp; Fede are ready to be the goalkeepers.~~ (lol jk)\n\nNow Madrid are in the title race in the laliga standings.\n\nWho do you think is the best option for the goalkeeper who should play in tomorrow match against Valencia?",
