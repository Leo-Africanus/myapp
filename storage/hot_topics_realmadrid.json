Inspiring.\n\n---\n\nNow here\u2019s the part that really hurts:  \n**Four of those six losses \u2014 Valencia, Betis, Espanyol, Athletic \u2014 were by a single goal.**  \nAs in: *completely winnable*.\n\nFlip those, and that\u2019s **12 extra points**.  \nWe\u2019d be **five points clear** of Bar\u00e7a\u2019s 85 \u2014 and that\u2019s *without even touching the Clasicos*.\n\nLet\u2019s relive the heartbreak, shall we?\n\n---\n\n### **Valencia**  \n\u2022 3.5 xG, 21 shots, 9 on target. We scored *one*.  \n\u2022 They had 0.7 xG, 2 shots on target \u2014 scored *two*.  \n&gt; Played them off the pitch. Lost anyway. Magic.\n\n---\n\n### **Betis**  \n\u2022 Lost 2\u20131.  \n\u2022 Gave them 18 shots worth 2.39 xG. They needed just 3 on target to score twice.  \n\u2022 We managed 2 on target the entire game. 9 shots total. 1.13 xG.  \n&gt; Clinical... just not from us.\n\n---\n\n### **Espanyol**  \n\u2022 21 shots. 7 on target. 0 goals. xG: 1.3.  \n\u2022 They had 5 shots total, 2 on target, worth just 0.3 xG \u2014 and scored one.  \n&gt; At this point, the universe was just trolling us.\n\n---\n\n### **Athletic**  \n\u2022 Both teams took around 10 shots. 1.8 xG each.  \n\u2022 We got 5 on target and scored once.  \n\u2022 They got 3 on target and scored two.  \n&gt; Guess who took their chances?\n\n---\n\nEven if we still let Betis beat us (the toughest of the four and our sloppiest showing), just **winning the other three** \u2014 which we *should* have \u2014  \nwe\u2019d be **two points clear** of Bar\u00e7a.\n\n---\n\n### **Aggregate across Valencia, Espanyol &amp; Athletic:**  \n\u2022 **Shots:** Us: 52 | Them: 17  \n\u2022 **On Target:** Us: 21 | Them: 7  \n\u2022 **xG:** Us: 6.6 | Them: 2.8  \n\u2022 **Goals:** Us: 2 | Them: 5  \n\n---\n\n**Conversion Rates:**  \n\u2022 1 goal every **26 shots** for us  \n\u2022 1 goal every **3.4 shots** for them  \n\u2022 1 goal every **10.5 shots on target** for us  \n\u2022 1 goal every **1.4 shots on target** for them  \n\nWe **underperformed by 4.6 goals**.  \nThey **overperformed by 2.2**.\n\n---\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a missed title.  \nIt\u2019s a **manual on how to bottle one**.\n\n---\n\nSo who do we blame?  \nNot Bar\u00e7a.  \nNot the refs.  \nNot bad luck.\n\n**Us. Only us.**\n\nWe didn\u2019t drop the ball.  \n**We slammed it into the dirt and left a crater.**\n\nAnd when you do that, you don\u2019t get to whine when someone else picks it up and runs with it.\n\n**They earned their celebration.**  \n**We earned the reruns.**\n\n---\n\n**We underperformed.**  \nThat\u2019s on us.\n\nEverything else?  \nJust background noise.",

( it started when Barca fans waved a beach ball at Vini during the previous el clasico because of the snub)\n\nHave our players trolled them like this on social media since 2020? I just cant recollect any but I don't remember us doing Instagram Live  or anything, but maybe I'm missing something. If we've been just as bad, I get why they're clapping back. If not, why are they so extra? \n\nLike pique mocking us was better  that idiot was so obsessed with madrid that no one cared about him but when someone like fermin starts throwing shade idk it's just too insulting.",

        "content": "I never used to believe in PR in football. I thought performances on the pitch spoke for themselves. But recently? The spin is hard to ignore \u2014 especially when it comes to Bar\u00e7a.\n\nJust look at this:\nI saw a post comparing Yamal\u2019s La Liga titles to Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s. No mention of Champions League football. As if La Liga is the ultimate metric now? When did we stop counting UCLs \u2014 where Ronaldo and Madrid actually built their legacy?\n\nEven worse, I\u2019ve seen takes like \u201cMessi destroyed the Ronaldo-Benzema era.\u201d\nReally? That same era where Zidane\u2019s Madrid beat MSN, won 3 UCLs in a row, and consistently showed up in big games? Somehow MSN is still glorified as the peak, and now people are acting like Yamal will \u201cdestroy\u201d this current Madrid era \u2014 based on one season?\n\nAnd the double standards don\u2019t stop there.\n\nLast year, when Bar\u00e7a were manager-hopping, it was called a \u201crebuilding phase.\u201d\n\nThis year, when we\u2019re dealing with a massive injury crisis and still competing on all fronts? Silence. No talk of transition, no credit for fighting through it.\n\n\nLook \u2014 I respect La Masia. They develop real talent.\nBut these kinds of narratives feel rushed and selective. If we win, it\u2019s \u201cexperience\u201d or \u201cluck.\u201d If they win once, it\u2019s \u201ca new golden era.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s not rewrite football history just to fit an agenda.\nMadrid\u2019s dominance is recent. It\u2019s real. And it\u2019s earned.",

Carreras has a nice balance between attacking and defending. However, Tchouameni would need to hold a more defensive role, freeing Jude to make those late runs into the box like he did last season.\n\nWith Carreras, Fede, and Trent joining the attack, we\u2019d still always have at least four players behind the ball and pressing high.\n\nOf course, it would all come down to everyone buying in and sticking to their roles.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",
