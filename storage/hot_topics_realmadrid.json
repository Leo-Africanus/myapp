He is 26 years old and commands the Dortmund defense. The price he is going for is below of what he should be going for. Especially when we got Huijsen for 60 million, and he is the least defensively capable CB we have. Schlotterbeck is the best option for his price tag and will bring the physicality we lack. I hope we don\u2019t miss out on him, since we are known for missing great deals. ",

        "content": "My best friend is a diehard Liverpool fan and I\u2019m a Real Madrid fan. \n\nObviously neither clubs are having their best seasons this year. Earlier in the year we were talking about reasons why our clubs were struggling. I discussed how we have never truly replaced Toni Kroos and desperately need a controller / regista player. \n\nI proposed the idea to him to trade Camavinga for MacAllister. Both were underperforming at the time. There is not very many world class controllers out there in the world. And I knew he had always been a Cama enjoyer and he agreed to the hypothetical trade. Now both players have began to regain form since 2026 and the clubs tho still not perfect are also finding a little bit of form as well. \n\nWhat do you guys think would you trade Camavinga for MacAllister?",

        "content": "Guys we really need to stop talking about signing new attackers and start being realistic.\n\nWe have Gonzalo Garcia as a Mbappe backup and Endrick is coming back, who can also play RW if needed. On the left Vini Jr is basically undroppable. If he\u2019s out Mbappe can play there and in an emergency even Brahim, even though he\u2019s more of a right sided player.\n\nOn the right we have Mastantuono who can also rotate into CAM with Arda depending on the situation. Arda can play RW but he has clearly shown he\u2019s much better as a CAM. Like I said Brahim can play on the right too. Rodrygo as well and in my opinion he should start when he\u2019s fit. He can also cover the left. Even Valverde can be put on the wing sometimes.\n\nWe are not lacking depth or quality in attack at all. That\u2019s not our main issue.\n\nWhat we should really think about is a proper central midfielder. Someone who can control the tempo and distribute the ball. Tchouameni and Camavinga are more ball winners than actual playmakers. And honestly we might soon need a RB and CB replacement too because I don\u2019t know how long Carvajal and Alaba can keep performing at a reliable level.\n\nWe don\u2019t need another superstar. We need solid players for defensive and central positions who are fine with being on the bench sometimes and who help the team function. Players who know their role and don\u2019t care about headlines.\n\nAnd please let\u2019s stop the Mbappe or Vini has to leave discussions. Both should stay. The attack is not our biggest problem. We just need better chemistry and better coordinated runs up front/better positioning in general.\n\nThe real issues are further back in the squad in my opinion. The starting eleven doesn\u2019t need a huge overhaul, just smart reinforcements in the right positions.",

        "content": "I don\u2019t know man\u2026 it really feels like it.\n\nVini just looks\u2026 different again. When he gets the ball now, you actually lean forward a bit. Like okay, something\u2019s about to happen.\n\nHe\u2019s not forcing it. Just playing. Taking his man on, making the right pass when it\u2019s there, finishing without overcomplicating it.\n\nThat confidence is back. You can see it in the way he runs at defenders. They look worried again.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m getting carried away\u2026 but this really feels like peak Vini again. Anyone else feel it or just me?",
