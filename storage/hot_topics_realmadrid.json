        "content": "I've seen a clip of Bellingham being visibly in pain after getting subbed off against Salzburg, and it was due to his dislocated shoulder injury way back in 2023 against Rayo. I didn't think Jude still has a problem with it because he never grabbed his shoulder or his back during the game.\n\nThe fact that he went through all of 2024 playing in pain and still being able to deliver match after match makes my mouth drop. He couldn't undergo the shoulder surgery last summer obviously because of Euro campaign, and if he did England wouldn't even qualify for knockouts, let alone the final where the only reason England got to it in the first place is because of Jude risking a relapse scoring an acrobatic bicycle kick against Slovakia which not one player would even THINK of doing, let alone with shoulder pain.. insane mentality\n\nIn my opinion, his pain will not go away until he gets his surgery done, and it'll take 2 months to recover from it. He should get it ASAP after the season ends during the summer. He's already playing at a world class level, but he could reach the next level next season without the shoulder pain holding him back.",

It keeps Dortmund from going into the top 8 in the rankings.\n\n**GNK Dinamo Zagreb vs. AC Milan**\n\nAnother draw here would work in Madrid\u2019s favor. A win for Milan could result in Milan pulling ahead of us.\n\n**Lille vs. Feyenoord**\n\nOnce again, a draw is what we\u2019re rooting for. If one of these teams grabs all three points, it could complicate Madrid\u2019s qualification hopes.\n\n**What Madrid Needs to Do:**\n\nWe need to win by at least 3 goals in order to get to the top 8 by goal difference.\n\nIt\u2019s all on the line this week, so let\u2019s hope the results fall our way.
