It'll be strictly objective analysis. How many of you guys would like to see something like this? If you would, please let me know what you'd like to see and express your interest in general. \n\nI'm asking because it'll take me around 2/3 hours of editing, but it'll be good for the sub (at least I think so). \n\nI can start out with Benfica Vs Real. \n\nLet me know folks. \n\nHala Madrid!",

        "content": "There is so many thing wrong in this video. Dean lying down on the ground knowing that rayo are going to counter attack. Mbappe throwing hand in the air knowing that he can track him. To be honest It is bound to happen because you can't simply change the habit of the player. I love mbappe a lot but thing like this make me question a lot of thing. From past la liga games he is looking so stiff. He loses the ball more often and refuse to cover the space. Even against benfica arda had to move up to cover the diagonal space of benfica cb and cm. If mbappe did not bother to do that then we could've extra man in midfield which is something we needed against benfica. There is a reason why team make a lot of channel run against the team for which mbappe plays. Edin Terzi\u0107 ( Dortmund coach who took them to ucl final 2024 ) also explained that mbappe lack of defending attitude boost their plays A LOT. You will always see our opponent make channel run with their 10 or 8. I know at the end of season this thing will be ignored because ofcourse someone else will get blamed but its not coincidence that our chemistry is 50% worse than what it used to be in 2024 ucl winning season. What do you all think about this? Pls give me your opinion as well.\n\n  \n",

        "content": "I really don\u2019t understand the hate on Mbapp\u00e9 everywhere and moreover in this sub. People tend to compare him to Ronaldo where there is no point to do it with the goat.\n\nRemember also that CR7 had actually legends surrounding him while playing in RMA and I don\u2019t think you can compare the current roster to the likes of Bale, Benzema, Toni Kroos, Luca Modric, prime Isco, Sergio Ramos, Pepe, Angel di Maria\u2026.\n\nI read a lot about his lack of defense, which I can agree, but isn\u2019t he a striker? Do we expect striker who\u2019s averaging more than 1 goal per game to handle defense? It really reminds me of Juventus fans telling it\u2019s CR7 fault while the team was so much worse than what he used to have even if he was top scorer of Serie A.\n\nAlso bear in mind that they are all playing every 3 days and if he were to attack and defend every time, trust me you\u2019ll not see him healthy a lot. You can see how many times Jude was injured and still is while he\u2019s physically more than gifted. Football is not NBA, and you cannot put on a bench a player to rest and expect him to come back later in the game.\n\nJust a rant because I\u2019m kind of sad and annoyed to see all those negative comments with people who know football through instagram reels or are playing too much FIFA.

As a matter of fact, a few weeks before he got sacked Jude said that he would play anywhere the coach wants him to play even though he likes scoring goals. You're telling me all it takes is a few sources to say that he was against xabi and now the whole fanbase turns on him and whistles him while he's injured? Because as far as I know I never saw any tier 1 sources say he was against xabi so all this hate I've been seeing since last month is mind boggling. ",

        "content": "Now I'm not GG glazer. He ios far from the finished product, two things are obvious tho. He provides a unique profile to the front line that no one else can. And he is NOT a winger lol. \n\nWith Vini suspended I think this gives Arbeola a unique opportunity to experiment with the squad lineup and tactics. \n\nI would like to see something like this:  \nST. GG  \nLW. Mbappe  \nRW. Rodrygo (Franco has been buns sadly)  \nAM. Guler   \nLDM. Camavinga  \nRDM. Tchouameni  \nLB. Carreras  \nRB. Fede  \nLCB. Huijsen  \nRCB. Raul  \nK. Thibo\n\nKey Subs:  \n\\-Ceballos for Camavinga  \n\\-Brahim for Rodrygo or GG  \n\\-Franco for GG or Rodrygo\n\nTactical Changes:\n\nI would like to see more fluidity in our defensive rotations, which imo would really help the counter-press, transition defense, and build-up too. Camavinga has really excelled when inverting from the LB position. I would like to see Carreras do this more (not like Vini uses his overlaps and Carreras is too afraid to unerlap into the congested left half-space that Mbappe and Jude love to occupy as well)\n\nWith Carreras and Camavinga rotating and switching seemlessly it can create mismatches and confuse man-man marking or find gaps in positional pressing. I would like to see this more from Fede as well on the right, I want him to naturally flow into the midfield whenever Tchouameni gets stuck inbetween CBs or can't cover the ground fast enough. \n\nOne Alternative:\n\nFrankly, our other injuries do not really allow this to happen but I would not mind seeing a front two of GG and Mbappe up top with a diamond. This would mean we would be able to play Fede in the midfield, maybe even in a Jude type role off the left. But this is contingent on Carvajal being fit enough to play the majority of the match. ",

        "content": "I mean I get it Franco, Dean, Raul is playing very bad recently our defense is shit and all, but this is getting out of hand, people are hating them for no reason, it was similar to Vini's first few years at the club, we made him suffer, but he then rebounded with 3 great seasons and now I don't have nothing to say because of his current condition and ego. \n\nBut apart from that Vini had to go through a lot at the very young age, but at that time we had legends and more mature players to guide him. So what I am saying is yeah they are playing shit at the moment. It happens they came to a very imbalanced and ego centric team, our team is in a messed up condition, this is what happens when your team consists of less experienced players.\n\nAnyway I am guarantee you if we just kept faith in them for 1 more season, they will bounce back. I mean dean is just 20 years old, Raul is 22, Franco is 18 years old and they are playing in the biggest club in the world that pressure is immense, I bet no one in our community wouldn't dare to touch the ball with that kind of pressure. It takes time to adjust, what can they do.\n\nThey just witnessed a coach that promised them get sacked, I mean it is a big shoes to fill, I mean this is what happens when you sign players to the biggest club in the world with very little experience, jude and Mbappe are made in such a way that they could handle these pressure at the very young age. But not everyone is them.\n\nSo what I am saying is we can criticize them on match day's but stop promoting hate on them, it's very unnecessary.",
