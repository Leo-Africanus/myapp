        "content": "If I'm not wrong Takefusa Kubo has a buy back clause with us and with are current \"proper right winger\" situation, it got me thinking, imagine we kept him. He would work well with our current system and he is left footed. No disrespect to Brahim he is for sure a wonderful supersub, but everytime he starts he doesn't have his best game. I know we have Mastantuono but theoretically would we have even bought him if we had Kubo? ",
