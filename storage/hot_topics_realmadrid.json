We are clearly willing to let Rodrygo go, he has proven himself on the big stage and is also more marketable than these players.\n\nIf a one season player like Ekitike goes for 70-80+ from Frankfurt.

        "content": "Been noticing a lot of pointless dramas inside the community especially on twitter and Instagram and It is not what the team needs right now. \n\nOur players are active on social media, contrary to what people think. For example, this is like [the 3rd post ](https://x.com/kingbeofguler/status/1948120928120098839)I've seen in the past few hours alone with alot of likes trying to create a rift among Real Madrid fans. I seriously dont understand this No. 10 drama. Arda had only a couple of months of starter level minutes what has he done to deserve the no. 10? It took Yamal 2 years of consistent performances to get the no. 10. \n\nOn the other hand, despite a few rough months at the start. Mbappe played out of his mind and managed to get the Golden boot which is something that only  happened to 2 players in Real Madrid history before Mbappe, on his first season. Imagine if he adapted from the start, he would have had some record breaking numbers.\n\nThis Vini Vs. Mbappe drama is also not something the team needs right now, they need to be partners and not rivals. Mbappe has managed to adapt the central forward role and it is something that Xabi Alonso clearly wants to continue with. He wants out forwards to be more centrally and our wing backs and Midfielders to overload the wings. Mbappe just needs to work on his work rate cuz everything else he has been amazing at.\n\nThe point is that the community and the players need more unity otherwise we are lose. The players will have another bad season and the fans will be dissapointed. \n\nI'm sorry but these things are less important than getting silverware. I'm starting to think that people are more like Vini and Arda fanboys than Real Madrid fans. ",

        "content": "   So we do not want to risk signing someone like Stiller because he might not proved himself enough yet. We do not want to pay 120 million for Mac or Enzo because it is seen as too expensive. However, we are totally content with spending 100 million to sign Rodri who is almost 30 and is coming from a big injury. Not only does Rodri have beef with the club, but he is also a gamble just like stiller. We do not know if he will recover and be worth the price. Going for Rodri sounds more like a marketing strategy than actually going for a valuable player to me. Florentino seems to love Ballon D\u2019or winners, but I hope it doesn\u2019t go through. Rodri was an exceptional player but paying 100m for him now sounds like too big of a risk.",

        "content": "I want to clarify that I really like Arda and I see what he is capable of doing offensively,I also don't forget that he's a young player and he needs to gain experience, and the best way to gain experience is to play BUT \nFor me, Camavinga has been trained for a long time in the position where everyone imagines Arda playing next season. \nFor those who remember him at Rennes, he played like Xabi would like.\nHis problem is injuries but we all agreed that he has enormous qualities. \nHe is much better defensively than Arda and he has more experience so I think that in matches where he does not want to take risks he will prioritize Camavinga \n\nMessage to the Turkish soldier: I am not a Mobutu soldier (in France we call him that) and I am not trying to threaten your commander, the great Arda Guler.",

        "content": "I really hope Flo and the board allow Xabi to do what he needs to do with the team, so we can transition into the next era.\n\nWe were performing better and better in the CWC and Xabi is trying to implement tactical football to a team that was never micromanaged. These things take time but honestly PSG game aside, I think the outcome was very positive. \n\nThe fact that Xabi was willing to play the best players for each role over bigger names and he was willing to bench Vini against PSG speaks volumes. I honestly think that youngsters like Arda and franco mastantuono will be able to shine this season, they are the type of players that Xabi loves, players that can play direct and fast paced football.\n\n3 incidents happened. Xabi was forced to play Vini as his intention was to bench him, and he was forced to play Valverde as an RB. On top of that, 2 stupid mistakes from our CBs made the situation even worse. We would have seen a different game if it werent for these incidents. \n\nIf Rodrygo gets sold, I think we could see Vini have a lesser role in the team unless he is able to turn his form around and adapt to Xabi ball. I think Xabi is willing to play Mbappe and Garcia together upfront with players like Arda, Bello and Franco to support them.",
