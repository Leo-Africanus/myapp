I remember people in 2010-11 thinking Messi and Pep Barca will dominate European football for the next 10 years. Mourinho, despite his record breaking 2011-12, was absolutely thrashed by the press and fans due to Casillas incident. \n\nThe same thing over and over again. \"Mbappe is a big ego loser\", \"Vini is finished\". Xabi has a lot of work to do and the team needs a DEFENSIVE overahaul. I don't expect anything special this season, we have clearly entered a rebuilding phase after Kroos - Modric - Carlo departure. If we win a domestic trophy, it will be a success. \n",

But let\u2019s not forget that he\u2019s only played three games(was out sick, lost 5 kgs) two off the bench. The actual season hasn\u2019t even started yet. Players are still building fitness and chemistry, and Xabi Alonso is still figuring out the system.\n\nCriticism is okay, that\u2019s a part of football. But what I\u2019m seeing isn\u2019t just criticism, it\u2019s pure hate. We wanted Mbapp\u00e9 for years, he did okay this season, and now some fans are turning on him, let's not be too quick and let Xabi have his time with him. He's arguably the best in the world currently and Xabi will get him to play that way. \n\nLet's just step back and let Xabi do his thing. ",

Why didn\u2019t Leverkusen maintain that same momentum in the following season?

        "content": "This sub is filled with praises to Luis Enrique, as if he had invented football, trashing our players, and even Xabi Alonso. FFS, it's been one month with a new system, a completely new system, and we failed against the best team in Europe right now.\n\nPeople are whining about Mbapp\u00e9 and Vini, and say they don't work together, they are divas, ego this, ego that... after only a month. You don't know how it will work out, one month is not enough for a new coach to adjust his system, to convince his players, to fix issues. Again, ONE MONTH!\n\nPeople are loving Luis Enrique now, but you know how many seasons he's been in PSG? Two full seasons. Do you know when his team started functioning? In January. People tend to forget PSG barely made it out of the group phase. Now, it sounds like PSG has been working like that since the first day.\n\nThen, you have all the people saying Mbapp\u00e9 is the problem because he left and PSG won. Again, PSG did not start working until 6 months after Mbapp\u00e9 left. And it's not like poor PSG got stuck with second tier players after losing their star. No, they splashed more money, as they always do, to get exactly the top players they wanted, for another year.\n\nJust stop the nonsense.",

Look at it this way, we did better than Inter, and they had a better season than us.\n\nWe have some talented players. We got a talented coach. Give the man some time to cook before we all start losing our minds. Despite the tragic 4-0 loss, I am super excited and optimistic about next season.\n\nJust my 2 cents. Let me know your thoughts on the matter.",

        "content": "To me the biggest issue is that our midfield never has the ball against big teams. We always struggle to even get the ball in the first place so does getting a creative midfielder really fix that? But I guess that's why we're gonna be using the 3-5-2. But at the same time it's kinda crazy because all these other big teams could get the ball with only 3 midfielders so why can we never do the same?",
