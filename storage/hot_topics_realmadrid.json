        "content": "There is so many thing wrong in this video. Dean lying down on the ground knowing that rayo are going to counter attack. Mbappe throwing hand in the air knowing that he can track him. To be honest It is bound to happen because you can't simply change the habit of the player. I love mbappe a lot but thing like this make me question a lot of thing. From past la liga games he is looking so stiff. He loses the ball more often and refuse to cover the space. Even against benfica arda had to move up to cover the diagonal space of benfica cb and cm. If mbappe did not bother to do that then we could've extra man in midfield which is something we needed against benfica. There is a reason why team make a lot of channel run against the team for which mbappe plays. Edin Terzi\u0107 ( Dortmund coach who took them to ucl final 2024 ) also explained that mbappe lack of defending attitude boost their plays A LOT. You will always see our opponent make channel run with their 10 or 8. I know at the end of season this thing will be ignored because ofcourse someone else will get blamed but its not coincidence that our chemistry is 50% worse than what it used to be in 2024 ucl winning season. What do you all think about this? Pls give me your opinion as well.\n\n  \n",

I've seen the heartbreaks and the glory days during this 19 year period, but I must say that this team is the most disjointed in the history of our club. \n\nFor those who'll say that I'm from India and my opinion doesn't matter, I'll just tell you to piss off because you don't know the things that supporting this club got me while growing up. \n\nThis club and particularly San Iker helped me connect with football and seeing Ronny here at Real, pushed me to grow up as a person who never gives up, so I'm more of a Madridista than you fake guys who only support individual players and only want trophies as a glory hunter. \n\nEven if the mods delete this post, I'll still keep trying to criticise the worst batch of players that this club ever had.",

        "content": "Obviously he ended up becoming a world class player, but I\u2019m curious to hear from those who watched him during his first couple of seasons. Did he start off shaky and make mistakes or was he top tier from the first game? \n\nI remember him being highly regarded as a young player but I don\u2019t recall how he actually performed during his first seasons at Real Madrid.

        "content": "I feel like I\u2019m in anime power scaling community. Fans are divided into defending or attacking players to further their agenda: Vini fans vs Mbappe fans, Bellingham fans vs Arda Guler fans. Every \u201csub fanbase\u201d keeps pushing false narratives, defending their player when they\u2019re indefensible and waiting patiently for the opportunity to attack the other play they hold an agenda for. \n\nStop supporting players and start supporting the club. My favorite player is Valverde but I won\u2019t defend him for his performances this season. I used to defend Vinicius in the past years but it\u2019s indefensible now. I used to defend Bellingham performances but it\u2019s indefensible now. I used to attack mbappe for his start with Real Madrid but he\u2019s turned that around. How can you see Guler play really good and help the team but then you as a Bellingham fan attack him for the first mistake he makes.\n\nThere\u2019s something wrong with fans and it\u2019s gotten out of control. Either support the club or don\u2019t support at all. There are players that cannot be defended, yet their fans wait for the first opportunity for them to drop a good performances in 20 games to tell you how they\u2019re the best in the world. Stop. Just stop.",
