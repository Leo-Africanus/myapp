        "content": "I understand why some people think Arbeloa\u2019s constant praise of Vini is a bit weird or over the top. But honestly, I think it\u2019s very intentional and very pragmatic.\n\nVini\u2019s confidence is clearly at a low point right now, and like it or not, this team still needs him firing if we want to win anything meaningful this season. Everything is still wide open, especially with Barca dropping points. The margins at Real Madrid are always thin, and when Vini is hesitant or mentally checked out, our attack looks predictable and toothless.\n\nYes, the criticism he\u2019s getting is fair. His decision-making hasn\u2019t been great, his body language hasn\u2019t helped, and he hasn\u2019t always responded well to pressure. But singling him out endlessly doesn\u2019t help the team. At this stage of the season, it\u2019s not about who was right or wrong, it\u2019s about putting players in the best position to perform.\n\nI genuinely think Arbeloa is trying to protect and empower Vini, not because he\u2019s blind to his flaws, but because he understands how crucial Vini is when he\u2019s confident and decisive. Whether you\u2019re a Vini defender or a critic, the reality is the same: if he plays well, Madrid\u2019s chances improve dramatically.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to like him. You don\u2019t have to excuse everything he does. But right now, backing him is simply the most pragmatic move for the team\u2019s success, and that\u2019s probably all Arbeloa is doing.",

So, our main problem is the right flank. We could easily fix this, but for some reason we don\u2019t. First, Mbappe can play on the Right Wing. He has played there more than he has on the left. He played throughout his early PSG career, up to 2019 in the right flank. Many claim he can\u2019t, but he very much can. But, let\u2019s say Mbappe wants to stay as a ST. Then we would have to bring Endrick back, and play him as a RW. Who also played a lot as a RW before coming to Madrid. You just need to watch him play to know his quality and how capable he is of playing Right Wing. Our Front Three could easily be Vini, Mbappe, Endrick. We could rotate them with Rodrygo, Gonzalo and Brahim. We would have good competition, and we would be utilizing Endrick who is a great talent.\n\nEdit: I prefer Rodrygo way more, but the board won\u2019t bench Vini.",

It can get dirty with mud, sweat, and even blood, but never of shame,\"\n\nThat is the statement should lived by.",
