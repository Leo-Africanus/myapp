        "title": "About Mbapp\u00e9 and Anfield",
        "content": "Are some people seriously gonna blame Mbapp\u00e9 for recent mishaps??? It\u2019s just so pathetic, is born of player bias and indicates individual failure to recognise mistakes in Xabi\u2019s system. If you watched the build up out of the back at Anfield, it is clear to see a massive errors from how the team set up against Liverpool. As easily as you can blame Mbapp\u00e9, you can blame Vinicius for the loss. But we shouldn\u2019t dwell on such minute matters and instead look at the bigger picture to gain better insight into our problems in the big matches. However, it must be disclosed that these are all in my personal opinion having watched the disaster at Anfield from start to end.\n\n1- To start off, there\u2019s a major problem in escaping presses. Xabi played Trent for a collective total of around 10 minutes in the last two games. His first game fully back from injury was in the most hostile environment in Anfield after his confidence is already being lowered by the starting of Carvajal and Valverde over him. To put it simply, if we don\u2019t play Trent at RB, who was brilliant as allowing Liverpool to escape pressing with his passing range, it just won\u2019t work. The clumping between Valverde, Camavinga and Militao was simply ridiculous at times. Valverde and Camavinga beng desperate to escape the pressure that they found themselves in, were to hit the long balls cross field because the short passing between themselves was going absolutely nowhere.\n\n2- The failures of Vinicius. I have nothing left to say. He\u2019s such a good player but if you\u2019re dribbling the ball out of the game you need to get your head into the bloody game. I see so much criticism of Mbapp\u00e9 when we have Vinicius being given the keys to drive the offence forward against Liverpool and doing jackshit with the role. The diving was flamboyant and unnecessary, he needed to just get his head entirely into the game and not try any funny business.\n\n3- Misusing Bellingham. Real Madrid have an excellent box crasher who can create a target for our wingers but yet he\u2019s forced into a transitional role in build up and his offensive role is neutered because of G\u00fcler\u2019s presence. Anyone who watches the matches can see G\u00fcler is too affected by nerves to be a main creative output in big games. It\u2019s simply just stubbornness to force a square peg into a triangular hole because G\u00fcler is not moulded for the pressure yet. If G\u00fcler cannot handle the pressure in the Santiago Bernabeu (giving the ball away for Barca to score the equaliser in El Classico), what was the reason to start him at an extremely hostile ground in Anfield?\n\n4- Misusing Tchouameni. All I will say is that it seems he is not being found during possession to relieve some pressure even when Xabi wants to pass out the back. We\u2019ve seen from endeavours with France that Tchouameni has the eye for the pass behind when he gets on the ball. Even if we want to pass out the back Tchouameni should be a pivot we turn to because he has the physicality to hold it up and the ability to pass it up the pitch.\n\n5- Horrible substitutions. Xabi should not be waiting until the 80th minute to start substituting players. In addition, the substitutions made no impact because they had no time to. Xabi needs to bring in Gonzalo Garcia or Endrick as well because both bring energy into the match. I can remember Garcia pressing his ass off to meet Barcelona players in their own half when Real Madrid were closing out the game. The importance of energetic presence cannot be understated on modern football and Mbapp\u00e9 and Vini cannot be expected to do such after 70 minutes.\n\n6- The press. Is there even a press in big matches??? Has Xabi told the forwards to save energy for non existent counter attacks? I believe one of Mbapp\u00e9 and Vinicius should be pressing in each defence and the role should be left up to them to decide in lieu of commanded rotation pre and mid match. \n\nTLDR: There are major changes that must be made to roles in personnel and system that have been negatively impacting performances on the big stage. It must be recognised and your mindset needs to change if you\u2019re still riding the Mbapp\u00e9 hate train.",

Over the years we\u2019ve hosted watch parties, sent members to matches, partner with brands - the sort of things a Pe\u00f1a is supposed to do. We\u2019ve gone through the requirements on the official site and we\u2019re confident we meet all of them.\n\nThe issue is with actually getting a reply from the club. Every time we email the Department of Pe\u00f1as, we get one rather hasty reply asking for some info...and that's about it. No follow-up, no progress, fully ghosted. We\u2019ve tried different contact addresses, provided all the details and evidence they could possibly need \u2014 same story every time. It\u2019s been like this for almost three years now.\n\nSo, to those of you who\u2019ve successfully gotten your Pe\u00f1a officially recognized \u2014 is there another way around this, or someone specific we should reach out to? Any insight at all would be super appreciated.\n",

        "content": "What an incredible achievement for 2 of our players. While I am biased and feel our players are heavily underrepresented in media and awards, this is amazing to see. \n\nEveryone here knows my respect for Angeldahl, I don't mention Lakrar quite as much, but that doesn't mean I don't notice her. Lakrar and Mendez, are one of the strongest pairings we've had, certainly up there with Ivana and Peter.\n\nThere are still a couple of others I feel should be on the shortlist, but we can't deny the competition from our rivals over some positions with our top players that would rightly be outvoted on.",

He had left that position far behind before even coming to Madrid. Even at the 2020 Euros, when France had literally Benzema as a striker, they were still playing 3-4-1-2, with both Benzema and Mbappe as CF\n\nIt can also be seen that he has had better stats as CF too.\n\nCompare that to Vini, who won the best player in the world award(FIFA the Best) and came second in Ballon d'Or, being one of the main reason Real Madrid had their most succesful season since the 1960's, as a LEFT WINGER.\n\n  \nVini was straight up the best winger in football, for at least 3 years. Even now he has more G/A than any other winger in the world, except for Bayern's\n\n",
