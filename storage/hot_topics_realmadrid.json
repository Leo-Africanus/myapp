        "content": "3 left-wingers up front only to finish the game with Rudiger as CF when we have a 40m Euro CF on the bench whom we clearly don\u2019t rate in reality\n\nThe injury crisis is unforeseeable but Carvajal hadn\u2019t had a credible back-up in years. His injury came in the last seconds of a game where he was one of FOUR Real Madrid fullbacks (if we count Lucas) on the field?\n\n80m for Tchouameni is 80m that we might aswell have invested in a celebrity crypto coin. \n\nWe have 2 DMs that do not want to be strict, screening DMs, but cannot direct play from deep either. Our entire palate of young/new midfielders offers combined 0 control/retention or dictation of play. \n\nWe are starting 4 vertical runners every match\n\nNacho and Marin were allowed to leave despite not having Alaba back (and he was poor anyway tbh) and Militao\u2019s health being uncertain. Even Rudiger isn\u2019t getting any younger and there is no breakthrough CB unless we count Ascensio who wasn\u2019t even seem as Castilla\u2019s best CB prospect.\n\nWe like to think we are so \u201cwell ran\u201d but honestly if PSG or Chelsea was doing all this we\u2019d rightly sneer at them. This is such a poorly constructed squad. \n\nEDIT: at risk of persecution here: I don\u2019t rate Eder Militao *AT ALL* even before ACLs. His catalogue of ELGs and own-goals is EXTRAORDINARY. Like how is he getting away with this? Catastrophic defender. Another 50m we should have given to Ronaldinho\u2019s cypto coin instead. Also signing Rudiger when we have Militao means our defence will have a \u201cdouble aggressor\u201d pairing leading to dangerous step-ups/disrupted line. Again poor construction. Love Rudiger though tbh.",

        "content": "I'm going to get straight to the point: yes, I accept that our defense is lacking, but we also need to acknowledge that our midfield was effectively shut down. Bellingham disappeared during the game, and Valverde seemed to be running around just covering for Vazquez. Camavinga was put in a difficult position because he\u2019s not someone you can rely on with the ball. \n\nI think Madrid needs to realize that we need a proper midfielder who is skilled with the ball and has great vision. I believe Odegaard could be the answer; I've been watching him since he joined Arsenal, and he has developed really well. He would fit into our team nicely. Additionally, we need a solid defensive option because Mendy is, as far as I know, out of the picture. This way, we can build our attacks from the right-back position with Alexander-Arnold.",

He\u2019s error-prone and he engages in what I always call \u201chalf measures\u201d when completing defensive actions in midfield. \n\nHe also comes across as just lazy and complacent all-round tbf?\n\nI can\u2019t be the only one who really thinks it\u2019s tome we found a buyer? Let this goofer-offer be* PSG or Chelsea\u2019s problem.

        "content": "Especially with the excuses like \"We were gassed\", \"We are in a transition\", \"broo it is what it is, who cares\" etc. and criticizing/ostracizing other Real Madrid fans.\n\nWe care, as Madridistas and it is called having STANDARDS and being a big club. It is a about always wanting to achieve great things.\n\nThis is not a run of the mill club where there are low expectations. This is the biggest club in the world, with players that earn the most money and if you don't want to have standards and high expectations, why are you here? There are thousands of small to mid clubs around the world. And if you love Real Madrid for something else and want to be a Madridista for your own reason, you are welcome but please at least don't try to change our winning culture.\n\nBy the way I am not saying we should panic but who is panicking anyways? This is not panic, this is being passionate and wanting the best, expecting the best. This season, we were FAR from being the best in most major matches. We didn't even get close.\n\nLike I can't fathom my head around how some fans think of Madrid. Where is your fire to stay as the biggest and the better club? Why should Real Madrid ever be content with frequently losing or playing inferior while we have one of the best squads, resources, culture and a heritage in the world?\n\nLike how did we get into a point in this subreddit where if you want the best for Madrid, you looked upon as a weirdo or a doomer?\n\nEdit: I see misunderstandings such as \"You guys can't accept a loss\" and I want to clarify that it isn't about losing games but **how** we lost them. I am %99 sure that people wouldn't be that upset if we played better, put up a fight and still lost. Because losses can and WILL happen, that's a reality but it's how you play and show your character while losing, not going below your standards. One day offs are also okay but it shouldn't come from a systemic error. It is also not this one game and final, we haven't been putting a fight for the most major matches this season.\n\nWe are not putting high standards to our \"winning streak\", we are putting it on how we play and fight. Win or lose, that's just fate but how you win and lose, that can be concerning.\n\nWe grow from these, always do but not via turning a blind eye to how we play. Hala Madrid!",

        "title": "Ancelotti - from a Milan fan",
        "content": "Yes the loss was horrible \n\nYes it was embarrassing \n\nHowever....big picture Carlo has given Madrid a lot. Not just titles he has made Madrid into a dangerous team\n\nI took don't understand why he keeps playing Tchoumeni when he has Ascencio. I think it is a mistake. But Carlo sees things that none of us do.\n\nCarlo had one of the most humiliating defeats in our history. The loss in Istanbul. As a rule, you will get blown out from time to time. I realize that Madrid fans are waaay more demanding than us Milanistas but on balance....you will have more glory.\n\nCarlo avenged 2005 Istanbul with our last ever Champions League trophy. He also did it with a much weaker squad. \n\nI get that at this moment you think that Madrid should sack him.....but Milan's last CL appearance of note was in 2007. Since Carlo's departure we haven't done ANYTHING. Madrid were also struggling to win la Decima before Ancelotti. \n\nHe definitely has his faults and stubbornly sticks to the team that gave him glory. But he's truly a great and elite coach and person. \n\nJust being careful what you wish for.\nI can't see any other coach in the world agreeing to play with such little support after winning so much. Carlo is slowly but surely finding a way to play a forward line with three left wingers. Madrid has had an incredible injury nightmare and you are above Barcelona in the league. \n\nWhen it comes to Carlo, you have to take the good with the bad. Or maybe you can get someone who can do it all. I don't think that person exists. Look at how Pep has been suffering of late....and he spends quite a bit in the transfer market. You think Xabi is your saviour? Time will tell.",

        "title": "Tonight, Mbappe showed up...on his own!!",
        "content": "Can we all appreciate Mbappe? He's probably the only player playing passionately for Madrid in El Clasico tonight. The only player who actually kept trying to do something while everyone else looked like they were young highschool boys ready for bed. Very unfortunate considering that he is finally NEARLY back to his old self and could have potentially scored more goals, yet no one was there to back him up! This was supposed to be a huge game. How in the hell did we not have a proper plan?? \n\nMidfield and especially our NON-EXISTENT defense line in shambles! Embarrassing.\n\nAncelotti is very stubborn keeping his favourite boys in Starting XI and refusing to sub when we have a very talented stacked bench players waiting the whole game. He should be shown the door and take Lucas, Tchou and Mendy out with him. Useless coach.\n\n\n\n",
