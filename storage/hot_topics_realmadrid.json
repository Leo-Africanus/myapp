Thats what people say when explaining his TERRIBLE performances. But the actual truth is, Vini has simply declined as a football player and athlete. He\u2018s not as fast, agile and electric as he used to be and he relied on his athleticism A LOT. He never had the best technique, he was the ultimate kick and run player but he can\u2018t do that anymore. His ball carrying is horrifying, he cant dribble and take his man on anymore, his shooting and his passing is awful and against low block laliga teams he\u2018s damn near a liability because his link up play is bad since he\u2018s shit on the ball. Vini on the left wing used to be the scariedt sight in football. He dominated teams 90 mins long. Watch games from 2 years ago and see how much more fluid and electric he was. Also he was better on the ball. But all of this ended a year ago, he\u2018s not that guy anymore.\nI said this on another post as well. This is the actual truth for Vini\u2018s decline.\n\nI just don\u2018t get how this happened so quickly? Brazilian players just seem to only have 3-4 good seasons in them. Now this guy cant connect two passes and every touch turns into a duel. He plays like he wears jeans. It hurts so much to see him like this but we have to face the truth. He\u2018s way too protected for his bad performances. This is just not Real Madrid level.",

Without Mbappe, Huijsen, Trent, Militao, and Camavinga we were able to press really good and that was reflected on the chances we created and control we had on the match. We\u2019re playing a good Man City side yet we were head to head with them for most of the match despite our struggles on and off the field.\n\nTwo brain dead decisions from Rudiger and absolutely terrible finishing from Vini and Jude cost us the game.\n\nXavi needs to implement his vision with the players he wants. We\u2019re building a team to be able to win more trophies, and we need to trust him with that. We didn\u2019t bring him as a caretaker coach. \n\nWe pressed better today and that showed us results. Imagine if we pressed like this in recent games we played?? Why didn\u2019t we? Apparently we can.\n\nSell the players that are rebelling against his tactics and replace them with ones passionate about this club. For now, move Mbappe to the left and try GG in the 9 spot and play Arda in his fav spot in the center.",

        "content": "I don't want to demonize Vini, I like him since he came to Real Madrid and watched him grow to this day.\n\nHe certainly is a very good player, with such pace, dribbling and stamina. In his early years he always cause threat in big games, even though his shooting was bad at that time.\n\nHis problem really isn't technique, nor does he fear big opponents. It's his mentality of handling interaction both on an off the field. Other than the terrible racism, I guess it has to do with his coaches, Zidane favored Hazard over him, so it obviously made him more sensitive. Carlo gave him a lot of freedom, which is nice but we need something else after he became a top star. We need someone in the middle ground. Flo was also being very supportive to him. \n\nSo he sometimes has poor decision making, like this game. Before this season, he also had little chemistry with the LB. I don't think it's fair to blame it all to Mbappe or someone else. It's a new obstacle that Vini has to conquer after becoming a top star: His own ego. Maybe it's not just him after 23-24 season. \n\nXabi didn't have issue with Vini, he just wanted more discipline and had different approach. Even this season, he had played some very good games.  \n\nVini should have listened, maybe he did, but that outburst really disappointed me, it wasn't something right to do. And Xabi was too easy on it, it must have hurt the morale. It was probably Xabi's biggest mistake so far as well. It would make you lose your ground when you are trying to discipline others.\n\nI don't want Vini to go, not at all. We need him, but he really needs to pick himself up before he became a top star.",

        "content": "I don't understand why people are not talking about it, Almost all of our backline is gone or always under the risk of getting injuries. We need to address this Situation also!\n\nWe need to take difficult decisions to handle our defense injury situation.\n\nFrom past two years there has been acute injuries in the back line resulting into playing different defensive lineup every time, because of this there is not much chemistry and mutual understanding created between the defense, even the chemistry between Courtois and defenders are not on point due to always changing backline.\n\nAlso due to this some players have to play out of position resulting into sub par performance.\n\nWe need to completely revamp our backline with players who are physically strong.\n\nCurrently Rudiger, Militao, Alba, Mendy and Carvajal all have got into multiple injuries and even surgeries.  \nEven the new singings Dean and Trent are suffering from multiple injuries, while Carreras is getting unlucky with getting booked.\n\nI respect their contribution and legacy but now we need to create a lineup which is ready for our next generation.\n\nYou can see how many times they have got injured here.  \n[https://www.besoccer.com/team/injuries-suspensions/real-madrid](https://www.besoccer.com/team/injuries-suspensions/real-madrid)",

        "content": "The overall takeaway from here and the media is basically \u201cparticipating and doing your best is what really matters!! Well done boys\ud83d\ude03\ud83e\udd48\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s just not what Real Madrid were built on. But that\u2019s clearly how far we have fallen. New fans who grew up on trendy \u201cphilosophies\u201d and \u201cdata-driven keep-ball\u201d wanted us to be Brighton so badly.\n\nCongrats cos for now you got what you want. We are Brighton.\n\nYesterday was a garbage performance among many from this set of players, masked by a superficial sense of \u201ceffort\u201d. Horrific defending throughout, and who could take optimism from the performances of Rudiger, Vinicius and Bellingham last night? I thought we had 2 shots on target. I was wrong. We had one shot on target. As the game wore on, Alonso made weird subs again, and reverted back to sterile \u201ctiki taka\u201d. That\u2019s the \u201cpromising defeat\u201d.\n\nAlonso is the most obvious not-for-big-clubs manager I\u2019ve seen since Lopetegui or, elsewhere, David Moyes. And he\u2019ll be gone soon, as those two were. He will be gone in the coming weeks and from there, he will circulate around West Ham, Real Sociedad, Sevilla, like Moyes and Lopetegui.\n\n2 wins in 8. In a run that included Elche, Girona, Celta Vigo, Rayo Vallecano, Olympiakos. Even Liverpool and Man City are in relative downturns. And we lost to both of them. No Real Madrid manager should ever survive that.\n\nBut well, at least we tried(!!)",

        "title": "Why this is happening only in our club? Real Madrid might be the biggest in the world but there are other big clubs in Europe. None of them has this much dressing room issues.",
        "content": "We are a big club with big superstars but that doesn't mean ALL the players playing in other clubs are below our players. There are a lot good players in other clubs as well and no one is causing this much problems in the dressing room.\n\n - We all know Harry Kane is a best striker right now in Bundesliga chasing records and Kompany benched him for few matches especially against Leverkusen where he played completely with the B team. Still no one protested against him or caused problems in dressing room.\n\n - I hope you all remember how Pep subbed out Haaland at UCL after scoring 5 goals(Some say that he didn't want Haaland to break Messi's record which probably might be true as Pep is a biggest admirer of Messi). Haaland didn't even show any sadness. He just whispered in Pep's ears and went to the bench.\n\n - There are a lot of occasions where Kevin De Bruyne is subbed off while carrying the team and Pep didn't hesitate to take him out for tactical purposes. He also made Grealish and Foden play out of positions and they didn't cause any trouble.\n\n- Joao Cancelo voiced his dissatisfaction against Pep and the club immediately sent him on loan and eventually sold him.\n\n- Rashford, Garnacho doesn't work well with Ruben Amorim and Amorim didn't hesitate to be strict with them despite them being well admired players in the club. Now Kobbie Mainoo also voicing his dissatisfaction but Amorim isn't even flinching a bit always making sure the dressing room is not messed up by the likes of these players. Even Senior players like Bruno and Casemiro (Former Real Madrid player for your kind reminder) follows Amorim's instructions properly and gives their best.\n\n- Most recently Salah voiced against Slot and the club immediately backed Slot by not including him in the squad. Salah has done a lot for Liverpool than Vini did under Benzema, Modric, Kroos' mercy. \n\nWith things going well in all these clubs, why our club alone is like this? Our new system is not yet stabilized and the players already causing problems suppressing our growth further. When Cancelo voiced against the manager, club backed the manager. When Salah voiced against the manager, the club backed the manager. Buy why our club alone is like this? We have a team with lot of good players. With the calibre of our team, even our bench players can step in and destroy opponents at any time just like how Bayern does in Bundesliga, if not even better. But this useless ego and undeservingly snatching the starting positions of other deserving players simply harmed the rhythm. Xabi's system is a mixture of both possession and counter press. Both are not easy to master overnight. Without even letting the system settle, how can we sack the manager? Things were good when Bellingham was injured because Arda was the only option of creating chances from number 10 position giving high quality assists. Now Bellingham snatched that position simply for him to score. Nothing else. See how much influence he is having in the dressing room. That simply explains why Carlo couldn't use Arda the entire last season.\n\nXabi's control on the dressing room was good enough at the beginning of the season. You cannot say Mbappe didn't drop deep to create chances. You cannot say Mbappe didn't initiate and involve in the high press of Xabi's system. He did that well and I was personally surprised considering how selfish he was at PSG. Even Vini followed Xabi's instructions at the start. Mbappe's goal against Sociedad was due to Vini's pressing forcing mistake which Mbappe capitalised. When everything was going well, Vini was the one who started all these f*cking rant and the club f*cking backed him despite not apologizing to the manager. After all he had done, he is starting the very next match. No other club does this.\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\n\nEven at Barcelona, when Rashford arrived late at practice, Flick immediately benched him. All these things happen at other clubs because the club backs the manager be it Manchester United (Which had a history of never backing managers), Barcelona, Manchester City, Bayern Munich etc. But our club alone worships the players and not supporting the manager despite him being our club legend and dethroned the dominance of Bayern in Bundesliga.\n\nI really wish the club should step in and back the manager only then these players will realise that ego won't work anymore. Otherwise, these players will have the mentality that they can control any manager they get. Its a critical moment for the club otherwise we're doomed. The players and the manager working together properly will simply solve most of our problems. Its frustrating that such a simple thing is not happening in our club.\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22",
