It is a about having a big club mentality and always wanting to achieve great things.\n\nThis is not a run of the mill club where there are low expectations. This is the biggest club in the world, with players that earn the most money and if you don't want to have standards and high expectations, why are you here? There are thousands of small to mid clubs around the world. And if you love Real Madrid for something else and want to be a Madridista for your own reason, you are welcome but please at least don't try to change our winning culture.\n\nBy the way I am not saying we should panic but who is panicking anyways? This is not panic, this is being passionate and wanting the best, expecting the best.\n\nThis season, we were FAR from being best in most major matches. We didn't even get close.\n\nLike I can't fathom my head around how some fans think of Madrid. Where is your fire to stay as the biggest and the better club? Why should Real Madrid ever be content with frequently losing or playing inferior while we have one of the best squads, resources, culture and a heritage in the world?\n\nLike how did we get into a point in this subreddit where if you want the best for Madrid, you looked upon as a weirdo or a doomer?",

        "content": "Yes the loss was horrible \n\nYes it was embarrassing \n\nHowever....big picture Carlo has given Madrid a lot. Not just titles he has made Madrid into a dangerous team\n\nI took don't understand why he keeps playing Tchoumeni when he has Ascencio. I think it is a mistake. But Carlo sees things that none of us do.\n\nCarlo had one of the most humiliating defeats in our history. The loss in Istanbul. As a rule, you will get blown out from time to time. I realize that Madrid fans are waaay more demanding than us Milanistas but on balance....you will have more glory.\n\nCarlo avenged 2005 Istanbul with our last ever Champions League trophy. He also did it with a much weaker squad. \n\nI get that at this moment you think that Madrid should sack him.....but Milan's last CL appearance of note was in 2007. Since Carlo's departure we haven't done ANYTHING. Madrid were also struggling to win la Decima before Ancelotti. \n\nHe definitely has his faults and stubbornly sticks to the team that gave him glory. But he's truly a great and elite coach and person. \n\nJust being careful what you wish for.\nI can't see any other coach in the world agreeing to play with such little support after winning so much. Carlo is slowly but surely finding a way to play a forward line with three left wingers. Madrid has had an incredible injury nightmare and you are above Barcelona in the league. \n\nWhen it comes to Carlo, you have to take the good with the bad. Or maybe you can get someone who can do it all. I don't think that person exists. Look at how Pep has been suffering of late....and he spends quite a bit in the transfer market. You think Xabi is your saviour? Time will tell.",

Very unfortunate considering that he is finally NEARLY back to his old self and could have potentially scored more goals, yet no one was there to back him up! This was supposed to be a huge game. How in the hell did we not have a proper plan?? \n\nMidfield and especially our NON-EXISTENT defense line in shambles! Embarrassing.\n\nAncelotti is very stubborn keeping his favourite boys in Starting XI and refusing to sub when we have a very talented stacked bench players waiting the whole game. He should be shown the door and take Lucas, Tchou and Mendy out with him. Useless coach.\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "Literally what more do you want me to say. Comes on, defends exceptionally well, no more goals conceded. It's mind-boggling he didn't start. Disgraceful to be honest. If we get another manager after this, the season is pretty much over unless it's Zidane which is likely not gonna be the case. All we had to do was sign someone, just a right back. Never needed to play Tchou at defense when we had Asencio. Infuriating man honestly",

        "content": "I see a lot of people blaming individuals players for this result and I completely understand your anger and frustration. I know most fans don't expect us to win every match and win every competition every season. What we do however expect is to be competitive in every match and every competition. See some good football and great goals and moments and if possible win at least one trophy.\n\nThe last 3 years as a madrid fan, I have to be honest, the football has been dreadful and our performances against the biggest teams have been extremely poor but through moments of individual brilliance we have overcome many adversities. This was largely due to the calibre and characters of the players we had so even though the likes of Nacho, Kroos, Modric, Benzema,Carvajal were getting on in age, they were serial winners who have been there and done it on the biggest stage for multiple years.\n\nIf you remember Rudiger wouldn't even make the starting 11 when he first came and even though we had frailties in our defence Ancelotti refused to make the change, it was forced upon him due to injury to both Alaba and Militao so don't be shocked the same thing is happening with Acensio. Ancelotti also doesn't improve players, he's good at feathering egos and setting the team up but there's so many aspects of the game the team is lacking.\n\nOur pressing is awful and teams can literally split our team open with one pass as evident from the 5th goal they scored. \n\nOur teams shape is completely poor, the players look slow and lack energy and out of ideas. They look completely lost of the pitch and don't seem to understand how to press as a unit. This isn't an individual problem it's a tactical one. Mendy is constantly being left 1 v 1 or 1 v 2 and Ancelotti doesn't do anything to solve this. Vazquez was constantly caught out of position and constantly letting players run between him and Tchouameni and Ancelotti doesn't nothing to solve this.\n\nMajor reason why we won the league last seaosn is due to Barcelona being worse than we are and champions league because of Vini and Bellingham coming up clutch in big games. We rarely keep a clean sheet EVER but we usually win by outscoring the opponent which is not going to work against the bigger teams. Our counter attacking which used to be the envy of teams is now one of the worst I've ever seen because we can barely successfully execute 2 3 passes to setup a counter. Mbappe and Vini rarely track back meaning we are constantly outnumbered when defending.\n\nThis issues are all coaching related because all Barcelona did different from last season to this is change managers and the squad is largely the same. It's almost like our team has no chemistry and no invention, no energy nothing.\n\nAncelotti out.",

Can some Carlo apologist explain to us why and how this team doesn\u2019t have a buildup pattern even after his 3 years?. Before it was pass to kroos or Long balls and after yesterday even Sean Dyche would be embarrassed. Also do tell why this team doesn\u2019t know how to press ever and expectedly got baited and opened up multiple times yesterday.",
