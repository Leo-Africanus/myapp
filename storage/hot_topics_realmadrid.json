        "content": "#FT: OURENSE 1:3 CASTILLA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#1\u00aa FEDERACI\u00d3N\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:** \n\nRed card: Amin Bouzaig (Ourense) 45'+8 \n\n0:1 C\u00e9sar Palacios 57'\n\n0:2 V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as 66'\n\n0:3 Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga (p) 77'\n\n1:3 Kensly V\u00e1zquez (p) 90'+1 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - kickoff, vamos! \n\n\ud83d\udd04 15' - Roberto Mart\u00edn pulls his hamstring after getting tackled in the box, he cannot continue and Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez comes on for him \n\n31' - great save by Fran Gonz\u00e1lez from a short distance to deny Ourense a counter goal \n\n34' - and the next save by Fran on the counter, Castilla looking very vulnerable in defense \n\n41' - something has been getting reviewed in Castilla's box for minutes now, or on the counter that followed, I have absolutely no idea what it's about and neither does the referee from what I can tell \n\n43' - they were reviewing a handball, but there was no handball at all, and even if there had been the referee's decision ended up being a foul by the attacker. This challenge system is absolutely ridiculous and needs to be removed after this season\n\n45'+5 - now Arbeloa is asking for a review on an elbow on David Jim\u00e9nez by Amin, who is already on a yellow \n\n\ud83d\udfe5 45'+8 - straight red card for Ourense's Amin, which is an absolute joke of a decision after another lengthy review. I thought the question was whether to give him a second yellow or not\n\nHT - end of a very disputed first half, where both teams arrived at the opponent's box every other minute. Ourense however had the bigger opportunities, with Fran needing to intervene multiple times to prevent a home lead. Castilla now need to take the great chance to win this match playing 11v10 for the entirety of the second half\n\n46' - second half is underway\n\n54' - incredible triple chance for Castilla, cross by Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez towards the second post, where Manuel \u00c1ngels volley gets saved by the keeper. David Jim\u00e9nez needs to head the rebound past the keeper, but his header hits the bar. Palacios keeps the ball in play with a backheel pass that gets deflected to Manu Serrano, but his shot goes well wide \n\n\u26bd 57' - GOLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - Ourense have a counter, but Joan stops it with a great tackle, the ball either touching his back or his supporting arm on the ground - he plays it to Manuel \u00c1ngel, who finds Serrano on the left wing. His cross is tapped away by the keeper, but Palacios stays calm and finishes the rebound into the top corner \n\n60' - the goal gets challenged by the Ourense coach, but even if Joan touched it with his arm, it was the supporting arm on the ground and not a punishable handball \n\n\u26bd 66' - GOLLL DEL CASTILLA - After a corner, Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez' shot is blocked. The ball comes out to Pol Fortuny, who finds David in the box. He squares it and Valdepe\u00f1as slides it into the net to most likely finish off this match! \n\n68' - the goal gets reviewed of course after another challenge by the desperate Ourense coach, I don't even know what is getting reviewed once again, but it's a clean goal obviously\n\n72' - penalty for Castilla after a very sloppy challenge on Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga \n\n76' - and another lengthy review after yet another desperate challenge by the Ourense coach, but the penalty is given\n\n\u26bd 77' - GOLLL DEL CASTILLA - Palacios originally stepped up to take it, but after the lengthy review, they changed the taker to Loren - he converts into the bottom right corner! \n\n\ud83d\udd04 80' - first (voluntary) subs by Arbeloa, Bruno and Cristian come on for Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga and Manuel \u00c1ngel \n\n\ud83d\udd04 83' - and Arbeloa uses up his contingency to bring on Fortea and Castrelo for Cestero and Palacios \n\n88' - penalty for Ourense after Manu Serrano practically jumps on their players back - and surprise, it's getting challenged and reviewed. This is honestly one of the stupidest football matches I've ever seen in my life \n\n90'+1 - and the decision stands... 5/6 challenges were useless in this match and each one took between 2 and 5 minutes to review, absolute nonsense \n\n\u26bd 90'+1 - Kensly V\u00e1zquez steps up and converts\n\n90'+2 - 8 minutes of added time, should've been double that unironically\n\nFT - and finally this match comes to an end, the referee will be the happiest person now because he can finally stop running to the review screen and back every 5 minutes. Another important win, on the road and in a match that didn't look like it was necessarily going to end in a win during the first half. Castilla now have 3 wins in a row and are just outside the playoff spots after starting last matchday in the relegation zone\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 12:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio O Couto, Ourense \n\n**Referee**: Antonio S\u00e1nchez S\u00e1nchez\n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 1, Matchday 8\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[LaLiga+](https://www.laligaplus.laliga.com/) (subscription - 14.99\u20ac/month) (only available in Spain)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-3-3): Fran Gonz\u00e1lez - Manu Serrano, V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as, Joan Mart\u00ednez, David Jim\u00e9nez - Jorge Cestero (83' Jes\u00fas Fortea), Manuel \u00c1ngel (80' Cristian David), Roberto Mart\u00edn (15' Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez) - C\u00e9sar Palacios (83' Gabri Castrelo), Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga (80' Bruno Iglesias), Pol Fortuny\n\nBench: Guille S\u00fanico (GK), Mario Rivas, Lamini Fati, Diego Aguado. \n\nUnavailable: Sergio Mestre (first team call-up), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Rachad Fettal (injury). \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** LLLWW\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 15th | 9pt | 3-0-4 | 7:9\n",

        "title": "Why this is a oversimplified take on our project so far",
        "content": "I\u2019ve been an avid fan of Managing Madrid for a long time, and I\u2019ve always appreciated Kiyan\u2019s articulate way of breaking things down \u2014 he\u2019s largely responsible for getting me interested in the tactical side of football. Over time, as I\u2019ve learned more about the game, I\u2019ve realized that my eye test has often been fairly accurate in predicting how things will unfold.\n\nWhen we signed Kylian last season, most fans were over the moon, but I was somewhat apprehensive. My concern wasn\u2019t about Kylian himself, but rather that we hadn\u2019t yet found anyone capable of replicating Toni Kroos\u2019s profile \u2014 both on and off the ball. That unease, I think, was shared by many fans and was a recurring theme during Carlo\u2019s final season. It wasn\u2019t rocket science; the imbalance was visible. So, naturally, I was very curious to see how things would develop in Xabi\u2019s first season \u2014 and I\u2019d say it\u2019s gone pretty much as I expected.\n\nOur biggest strength was always the individual quality within the squad. Xabi\u2019s job was to build a framework \u2014 a system \u2014 that could sustain us against well-organized teams able to exploit our weaknesses and craft tactical plans around them. To summarize: Xabi has introduced a pressing structure for when we lose possession, and he keeps our players close together in passing triangles to ensure we always have an outlet under pressure. The intensity of our press varies depending on the opponent, and we alternate between a back three and a back four when defending. The overarching idea is clear \u2014 dominate the ball for as long as possible.\n\nTransfers have been smart and targeted; every summer signing fits the profile we needed. It wasn\u2019t a perfect window, but it was close. The results have been excellent. We\u2019ve dominated most opponents, Thibaut\u2019s workload has dropped significantly, and as Kiyan pointed out, the standout game remains the one at the Metropolitano. That match \u2014 and what Kiyan wrote about it \u2014 is what I want to discuss here. Kiyan wrote:\n\n&gt;  \n*\u201cReminder: There is no such thing as replacing Kroos and Modric. You pivot, secure the best assets possible, and develop what you have. That in part is what is already underway: G\u00fcler has been given the keys to turn into Real Madrid\u2019s midfield magician, and with Bellingham back, they should get enough two-way balance \u2014 especially with a high pressing scheme.\u201d*\n\nI completely agree \u2014 there\u2019s no replacing what Modric and Kroos did for us. Matching their consistency and influence over so many years would be nearly impossible for any player. And we\u2019re not going to find ready-made clones of them on the market either. So trusting our current midfielders is the logical step forward. Jude has shown he\u2019s a generational talent, and Arda\u2019s following the same trajectory. Naturally, the plan should be to play both and prepare them to inherit those roles in time. Simple enough, right?\n\nI\u2019ve always believed that midfield balance defines elite teams more than anything else. Get it right, and you set yourself up for sustained success. Any great modern side \u2014 whether Pep\u2019s Barcelona or Zidane\u2019s Madrid \u2014 proves this. But I also think this balance fundamentally depends on having a double pivot of exceptionally gifted controllers.\n\nNow, by \u201ccontrollers,\u201d I don\u2019t just mean players who are technically excellent or good dribblers \u2014 that\u2019s a common misconception. Arda and Jude both meet those criteria, but being a controller is more than that. Controllers are the rhythm-setters, players who read the tempo of a match and influence the game for the entire team. They position themselves perfectly, adapt to the opposition\u2019s approach, and dictate the pace of play.\n\nLook at the top Champions League contenders this season: PSG have Vitinha and Neves, Barcelona have Pedri and De Jong, Bayern have Kimmich and Pavlovi\u0107. All of them are comfortable in any type of game \u2014 whether facing a low block or an open, chaotic contest. They can play possession-based football or go direct when needed. Their positional awareness and composure allow them to handle physical games, often operating in zones close to their centre-backs.\n\nThere\u2019s a misconception in how we discuss \u201cprogression\u201d in midfield. People tend to project individual traits onto roles: Arda can hit those technical long passes like Kroos, so he\u2019s seen as his successor; Jude can break lines with his athleticism, so he\u2019s the next Modric. But that\u2019s the issue \u2014 those are partial overlaps, not functional replacements.\n\nTake Vitinha\u2019s performance in the Champions League final, for instance. He attempted far fewer long passes than you\u2019d expect from someone of his ability, yet he was the most influential player across every phase of play. That\u2019s the essence of a controller \u2014 someone who can run a game entirely on his own. Naturally, opponents will try to design their game plans to neutralize players like that. This is where the second controller \u2014 someone like Neves, De Jong, or, Modric \u2014 becomes vital. They alternate between attacking and defensive duties, share comparable technical quality, and capitalize on the attention the other draws to keep the team\u2019s rhythm intact. The third midfielder then acts as a balancer \u2014 someone more attack-oriented like Ruiz, or more defensive-minded like Casemiro. But the foundation of control, the heartbeat of the system, always lies in those two primary controllers. \n\nA common criticism of this line of thinking goes something like: *\u201cOther teams didn\u2019t have Modric or Kroos, and they didn\u2019t struggle.\u201d* But that actually proves the opposite \u2014 they didn\u2019t reach the same level of success we did.\n\nTake Liverpool, for example. They kept losing Champions League finals to us because our midfield was simply a level above theirs. Their setup was predictable \u2014 designed to maximize work rate, running, and athleticism. That\u2019s why they thrived in the chaotic, high-tempo environment of the Premier League but struggled against us. We slowed the game down to our rhythm, and they couldn\u2019t cope.\n\nNow look at Arsenal. Arteta has tried to solve the midfield control problem by reinforcing the defense. It\u2019s made them hard to score against, but the trade-off is that they often play too conservatively, even when the opposition is there for the taking. You can see it this season \u2014 they dominate mid-table sides but tend to just hang on for results against top teams.\n\nAnd that brings me to my main point: we have a great squad, but a fixed XI won\u2019t cut it against teams that can switch game states on the fly. Our current tactical framework works brilliantly against midtable opponents because it neutralizes their structure and turns games into battles of individual quality \u2014 something we\u2019ll almost always win. But against elite opponents who know how we\u2019ll approach the game, that predictability becomes a weakness. \n\nArda and Jude are both 10s, but they interpret the role in very different ways. Arda\u2019s the archetypal central attacking midfielder \u2014 think \u00d6zil, James, or \u00d8degaard \u2014 someone who thrives on vision, timing, and the perfect final pass. Jude, on the other hand, reminds me more of players like M\u00fcller or Ferm\u00edn \u2014 late runners into the box, constant goal threats, always sniffing out space.\n\nBoth can defend well and are comfortable with the ball at their feet, but to truly unlock their potential, they need the right supporting cast around them. That balance \u2014 finding the players who complement their styles \u2014 will ultimately be the difference between us being contenders and actually winning everything in the years ahead.",
