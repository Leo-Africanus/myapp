        "content": "After scoring a brace against Talavera in the Copa del Rey, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 has now scored **65 goals** in 2025 for club and country, with 58 for Real Madrid and 7 for France. Among French players, only Just Fontaine in 1958 (66 goals) scored more goals in a single calendar year for a top-five-league club and the national team than Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s 65. His 58 goals for Real Madrid put him just one goal behind Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s club record of 59 goals set in 2013. According to the schedule, Real Madrid will host Sevilla on December 21, giving Mbapp\u00e9 his final chance in 2025 to break Cristiano\u2019s legendary calendar-year club scoring record. Can he do it? How historic would it be if he does?",

Of course, Nacho eventually gained enough experience to become a very fine CB, but that was after a decade learning from the best.\n\nNacho is a horribly underrated player for RM, but players like him who are able to patiently wait and them come in across the backline are generally undervalued in the football world.",

Recent performances by both teams have been inconsistent, and off-field controversies, like the Negreira case, have added complexity to the rivalry.

But also useful in the band in attack. Plus, he can make very good passes and crosses. Still, I think he is wasted in defence and he can do more in attack. But sometimes he is left a bit alone for that in the right side.",

        "content": "Testimony was an hour long. I gather some of the important  bits and translated them. \n\n\nRelationship with Negreira\n\nClaim: Laporta said FC Barcelona never dealt with Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Enr\u00edquez Negreira, only with his son (Javier Enr\u00edquez), who supposedly produced the reports.\n\nContradiction:\n\nFormer president Sandro Rosell testified that Negreira senior personally carried out the reports.\n\nEmails exist between Laporta and Negreira senior, contradicting the claim that they never spoke or dealt with each other.\n\n\nAdditional inconsistency:\n\nLaporta said he didn\u2019t even know Negreira senior was Vice President of the Referees\u2019 Committee, which is widely considered implausible.\n\nWho Supposedly Wrote the Reports\n\nClaim: Laporta said Negreira\u2019s son was responsible for preparing the refereeing reports.\n\nContradictions:\n\nAt the time, Negreira\u2019s son was part of Fenerbah\u00e7e\u2019s coaching staff, raising serious doubts about:\n\nHow he had the time\n\nHow he could perform detailed Bar\u00e7a-specific referee analysis\n\n\nRosell\u2019s testimony directly contradicts this, stating the father, not the son, did the work.\n\n\nExistence and Destruction of Reports\n\nClaim: Laporta said reports were routinely destroyed every five years.\n\nContradictions:\n\nLaporta later appeared at a press conference with red boxes full of reports and CDs, allegedly containing hundreds of reports.\n\nHe even displayed two specific reports from 2012, contradicting the claim of systematic destruction.\n\nHundreds of reports later \u201cappeared\u201d in storage, despite allegedly being destroyed years earlier.\n\n\nKnowledge of Payments\n\nClaim: Laporta said he never knew about the payments or their amounts, because presidents don\u2019t approve all expenses.\n\nContradictions:\n\nHe later stated that any payment over \u20ac3,000 requires board approval, contradicting his earlier claim of ignorance.\n\nHe personally justified a dramatic increase in payments, meaning he must have known about both:\n\nThe existence of the payments\n\nTheir amounts\n\nEscalation of Payments\n\nClaim: Laporta justified quadrupling the payments by saying there were \u201cmore matches and more competitions.\u201d\n\nContradiction:\n\nThis explanation requires detailed knowledge of the payments, directly contradicting his claim that he didn\u2019t know about them.\n\nThe increase (from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of euros annually) is considered grossly disproportionate to any increase in matches.\n\n\nCoaches and the Alleged Reports\n\nClaim: Laporta stated that all coaches received and used the refereeing reports.\n\nContradictions (sworn testimony):\n\nLuis Enrique:\n\n&gt; \u201cIn six years as a coach, nobody showed me a single refereeing report, neither to me nor my staff.\u201d\n\n\n\nErnesto Valverde:\n\n&gt; \u201cI was never offered nor shown any refereeing reports.\u201d\n\n\n\nThese are the primary intended recipients of such reports, making Laporta\u2019s claim untenable.\n\nSuspicious Invoices\n\nInvoice 1 \u2013 \u201cAloe Vera Gifts\u201d\n\nFC Barcelona paid \u20ac60,000 to a Negreira-linked company for an invoice labeled \u201caloe vera gift packs\u201d.\n\nNo credible explanation was provided as to how this relates to refereeing analysis.\n\n\nInvoice 2 \u2013 2010 World Cup Referee Report\n\nBar\u00e7a paid for a report analyzing referees at the 2010 World Cup before the tournament even took place.\n\nThis suggests billing for services that could not yet have been performed.\n\n\nOverall Pattern Highlighted by the Testimony\n\nRepeated use of:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know\u201d\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t my responsibility\u201d\n\n\nContradictions between:\n\nLaporta\u2019s statements\n\nDocumentary evidence (emails, invoices)\n\nTestimony from other presidents\n\nTestimony from coaches\n\n\nA central defense (\u201cthe payments were for reports\u201d) that is directly undermined by every coach who should have received them\n\n\nBottom Line\n\nLaporta simultaneously claims:\n\nHe didn\u2019t know about the payments\n\nHe justified increasing them\n\nThe reports were vital\n\nThe reports were never seen by the coaches\n\n\nThese positions cannot logically coexist.",
