Obviously Mbappe wears the 10 at the french national team, and obviously it fits him, from my point of view the one most likely to receive the number. Tho I do think that I'd eventually Vini will decide to leave us, Mbappe deserves the 7 too. \n\nArda. Arda is obviously the successor of Luka on the pitch, he's an incredible midfielder and obviously one of our biggest talents in this moment. He did wear the 10 at Fenerbache, taking it after \u00d6zil left them, and delivered. I quite doubt the board will give him the 10, as Mbappe probably is the more profitable choice, but Arda would be my personal decision.\n\nBellingham. I put Jude here just for the sake of it, but we clearly know his idol is Zizou, so the 5 is perfect for him, I just had to put him.\n\nMastantuno. Our new signing, I obviously doubt he'd get the 10, perhaps eventually, but not yet, tho, I must say, it would definitely be a big statement from the club, as obviously it would create a \"rivalry\" between him and Lamine, and obviously because the other Argentinan left footed prodigy that arrived to Spain a few years ago wore the 10 at Bar\u00e7a, but yeah, I doubt the board would do that,  I feel that Mastantuno will get the 17 after Lucas leaves.\n\nAnyway, so I hope you enjoyed my post, tell me who y'all think deserves the number 10, Hala Madrid.

        "title": "[OC] [Cristian Salvador] Rodrygo and Real Madrid: On Leaving What You Once Loved",
        "content": "When someone celebrates their birthday in Brazil, it is tradition to give the very first slice of cake to the person you love most. There many other traditions: pull their ears as many times as years he or she is turningalong with other songs and games; but the cake ritual is arguably the most important, and original, of all Brazilian birthday traditions.\u00a0\n\nIn January 2011, at one of the many houses in the industrial and densely populated city of Osasco, in S\u00e3o Paulo, there was once a birthday party; a boy was turning ten.\u00a0\n\nIf it had been appropriate, he would have probably, and happily, given the first slice of cake to a football club. More specifically, to Real Madrid.\n\nThe theme of the party was, after all, quite literally, \u201cRodrygo Real Madrid.\u201d\n\nBrazilian winger Rodrygo has loved Real Madrid as long as he can remember. He hit all the marks of a kid infatuated with a soccer team.\n\nDreams of playing for said club, and an unshakeable drive to fulfill said dream\u2013check.\u00a0\n\nClub's jersey always on\u2013check.\u00a0\n\nWhen he became a professional soccer player, he delayed the final signature that would have had him join a European club just a tad longer, and that week, scored a hat-trick in nine minutes, in the hopes Los Blancos would make a call.\u00a0\n\nDouble check.\n\nThe call happened, too.\n\nIn 2021, he declared his love for Real, anecdotes above included, in a letter at\u00a0[The Players\u2019 Tribune](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/rodrygo-brazil-real-madrid-la-liga-soccer-world-cup). His dream had come true, he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m going to play for Real Madrid.\u201d\n\nRodrygo happily speaks of how his affirmation came true. \u201cWords have power. I\u2019m living proof.\u201d He spoke of his beginnings, the drive to get to the Madrid no matter what, and along with his father, how they had managed to achieved the impossible.\u00a0\n\nAt one point, it all was in the air: a \u201cBig European club\u201d was interested; things were about to be put pen to paper. His father Eric told him to just \"wait a bit more\". Rodrygo did and tried, hard, to make one last statement. That weekend, he scored three goals\u00a0 in nine minutes with Santos in a league win against Vitoria (5-2).\n\nPublications like Marca picked up the story, speaking about \u201c[Barcelona target Rodrygo](https://www.marca.com/en/football/barcelona/2018/06/04/5b14fd58e5fdea002c8b461c.html)\u201d and praising the phenomenal performance of \u201cThe new Neymar.\u201d\u00a0\n\nBy the end of the match, Real Madrid had called Eric, and had asked him if Rodrygo would be interested in joining the biggest club in the world\u2013with Zinedine Zidane as manager.\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w2mcs71p0oaf1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f5a6e135cc81e51866b934472805e72cd4b8dfb\n\nThe answer, and the rest of it, is well known. The arrival, and after barely playing a handful of matches with the B team, the ramp-up to the first team. The trident with Karim Benzema and Vinicius Jr.\n\nTwo goals in two minutes--including that header, and the mayhem which ensued, against Manchester City in the Champions League semifinals.\n\nNow, over 250 matches with Real Madrid and two Champions League trophies, three Ligas and a Spanish Cup, and 33 matches with Brazil later, Rodrygo may be about to make what, to someone who had a Real Madrid-themed birthday at age ten, would be a devastating decision: leaving Real Madrid. Leave to grow; to develop. Leave to be in the World Cup next year under Ancelotti\u2019s orders.\u00a0\n\nThe numbers don\u2019t lie: Rodrygo has just signed his worst goal-and-assists record since he became a starter for Real Madrid four years ago: 25 goals and assists in 53 matches. At any other club, this output could be seen as the result of a\u00a0*robust*\u00a0season.\n\nNot at Real Madrid. And not for Rodrygo, who at age 24, is expected to progressively grow in performance year after year.\u00a0Especially with who is around him at club and national team level.\n\nRodrygo grew up under the shadow of two of the best attacking players of the past 10 years in the sport; Vinicius Jr., and Karim Benzema. Vinicius Jr. attracted so much attention\u2013-and heat\u2013that Rodrygo was allowed to grow at his own pace.\u00a0\n\nThe lack of spotlight seemed to help. Although never a\u00a0*constant*\u00a0performer, Rodrygo has been crucial in key parts of the season for his club, especially in the Champions League, where he found the net 25 times in 64 matches\u2013eight of those goals coming in quarterfinals or farther along. For contrast, he has played two and a half times as many La Liga matches (172) and only scored seven more goals (32).\n\nIt is no secret that Rodrygo is, much like Gareth Bale--another versatile player made right winger--a player who tends to show up in big matches.\u00a0\n\nIt is also no secret that over the past six months, Rodrygo has been close to nonexistent for both the team, the scoresheet, and Ancelotti. The Brazilian winger has tallied one goal and four assists since February (counting the Club World Cup\u2019s assist against Al-Hilal), and was subbed off at half time in the Spanish Cup against Barcelona, with the score 1-0 up for the Catalanes.\u00a0\n\nThat was it for Rodrygo, who missed all five matches in May in La Liga, with Real playing for the trophy. He wasn\u2019t in the list against Celta, with the club arguing the player had a fever. Ancelotti brushed off the questions in the press conference with a mysterious \u201c[When a player isn\u2019t well, they\u2019re not well emotionally](https://sports.yahoo.com/article/carlo-ancelotti-explains-rodrygo-goes-130800669.html)\u201d which left fans and casuals more confused, if anything. For the last four matches of the domestic competition, Rodrygo did not feature at all, including the\u00a0[4-3 loss](https://www.espn.com/soccer/match/_/gameId/705002/real-madrid-barcelona)\u00a0to Barcelona.\n\nIn the Club World Cup, Rodrygo featured in the first match against Al-Hilal. Even though he contributed to his team with an assist in the 1-1 tie, he was back on the bench after 64 minutes. In the third match of the group stages, he barely played 24 minutes.\u00a0Fans and press both expect him not to be of relevance throughout the rest of the tournament.\n\nJust before the first match of the newly formatted competition, Real Madrid manager Xabi Alonso was equally\u00a0[mysterious](https://www.cope.es/programas/tiempo-de-juego/noticias/rueda-prensa-xabi-alonso-real-madrid-17-20250617_3171419.html): \u201cI know what happened with Rodrygo. I can\u2019t tell all of it; he did not go with Brazil to reset his head. We have spoken, we have shared things with one another, and now we are going to put things into action.\u201d\n\nThe Club World Cup is the end of a season which started with Mbappe as the new superstar, Vinicius Jr. continuing to take his preferred spot on the left, and rising talents like Arda Guler, Ibrahim Diaz and even Barcelona-born youth product Victor Munoz, pushing for a place in the starting eleven.\n\nThe list goes on, as Argentinean talent Franco Mastantuono, currently on vacation post-River Plate elimination in the same competition, will be joining Real\u2019s preseason in July.\u00a0\n\nThe problems pile up for the Brazilian. In the horizon, Xabi Alonso enters the scene, fresh off a\u00a0 heroic German stint, and aiming to finally revolutionize the way in which Real Madrid plays, combines, and jumps at the opposition.\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/30i1x54o0oaf1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa3ad242089207f8b1794759f22c0492663ddf19\n\nWhat Xabi may see in Rodrygo is not necessarily what Rodrygo may want him to see. The left winger, even playing out of position on the right, has an innate ability to find the best place to be for a pass which turns into a dangerous opportunity. He has a decent finish (even though he shoots\u2013a lot, regularly in the Top 5 of La Liga on attempts), and is arguably more efficient than his teammates at bringing the ball from the midfield, and into the box.\u00a0\n\nOverall, Rodrygo may be\u00a0*more resourceful and balanced*\u00a0than a player like Vinicius Jr., but he is less regularly impactful than many other players in the team, Vini included. To Xabi, Rodrygo may be a great number 13 player.\u00a0\n\nThe problem is, Rodrygo has left that notion behind. Or at least he is trying to.\u00a0\n\nIt is a fact that Rodrygo could be the best player he can be playing on the left, a position he had featured in since joining Santos at a very young age. That conversation however, with Vini and Mbappe on the team, is a nonstarter. The message from Anceliotti has also been clear: the Brazilian has played five times as many matches on the right, or up front, than in his natural position (43 vs 216).\u00a0\n\nIt could also be argued that an attacking player with the two aforementioned players next to him would find less opportunities to score himself. That is one of the main obstacles Rodrygo has found; the inability to slap his own name on the corner flag and lift it as one of the top players at Real Madrid.\u00a0\n\nThe team seemt to be aware of the situation, too. Jude Bellingham\u2019s\u00a0[comment\u00a0](https://en.as.com/soccer/bellinghams-message-to-rodrygo-only-the-fools-forget-the-r-n/)on social media earlier in the season points at a clear divide between the recognition Rodrygo gets, and what he deserves; a \"Only the fools forget the R\" comment from a colleague for the world to see speaks to a need to counterpoint the public perception of his performance.\u00a0\n\nAs it is often the case in these kinds of situations, over the past several months, rumors have florished--of all kinds. Amongst them, on Rodrygo\u2019s\u00a0[mental health](https://as.com/futbol/videos/la-situacion-de-rodrygo-en-el-real-madrid-ni-problemas-de-salud-mental-ni-quiere-irse-v/)\u00a0and whether he is able to feel at peace with his role in the team. And naturally, transfer rumors, more famously from Saudi Arabia and as of late from North London in England, where Arsenal are reportedly interested. Rodrygo speaks to how happy he is in Madrid, and mentions leaving the rest to his agent\u2013his father.\n\nRegardless of how this all ends, his father probably does know better than anyone the needs of Rodrygo, who is now halfway through his 20s, and slowly but surely entering his prime. The roadmap seems clear: the kid who would walk around the streets of S\u00e3o Paulo with a Neymar mohawk and a Real Madrid jersey will need a club that will appreciate him, and beyond wages, understand he is, and can be, number one on the starting lineup.\n\nThat club will also have to play in Europe, as Rodrygo shines most when the continental floodlights are on; and ideally, it will have a few players he has a connection with, so important with Brazilian players moving to a new country. This was the case for Rodrygo with Real Madrid left-back Marcelo, who for him was \u201c[like a dad](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/rodrygo-brazil-real-madrid-la-liga-soccer-world-cup)\u201d.\n\nAt Mikel Arteta\u2019s club, centre back Gabriel Magalhaes, striker Gabriel Jesus and winger Gabriel Martinelli would prove a great foundation for Rodrygo to ease into in a hypothetical new life in London. Martin \u00d8degaard also knows him from his Real Madrid stint, back during COVID days.\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/he45fl6n0oaf1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47f4dd71b4bf25fd9a7a4f50b2c06e05d7c2367b\n\nAs the current Arsenal squad stands, Martinelli, an established feature on the left for the Gunners, would have to compete for the position with Rodrygo. However, the hypothetical exchange could prove to be a step up for Arsenal in performance, as the Arsenal winger has rendered 16 goals and assists in 3,564 minutes across all competitions this season and Rodrygo has managed 25 goals and assists in 3,448 minutes. Nine more goals and assists in 120 less minutes.\n\nIt is worth noting though, that Rodrygo has managed these numbers while playing on the right, but he is a natural left winger. The potential impact of Rodrygo, in his prime, in his preferred position, and encouraged to play there by his manager is something the player is surely keen to tap into.\n\nIn the meantime and as the situation evolves, Rodrygo features in a Powerade\u00a0[ad\u00a0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12N3lUYclM8&amp;ab_channel=Powerade)about mental health called \"My First Love\"; one where he speaks to his frst love being \u201cFutsal\u201d (indoor soccer), which he considers to be where his mind \u201cGot quicker\u201d, and a sport he considers the \u201cStorm\u201d which turned him into \u201clightning.\u201d\n\nIn the topic of mental health, Rodrygo, like thousands of athletes demanded to perform no matter what they are going through personally, finds himself in a situation where it really isn\u2019t option to speak to whether there is, or isn\u2019t, any issues he is going through. Not without that inevitably turning into a conversation about whether he should continue to play for the giant stage Real Madrid is.\n\nIn the topic of love, and for the sake of the player, his club, his national team\u2013Ancelotti\u2019s future included\u2013and the millions watching, It may very well be time for Rodrygo to make a change, give the slice of cake to someone else, and perhaps make a decision--one that may very well take him away from the club he has loved his entire life.\u00a0\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n*No AI-generated or AI-supported content was used in this piece.*",
