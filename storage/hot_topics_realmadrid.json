        "content": "Our boy had an interview with L\u2019\u00c9quipe and he said some interesting things about us, I havent seen anyone post it here so here's the translation from french:\n\n**About the players:** \n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re missing is just a connection. Between (Kylian) Mbapp\u00e9, Vin\u00edcius, (Jude) Bellingham, Rodrygo. Each one has to know what he\u2019s supposed to do on the pitch. Bellingham has to understand that he\u2019s the playmaker, not the goalscorer. Mbapp\u00e9 is the goalscorer, not the playmaker. Vin\u00edcius isn\u2019t the No. 6; he\u2019s the left winger. As soon as everyone knows what they have to do on the field, that\u2019s it, it\u2019s sorted. Because we\u2019re talking about guys who are among the ten best players in the world, and they\u2019re all on the same team.\u201d\n\n\n\n**Xabi Alonso situation:**\n\n\u201cThe coach can\u2019t do anything. He\u2019s got big names, he picks the best. After that, it\u2019s down to the players\u2026 If your teammate is better than you, you have to accept it. The problem is if you don\u2019t accept that the guy in front of you scores more goals than you. That\u2019s why you have problems when you\u2019ve got five or six great players together. Everyone\u2019s going to bring something. And in the end, the goalscorer will always be a bit more in the spotlight than the others. But he always needs the others! You can\u2019t do everything on your own.\u201d\n\n  \nIt's pretty clear he believes the ones to blame are the players and their lack of chemistry.\n\n  \nSources:  \n[https://www.footmercato.net/a8917801439453191407-karim-benzema-sait-pourquoi-le-real-est-en-pleine-crise](https://www.footmercato.net/a8917801439453191407-karim-benzema-sait-pourquoi-le-real-est-en-pleine-crise)  \n[https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Article/Grand-recit-karim-benzema-qui-peut-refuser-une-coupe-du-monde/1616285](https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Article/Grand-recit-karim-benzema-qui-peut-refuser-une-coupe-du-monde/1616285)\n\n",

        "content": "At this point, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s harsh to say it but our setpiece coach, Jes\u00fas Rueda, has been pretty awful so far. We hired a specialist specifically to fix one of the most obvious weaknesses in the squad, and somehow we look even worse at set pieces than before. Every game feels like a roulette wheel where the opponent just needs one corner to cause chaos. It\u2019s embarrassing for a club at Madrid\u2019s level\n\nDefensively Players look confused, no one knows who\u2019s marking who,(arda tryna mark haaland and vini tryna mark virgil) and we constantly lose duels in the six-yard box. This isn\u2019t about \u201cneeding time\u201d  basic communication and assignments shouldn\u2019t be collapsing this hard. These are the same mistakes we\u2019ve been making for years, and the whole point of hiring Rueda was to finally change that. What exactly has he changed? \n\nOffensively, it\u2019s even worse. How many corners do we waste every match? No creativity, no movement, no planned blocks, no second-phase threat. Just aimless crosses and hoping someone  magically appears in the box. Other teams score off set pieces all the time  meanwhile we look like we don\u2019t even train them sometimes \n\nTbh im suprised this sub hardly mentions him sometimes \n",

        "content": "I\u2019ve been a Madrid fan since 2016. I remember my first season as a Madridista and Rafa was managing, and we got absolutely smashed 0-4 by Bar\u00e7a. The local newspaper in my country ran the headline: \u201cReal mess at the Berna-boo\u201d. Lmao. That was a weird time for me bcuz I\u2019d just started supporting the club, and we were kinda bad.\n\nThen Zizou came in. The night against Wolfsburg made me a true Madridista. Keep in mind, that came after a 2-0 first-leg defeat, and people were calling Madrid \u201crotten\u201d after La D\u00e9cima, saying we\u2019d probably go a decade without winning unless the stars fixed their attitude.\n\nWe won the 11th that year. The 12th the following year. And another Champions League the season after that. Three in three. It still blows my mind we did 3 in 3. Most clubs can only dream of playing in the semis, let alone winning it three times in a row.\n\nBut during those three years, there were defeats. A lot of noise. We\u2019d fall out of the Copa del Rey. For example, Ronaldo was compared to Paulinho in 2018 who\u2019s barely on anyone\u2019s radar now by the way.\n\nMy point is that in hindsight, It's always just noise my hermanos. Always noise. The whole world waits for these bad phases.\n\n(I hope I used the term hermanos right).\n\nWe\u2019ve always had problems. But Real always comes back. ALWAYS. So stay calm. I get it we\u2019re all down right now with everything going on. But honestly, like I\u2019ve always seen, it\u2019s not that bad. It\u2019s just blown out of proportion. \n\nYou are a fan of the biggest club in the world. THE BIGGEST. So whenever we hit a rough patch, it looks catastrophic. And that\u2019s the price we pay for being the greatest.\n\nSo chill. We\u2019ll be back. I know we will. This club has made me sad, but has never let me down! I love Real so much man. I don't care they are bad for a little while right now. A big trophy will come in and we'll all be fine. And then we'll lose against Eibar or someshit and then we'll all go back to being sad again \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nHalaMadrid \ud83e\udd0d",
