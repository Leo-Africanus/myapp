Only reason im suggesting this lineup is cause we cant keep mbappe as striker if we expect to suceed in the long run. I know mbappe is good but he just doesnt do what we need from a striker. I think G.Garcia should start so we can see more from him especially since this next game should be an easy win. I put mbappe on the rw cause he's clearly capable of playing there, not to sure of the midfield tho just wanted to see what you guys thought. Just tried to have a civil convo about my criticisms for madrid with a fellow fan on tiktok and he decided to be delusional and just respond with a pic of previous matches where we won against barca as if that's all this club should care about. He seemed to think that just cause we beat barca, we could beat anyone and win the ucl(even though it's very very obvious that id we keep playing the way we play against big teams, we are definitely not winning the ucl) Please feel free to share your thiughts WITHOUT being rude",

The goal looked like offside to me, and it came off a free kick that was never a foul and even a yellow for Y\u00e1\u00f1ez - the end of this first half could not have been more frustrating\n\nHT - an incredibly unjust result after a first half that has seen Castilla create, but miss a number of chances, as lapses of concentration in the defense by Castilla allow M\u00e9rida score with their only two opportunities, in the shape of a center back that has now doubled his total career tally with this match. A big reaction needed to forget these disappointing minutes by the team\n\n46' - second half underway \n\n\ud83d\udd04 57' - Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga off for Bruno Iglesias \n\n70' - phenomenal save by Fran from a short distance after M\u00e9rida's Chiqui runs all by himself into our box on the counter \n\n\u26bd 73' - absolutely no words, Valdepe\u00f1as wants to play the ball back to Fran, but completely mishits it and lobs it over him into our own goal. Schoolboy error to even play the ball straight at goal, and a grave technical mistake on top. A match to quickly erase from the memory for Castilla\n\n\ud83d\udd04 74' - Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez off for Leiva\n\n\ud83d\udd04 86' - Joan and Palacios off for Manu Serrano and Mesonero \n\n\ud83d\udfe5 90'+5 - disgusting and disgraceful challenge by David Jim\u00e9nez, who kicks the M\u00e9rida player into the knee on purpose. This should be a lengthy ban for him, which is especially painful in the absence of Fortea, leaving the team without a right back \n\n\ud83d\udfe5 90'+5 - a big fight breaks out, with even the police on the pitch, Manuel \u00c1ngel gets a red card\n\n\ud83d\udfe5 90'+8 - for some reason, Arbeloa asks for a review despite the clarity of the red card, escalating the situation further. Palacios said something to the referee, and he also gets a red\n\nFT - a disgraceful, unprecedented end to this match and to Castilla's winning streak. With potentially multiple game bans coming for Jim\u00e9nez and Manuel \u00c1ngel, and likely a single match ban for Palacios, this match might just ruin the next stretch of matches as well. Arbeloa needs to keep his team in check, this cannot ever happen again. The fact he challenged the red card at the end, letting things escalate even further should make him question himself in the process too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 12:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Romano Jos\u00e9 Fouto, M\u00e9rida \n\n**Referee**: Rub\u00e9n Ruip\u00e9rez Mar\u00edn\n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 1, Matchday 11\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[LaLiga+](https://www.laligaplus.laliga.com/) (subscription - 14.99\u20ac/month) (only available in Spain)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-3-3): Fran Gonz\u00e1lez - Diego Aguado, V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as, Joan Mart\u00ednez (86' Manu Serrano), David Jim\u00e9nez - Jorge Cestero, Thiago Pitarch, Manuel \u00c1ngel - C\u00e9sar Palacios (86' Dani Mesonero), Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga (57' Bruno Iglesias), Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (74' \u00c1lvaro Leiva) \n\nBench: Guille S\u00fanico (GK), Mario Rivas, Lamini Fati, Cristian David, Pol Fortuny.\n\nUnavailable: Sergio Mestre (first team call-up), Jes\u00fas Fortea (injury), Roberto Mart\u00edn (injury), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Rachad Fettal (injury). \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** WWWDW\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 4th | 18pt | 6-0-4 | 13:10\n",

Since Adidas is having a great sale on last year's stock, this is the perfect opportunity to upgrade. If I purchase the authentic version also in size L, will it simply fit a bit tighter and more tailored than the replica L, or will the difference be significant enough to warrant sizing up?\nI am strongly leaning toward the authentic jersey because, to my eye, they simply look 100 times better than the standard, normal ones. The quality of the materials, the heat-pressed crests, and the overall slimmer cut make them a much more premium item that I'd love to add to my collection while the sale lasts. I need to be sure about the fit before I commit to the purchase.",

        "title": "About Mbapp\u00e9 and Anfield",
        "content": "Are some people seriously gonna blame Mbapp\u00e9 for recent mishaps??? It\u2019s just so pathetic, is born of player bias and indicates individual failure to recognise mistakes in Xabi\u2019s system. If you watched the build up out of the back at Anfield, it is clear to see a massive errors from how the team set up against Liverpool. As easily as you can blame Mbapp\u00e9, you can blame Vinicius for the loss. But we shouldn\u2019t dwell on such minute matters and instead look at the bigger picture to gain better insight into our problems in the big matches. However, it must be disclosed that these are all in my personal opinion having watched the disaster at Anfield from start to end.\n\n1- To start off, there\u2019s a major problem in escaping presses. Xabi played Trent for a collective total of around 10 minutes in the last two games. His first game fully back from injury was in the most hostile environment in Anfield after his confidence is already being lowered by the starting of Carvajal and Valverde over him. To put it simply, if we don\u2019t play Trent at RB, who was brilliant as allowing Liverpool to escape pressing with his passing range, it just won\u2019t work. The clumping between Valverde, Camavinga and Militao was simply ridiculous at times. Valverde and Camavinga beng desperate to escape the pressure that they found themselves in, were to hit the long balls cross field because the short passing between themselves was going absolutely nowhere.\n\n2- The over reliance on Vinicius. We can\u2019t look for the left flank everytime to create chancesfor our team. Especially at Anfield he needs someone to help relieve pressure so he can play at his absolute best- which is genuinely unstoppable. He\u2019s such a good player but if you\u2019re dribbling the ball out of the game you need to get your head into the bloody game. I see so much criticism of Mbapp\u00e9 when we have Vinicius being given the keys to drive the offence forward against Liverpool and doing jackshit with the role. The diving was flamboyant and unnecessary, he needed to just get his head entirely into the game and not try any funny business.\n\n3- Only one of Bellingham or G\u00fcler should be playing in the middle, not both. Both players have extremely different styles of plays and different talents to offer in the attack but want to occupy the same area of the pitch in possession. I think playing both sacrifices the potency of one of them so it\u2019s an \u201ceither or\u201d situation.\n\n4- Misusing Tchouameni. All I will say is that it seems he is not being found during possession to relieve some pressure even when Xabi wants to pass out the back. We\u2019ve seen from endeavours with France that Tchouameni has the eye for the pass behind when he gets on the ball. Even if we want to pass out the back Tchouameni should be a pivot we turn to because he has the physicality to hold it up and the ability to pass it up the pitch.\n\n5- Horrible substitutions. Xabi should not be waiting until the 80th minute to start substituting players. In addition, the substitutions made no impact because they had no time to. Xabi needs to bring in Gonzalo Garcia or Endrick as well because both bring energy into the match. I can remember Garcia pressing his ass off to meet Barcelona players in their own half when Real Madrid were closing out the game. The importance of energetic presence cannot be understated on modern football and Mbapp\u00e9 and Vini cannot be expected to do such after 70 minutes.\n\n6- The press. Is there even a press in big matches??? Has Xabi told the forwards to save energy for non existent counter attacks? I believe one of Mbapp\u00e9 and Vinicius should be pressing in each defence and the role should be left up to them to decide in lieu of commanded rotation pre and mid match. \n\nTLDR: There are major changes that must be made to roles in personnel and system that have been negatively impacting performances on the big stage. It must be recognised and your mindset needs to change if you\u2019re still riding the Mbapp\u00e9 hate train.",
