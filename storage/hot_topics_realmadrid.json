        "content": "First of all, this is how I would prefer the line up to be. Now back to the main point of this post, the goals predictions which are just based off of previous seasons (mainly last season of course).\n\nThe CBs and full backs with 3-4 goals, mainly from set pieces and for the full backs from overlaps. Nothing outrageous.\n\nThe midfielders with 6-7 goals pretty realistic in my opinion. Jude will drop because he'll miss about 5 matches or so and will slowly be included in the starting XI by like match 9 or so plus he's not going to be as high up the pitch as he used to be, even like last season. \n\nNow the attackers... Vini with 17 is achievable for him. Mbappe with 29, less than last season which happens usually from stars who join other leagues like Haaland and Kane who had crazy first seasons but, in the 2nd, they scored a bit less. I think it'll be same for Mbappe.\n\nWhat do you think? Agreed? Tell us.",

        "content": "\t\u2022\tHow are you approaching your debut at the Bernab\u00e9u?\n\u201cWe all approach it with anticipation, excitement, and eagerness to start the season. These past two weeks have been short but intense, and we already want to step onto the Bernab\u00e9u. We want to start well. The first match is always important. Tomorrow is the day.\u201d  \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tHow have you seen Mastantuono?\n\u201cThe first time I spoke with him, his personality surprised me a lot. He was only 17 and yet carried himself like a man\u2014very sure of himself. He had no hesitation about taking the step to come to Real Madrid. You can sense that maturity, that drive, that quality. He will integrate very quickly into the team.\u201d  \ufffc \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tWhat level of identity does your team have?\n\u201cWe\u2019re making progress. It\u2019s difficult to measure exactly, and I\u2019m sure we still have a few steps to take. But the main ideas were already introduced during the Club World Cup, and over these past two weeks we\u2019ve worked on them even more. The feeling is positive.\u201d  \ufffc \ufffc \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tIs the squad finalized? Could there be departures?\n\u201cI count on all the players who are here, and I want them all at 100%. We need them. Right now, I count on everyone.\u201d  \ufffc \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tThere\u2019s strong competition at right back\u2014do you know who will start?\n\u201cI\u2019m clear that that is excellent competition. I love that in every position we have two capable players. Sometimes I\u2019ll have to make selections, but we have depth in every position. Carva (Carvajal) is getting closer to his top level, which is great for the team. We have many matches ahead.\u201d  \ufffc \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tHow do you feel about the match not being postponed?\n\u201cNow the schedule is unchangeable, but our request\u2014mainly for the players\u2019 health\u2014would have been nice to have supported. It couldn\u2019t be done. We\u2019ve only had two weeks, and there are no excuses. The team can compete tomorrow. Heart and desire push more than the legs.\u201d  \ufffc \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tThe Miami match\u2014does it distort the competition?\n\u201cI fully agree with the club\u2019s statement. If rules are changed, it must be by unanimous agreement of all participants. Right now, that\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d  \ufffc \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tWhat do you think of the phenomenon Lamine Yamal?\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a pressure meter\u2026 He is becoming a key player for both Bar\u00e7a and the national team. The time to face him will come.\u201d  \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tHow have Vinicius and Mbapp\u00e9 taken on the message?\n\u201cIt\u2019s about all lines being aware. For forwards, it\u2019s important that when we transition defensively they don\u2019t get left behind\u2014and also that when we attack, the defense pushes forward. We want to function as a team. That will help us maintain better structure defensively and offensively. We took a step forward during the Club World Cup, and it\u2019s something we\u2019ve been working on.\u201d  \ufffc \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tWhat promise can you make to the fans?\n\u201cI\u2019m more of a doer than a speaker. Promising before doing doesn\u2019t usually work in football. We also have a lot of desire and energy to bring to the stadium\u2014and deserve it. Saying it doesn\u2019t make it so. We want to begin that journey tomorrow.\u201d  \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tHow do you choose the \u2018defensive boss\u2019?\n\u201cThat has to come naturally. It has to emerge organically from the players. We have communicative players who are asserting themselves quickly. Leadership should emerge from what you project, not impose. There may be more than one leader.\u201d  \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tRefs?\n\u201cWe begin the season, and we\u2019ll see how things go. Hopefully, we won\u2019t have to talk about referees.\u201d  \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tHow is Rodrygo? What role do you envision for him?\n\u201cThere are many rumors in summer. I\u2019ve seen he\u2019s in good shape. I count on everyone, and I want them to feel for and belong to the team\u2014and be at 100%. That\u2019s what concerns me and occupies me now.\u201d  \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tMallorca\u2013Bar\u00e7a controversy?\n\u201cIt\u2019s not up to me to comment on what happens in other matches, but I listened to what Arrasate said, and he explained it very well.\u201d  \ufffc \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tWhat can Mastantuono bring?\n\u201cHe could have minutes tomorrow. He will provide quality, energy, is defensively committed, has good drive. I\u2019ve seen in him that Argentine fighting spirit. He\u2019s good with the final pass. He\u2019s at a very good level.\u201d  \ufffc \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tBrahim\u2014how surprised are you by him?\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen him in good form. I already knew how he thinks about his position. He excels in tight spaces. He didn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d  \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tMastantuono said Messi is the best in the world\u2026\n\u201cI can see it makes sense that his favorite player is Messi. Being Argentine, that\u2019s not a surprise to me.\u201d  \ufffc \ufffc\n\t\u2022\t11 years since your last match as a player for Madrid?\n\u201cI have very good memories. I returned with Bayern and felt the love. Now my role is different, but I\u2019m expectant and motivated\u2014eager to feel that connection with the fans again. Let whatever happens, happen\u2014and let them feel whatever they want to feel. I\u2019m happy to be back.\u201d  ",

From what I\u2019ve gathered, he made Madrid competitive again, especially against Barcelona, and his time is still remembered as one of the most intense and successful periods in recent history.",

Guler is meant to play in the midfield by Xabi but probably until Bellingham returns. I think he thinks to play Mastantuono rather than Guler, so it looks like they will competete to get jersey on the pitch. Who will play ahead of whom do you think?",

He\u2019ll be 34 in 2026, and even if he continues strong for a few more years, the club should start thinking ahead to who will eventually step into that role. Real Madrid have usually planned big when it comes to goalkeepers (Casillas, then Navas, then Courtois), so it makes me wonder: who should be next in line once it\u2019s \u201ctime\u201d?",

        "content": "There\u2019s a reason Perez put a 1B buy clause on him. During last injury prone season, he stepped up and delivered as the CB at interim. Big games and league games, fantastic performances and passion in excess\u2026 Despite the questionable performance in the CWC, the potential of Raul is enormous. Everyone seems to have shoved him under the rug after the two bad games. I honestly believe he could become a Ramos type defender for Madrid with enough finetuning and training + experience. He\u2019ll probably serve as a sub for Militao or Huijsen\u2026. Although Xabi is really flexible and determines lineups tailored to opponents so maybe in 3CB\u2019s we\u2019ll see him play and Tchoua back in supportive midfield role. If he gets the playtime he needs and is able to be more careful we\u2019re in for a treat.",
