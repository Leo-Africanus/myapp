        "content": "#FT: JUVENIL A 5:2 OM\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#UEFA YOUTH LEAGUE \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:**\n\n1:0 Thiago Pitarch 17'\n\n1:1 Mohamed Baradji 25'\n\n2:1 Anis Doubal (own goal) 27'\n\n2:2 Tadjidine Mmadi (penalty) 42'\n\n3:2 Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (penalty) 53'\n\n4:2 Diego Mart\u00ednez 'Beto' 80'\n\n5:2 Adri P\u00e9rez 90'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - kickoff, vamos! \n\n\u26bd 17' - GOLLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - Arnu steals the ball from their defensive midfielder, and quickly plays it to Thiago at the edge of the box. He takes a few quick touches to create space, and then cuts his shot across, low into the far corner\n\n\u26bd 25' - goal for OM - Illia punches away a free kick poorly, then their player takes a shot and it hits the post - the ball bounces to Baradji, who takes a little touch, and Joan Mart\u00ednez can't clear it off the line in time (and even then it would've bounced back into the net again), what a crazy and unfortunate goal\n\n\u26bd 27' - GOLLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - and right in the next attack, Fortea advances on the right wing - his powerful and low cross gets deflected into the near corner by Marseille's Doubal! \n\n42' - penalty for OM after a foul by Rivas \n\n\u26bd 42' - Mmadi converts\n\nHT - half time in a very open match where most dangerous situations ended up being goals on both ends - the goals we conceded were entirely avoidable, and the team needs to pay special attention to defending set-pieces better or preventing them from happening in the first place\n\n46' - 2nd half underway \n\n51' - penalty for Juvenil A after Y\u00e1\u00f1ez gets tripped in the box! \n\n\u26bd 53' - GOLLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - Y\u00e1\u00f1ez takes it himself and converts! \n\n\ud83d\udd04 59' - Rivas and Cestero off for Valde and Beto \n\n\ud83d\udd04 71' - Y\u00e1\u00f1ez off for Gabri Valero\n\n\u26bd 80' - GOLLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - golazo de Beto! free kick from around 20 metres out, and Diego Mart\u00ednez strikes it right into the top corner on the goalkeeper's side of the goal! \n\n\ud83d\udd04 83' - last subs, Ciria and Arnu off for Adri P\u00e9rez and Jacobo\n\n\u26bd 90' - GOLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - and the cherry on top, after a dribble by Gabri Valero, he crosses the ball low into the box - it gets deflected towards the far post by the defender, where Adri appears to head it into the net\n\nFT - a calm and controlled second half by the team makes the match end with a comfortable scoreline - they had OM under control defensively much more than in the first half and pounced in the decisive moments in attack. We will get to know the opponents in the Round of 16 and the possible path through the rest of the tournament on Friday\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 16:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee:** Sam Barrott (ENG) \n\n**Competition:** UEFA Youth League, Round of 32\n\n**Viewing options:** [RMTV/RM PLAY](https://play.realmadrid.com/home)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Juvenil A XI (4-3-3):** Illia Voloshyn - Diego Aguado, Mario Rivas (59' Victor Valdepe\u00f1as 'Valde'), Joan Mart\u00ednez, Jes\u00fas Fortea - Jorge Cestero (Diego Mart\u00ednez 'Beto'), Carlos D\u00edez, Thiago Pitarch - Alexis Ciria (83' Adri P\u00e9rez), Adri\u00e1n Arnuncio \u2018Arnu\u2019 (83'' Jacobo Ortega), Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (71' Gabri Valero)\n\nBench: \u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez (GK), Melvin Ukpeigbe, \u00c1lvaro Lezcano, Pol Dur\u00e1n. \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro L\u00f3pez\n",

        "content": "\u201cReal Madrid\u2019s decline over the last 18 months goes beyond tactics or a manager. It\u2019s not one player that is the issue. It\u2019s not one bad transfer window. It\u2019s a variety of different reasons and some of the cultural issues at board level weigh heavy. \n\nI can\u2019t help but think about the \u201cdelayed bill\u201d from a squad building model that looked ideal even just a few years ago. \n\nThe Youth Transfer Policy was a resounding success but has now become part of the current decline.\n\nThe youth policy or \u201cBaby Galacticos\u201d optimized for talent + resale. The board went with the \u201ccream rises to the top\u201d philosophy but never cut out duplicative roles and skill sets. Forcing managers to put round pegs in square holes.\n\nJoselu is one example. A journeyman who played at seven different clubs in Spain, England, and Germany before finally returning to his dream club. That journey gave him perspective. He knew his role and knew what he could provide to the team. He didn\u2019t take the RM chance for granted. \n\nLuka Modric, another example. Would he be signed today given the new policy? 27-years-old from a Premier League club for big money yet not a commercial super star? The policy would have rejected the most decorated player in RM history.\n\nElite talent isn\u2019t enough. You still need veterans with perspective, role players who accept limits and know their limits. Many within the squad aren\u2019t as good as we thought they were. The reality is some hard decisions need to be made this summer. They may not be good decisions from a commercial perspective, but the right decisions from a sporting perspective. This is salvageable. The model can still work but it needs to be less stringent and open to different profiles: technical profiles, age curves, role expectations, etc.\u201d\n\nThought this was a really good piece that sums up our problem perfectly and would give the full article a read if you have the time.",

He has all the tools to be a great defensive midfielder: he has an insane motor, he can tackle, he can shoot from far, he can pass, he can dribble... I don't know why he hasn't become the player we all envisioned. Is it because he likes partying? Is it because he's injury prone? I really hope that for our sake he turns it around. I do think that he has a very high ceiling as a player, but the floor is pretty abysmal.  At this point I'm open to the team selling him, but he's the one player I'm most scared of losing because he has shown flashes of greatness and it would suck for him to become a world class player for another team after all the opportunities he had here.

Essentially what I'm asking is, would you like to see 7/8 min videos breaking down team performance, important moments, tactical mistakes and so forth? \n\nThere will be no player ratings or favouritism shown toward any players. It'll be strictly objective analysis. How many of you guys would like to see something like this? If you would, please let me know what you'd like to see and express your interest in general. \n\nI'm asking because it'll take me around 2/3 hours of editing, but it'll be good for the sub (at least I think so). \n\nI can start out with Benfica Vs Real. \n\nLet me know folks. \n\nHala Madrid!",

        "title": "Kylian Mbappe refusing to track back after dean misplaces his pass",
        "content": "There is so many thing wrong in this video. Dean lying down on the ground knowing that rayo are going to counter attack. Mbappe throwing hand in the air knowing that he can track him. To be honest It is bound to happen because you can't simply change the habit of the player. I love mbappe a lot but thing like this make me question a lot of thing. From past la liga games he is looking so stiff. He loses the ball more often and refuse to cover the space. Even against benfica arda had to move up to cover the diagonal space of benfica cb and cm. If mbappe did not bother to do that then we could've extra man in midfield which is something we needed against benfica. There is a reason why team make a lot of channel run against the team for which mbappe plays. Edin Terzi\u0107 ( Dortmund coach who took them to ucl final 2024 ) also explained that mbappe lack of defending attitude boost their plays A LOT. You will always see our opponent make channel run with their 10 or 8. I know at the end of season this thing will be ignored because ofcourse someone else will get blamed but its not coincidence that our chemistry is 50% worse than what it used to be in 2024 ucl winning season. What do you all think about this? Pls give me your opinion as well.\n\n  \n",

As a matter of fact, a few weeks before he got sacked Jude said that he would play anywhere the coach wants him to play even though he likes scoring goals. You're telling me all it takes is a few sources to say that he was against xabi and now the whole fanbase turns on him and whistles him while he's injured? Because as far as I know I never saw any tier 1 sources say he was against xabi so all this hate I've been seeing since last month is mind boggling. ",

        "content": "I really don\u2019t understand the hate on Mbapp\u00e9 everywhere and moreover in this sub. People tend to compare him to Ronaldo where there is no point to do it with the goat.\n\nRemember also that CR7 had actually legends surrounding him while playing in RMA and I don\u2019t think you can compare the current roster to the likes of Bale, Benzema, Toni Kroos, Luca Modric, prime Isco, Sergio Ramos, Pepe, Angel di Maria\u2026.\n\nI read a lot about his lack of defense, which I can agree, but isn\u2019t he a striker? Do we expect striker who\u2019s averaging more than 1 goal per game to handle defense? It really reminds me of Juventus fans telling it\u2019s CR7 fault while the team was so much worse than what he used to have even if he was top scorer of Serie A.\n\nAlso bear in mind that they are all playing every 3 days and if he were to attack and defend every time, trust me you\u2019ll not see him healthy a lot. You can see how many times Jude was injured and still is while he\u2019s physically more than gifted. Football is not NBA, and you cannot put on a bench a player to rest and expect him to come back later in the game.\n\nJust a rant because I\u2019m kind of sad and annoyed to see all those negative comments with people who know football through instagram reels or are playing too much FIFA.
