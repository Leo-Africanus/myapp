        "content": "There is so many thing wrong in this video. Dean lying down on the ground knowing that rayo are going to counter attack. Mbappe throwing hand in the air knowing that he can track him. To be honest It is bound to happen because you can't simply change the habit of the player. I love mbappe a lot but thing like this make me question a lot of thing. From past la liga games he is looking so stiff. He loses the ball more often and refuse to cover the space. Even against benfica arda had to move up to cover the diagonal space of benfica cb and cm. If mbappe did not bother to do that then we could've extra man in midfield which is something we needed against benfica. There is a reason why team make a lot of channel run against the team for which mbappe plays. Edin Terzi\u0107 ( Dortmund coach who took them to ucl final 2024 ) also explained that mbappe lack of defending attitude boost their plays A LOT. You will always see our opponent make channel run with their 10 or 8. I know at the end of season this thing will be ignored because ofcourse someone else will get blamed but its not coincidence that our chemistry is 50% worse than what it used to be in 2024 ucl winning season. What do you all think about this? Pls give me your opinion as well.\n\n  \n",

        "content": "I really don\u2019t understand the hate on Mbapp\u00e9 everywhere and moreover in this sub. People tend to compare him to Ronaldo where there is no point to do it with the goat.\n\nRemember also that CR7 had actually legends surrounding him while playing in RMA and I don\u2019t think you can compare the current roster to the likes of Bale, Benzema, Toni Kroos, Luca Modric, prime Isco, Sergio Ramos, Pepe, Angel di Maria\u2026.\n\nI read a lot about his lack of defense, which I can agree, but isn\u2019t he a striker? Do we expect striker who\u2019s averaging more than 1 goal per game to handle defense? It really reminds me of Juventus fans telling it\u2019s CR7 fault while the team was so much worse than what he used to have even if he was top scorer of Serie A.\n\nAlso bear in mind that they are all playing every 3 days and if he were to attack and defend every time, trust me you\u2019ll not see him healthy a lot. You can see how many times Jude was injured and still is while he\u2019s physically more than gifted. Football is not NBA, and you cannot put on a bench a player to rest and expect him to come back later in the game.\n\nJust a rant because I\u2019m kind of sad and annoyed to see all those negative comments with people who know football through instagram reels or are playing too much FIFA.

        "title": "Natural Positions Matter: Why Real Madrid Is Fighting Itself Before the Opponent",
        "content": "There is a fundamental, structural problem at Real Madrid that goes far beyond form, tactics for a single night, or one or two bad results. The real issue is much simpler and much more damaging: almost no one is playing in their natural position. That's the main problem.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a minor detail. It\u2019s the foundation of football. When players are constantly shifted away from where they are best, the game inevitably becomes chaotic, forced, and frankly hard to watch. Just ask yourself: how many players in this team are actually playing in their true, natural roles right now? Two? Three? Maybe fewer?\n\nWhat makes this even harder to understand is the club\u2019s transfer policy. How did Madrid end up with so many players of the same profile, in the same zones of the pitch, while neglecting clear positional balance? Multiple similar players competing for unnatural roles, while obvious positional needs are patched together with improvisation. It\u2019s confusing, and it shows on the pitch.\n\nThe consequences are no longer just tactical beause players are human. More than half of the squad is operating outside their natural position, and it\u2019s clearly taking a toll. These are elite professionals, genuinely top-class players one by one. But they hate being trapped in roles that don\u2019t suit them. Not because they lack of discipline, but because they know they\u2019re being prevented from showing their top performance and level. This makes no sense. And because they are professionals, they don\u2019t say this publicly. Instead, it leaks out in another way: hesitation, a lack of intensity, and what looks like a silent protest from players on the pitch. Movements are half-hearted, decisions are delayed, and the collective energy feels flat. This isn\u2019t laziness. It\u2019s collective tiredness and frustration about their unnatural positions. This is understandable. Let's imagine that you are the best butcher in town but as a boss I want you to herd sheep and to be a shepherd. Do you think these two are the same thing? If you do, then we clearly don\u2019t share the same views on football.\n\nAt this point, it doesn\u2019t even require a revolution. Just for one or two matches, put everyone in their natural position and actually watch this team breathe. Watch the rhythm change. Watch confidence return.\n\nThe solution, at least as a starting point, is staring us in the face. With Vin\u00edcius suspended in the next match with Valencia and Jude was announced to be out for a month, Arbeloa has a perfect opportunity to finally try something logical:\n\nMove Mbapp\u00e9 to the left wing where he is most dangerous.\nStart Gonzalo as a true striker as 9. \nBegin with Rodrygo on the right wing.\nPlay Guler as a number ten.\nBuild the midfield with Tchouam\u00e9ni, Camavinga, and Valverde (when Jude returns write Jude here in midfield).\nLine up Carreas at left back, Trent at right back.\nUse Asencio and Huijsen in central defense.\n\nThe core problem at Real Madrid right now is not talent or quality. This squad that has grown tired and deeply tired of playing out of natural position and being unable to show its true potential. Until that changes, the quiet rebellion on the pitch from players will continue even though they try their best in their unnatural positions.\n\nSometimes, the bravest tactical decision is simply letting players be who they are and allow them to play in their natural positions which is the main reaaon why these players were transferred to Madrid.",

So what I am saying is yeah they are playing shit at the moment. It happens they came to a very imbalanced and ego centric team, our team is in a messed up condition, this is what happens when your team consists of less experienced players.\n\nAnyway I am guarantee you if we just kept faith in them for 1 more season, they will bounce back. I mean dean is just 20 years old, Raul is 22, Franco is 18 years old and they are playing in the biggest club in the world that pressure is immense, I bet no one in our community wouldn't dare to touch the ball with that kind of pressure. It takes time to adjust, what can they do.\n\nThey just witnessed a coach that promised them get sacked, I mean it is a big shoes to fill, I mean this is what happens when you sign players to the biggest club in the world with very little experience, jude and Mbappe are made in such a way that they could handle these pressure at the very young age. But not everyone is them.\n\nSo what I am saying is we can criticize them on match day's but stop promoting hate on them, it's very unnecessary.",

Everyone would have their opinion on the best XI but I think the Captaincy role would be less competitive.\n\nIf you want you could suggest the first, second and third captains too.\n\nMy pick would be Casillas or Ramos.

He completely let Rayo dominate in the midfield when he send Diaz in who has no clue how to play as an 8 and destroyed any chance of circulating the ball from the back or keeping possession against the press.\n\nThe Ceballos sub would have made so much sense. It's mind boggling to see such a tactically inept Madrid coach. Completely messed up the whole flow of the match.",
