        "content": "Hey everyone,after yesterday welcoming of Ancelotti and today's National Team Call up,i've started to think not only about How Ancelotti impacted Madrid on his career,but also How he impacted my life before i Knew anything about Football.One of the reasons why i feel in love with Football and Real Madrid was Kak\u00e1,around '09,i didn't knew what was Real Madrid,How Madrid player,i Just wanted to support them Because of Kak\u00e1. And that Goes for a lot of Brazillian kids fell in love with Football and Madrid,but at anypoint i Knew who Ancelotti was at that moment.  Then,It came the Seasons,the i learned more and more about Football and How much he impacted not only Kak\u00e1,but all the amazing players From my country that made me excited to watch the sele\u00e7\u00e3o games. Vini,Rodrygo, Endrick,Milit\u00e3o,Casemiro,Marcelo,Lucas Silva,Douglas Costa,Rafinha, Thiago Silva,David Luiz, Kak\u00e1,Pato,R9,Dinho,Cafu and the list goes on and on.  All those players,not only impacted me,but impacted and imensurable amount of kids that love the beautiful game. And seeing him today,Receiving the Zagallo jacket(For the contexto: Zagallo(RIP) not only won the World Cup as coach but also as player,he has 4 World cups under his belt,2 as player and 2 as coach) From Felip\u00e3o the coach From the penta after becoming the most victorious coach of our history,It made me emotional,not only because of the impact he made on my life,but coming full circle and knowing that my family and friends will get a to know This Amazing Man,not only for what he made for our country,but for now what he's going to do with my country.",

A day that I will have marked in my calendar for life.\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cI am very happy to be here, in what I feel is my home. My bond with Madridismo has never ceased to exist and, since I entered Valdebebas an hour and a half ago, that feeling has been reborn.\n\n&gt; \u201cI have the feeling that this is the beginning of a new era. Florentino, thank you very much for the confidence. I feel that the fans, the Madridistas, are excited to start this new era, to grow and to make the history of this club greater. Thanks also to my family, who are always with me\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cBefore I start talking about the new phase, I don\u2019t want to stop talking about the phase that has come to an end. Carlo was my coach, a great person and a great influence. Without his mastery, I would probably not be here. I take over and I take up his legacy with a lot of honour and a lot of pride. I hope I can live up to the expectations and take the club to all the places where we all believe we can do it.\n\n&gt; \u201cWe are starting a period in which I feel that the club and the fans are united. We have a great team, we have fantastic players and very good potential. That gives me reason to come here with a lot of energy and enthusiasm. We have the conviction that we can achieve important things, worthy of Real Madrid and these European Cups.\n\n&gt; \u201cWe want the fans to be proud, that we transmit emotions, joy. We want people to go to the stadium to enjoy themselves. If we manage to ignite that, we will have an unstoppable force. We are convinced that we can do great things, thank you very much.\n\n&gt; \u201cThank you very much, Hala Madrid!\u201d",

Sure there were small periods of time where we had a different coach (Ben\u00edtez,Solari, Lopetegui) but they never lasted longer than a few months, at most half a season.\n\nWhich is why I'm kinda nervous with Xabi, considering the 3 failed manager attempts mentioned earlier, but not too anxious considering hos backgrohnd. \n\nTldr; this might be the first manager besides Carlo-Zizou to finish a entire season with Madrid since 12/13, bringing an end to an era. Only Zizou could replace Carlo, and vice versa.",

The moment he was subbed out and everything stopped was crazy. The guard of honor for him and then the walk around the stadium. It was a very emotional experience, still don't believe he's done \ud83e\udd1e",

I hope he plays great for us and I hope he's appreciated by the Bernabeu faithful. \n\nHe would have Carvajal competing for RB position as well which would be interesting to see. \n\nALREADY LOVE TRENT \u2764\ufe0f",

        "content": "First of, I'd like to start by saying that, I'm not active here, like at all, so most of my observations come from 'Twitter', but nonetheless, here's what I have to say\n\nHonestly, there's a lot to process, a lot on my mind, a lot that I thought of saying, a lot that I wanted to say, some serious comments, other sarcastic remarks, but I always find myself avoiding posting these stuff because I feel like once I start writing I never stop, so, I'll try to just, say what I feel like needs to be said the most..\n\nNow that it's over, I would like to point out one thing\n\nIt's hilarious, and absurd, to me, that people actually believe Carlo is to blame for anything, or that he failed, or that this season was 'bad' because of him, or that he did no good, when in reality, he actually did more than he should.. Came to a broken team, came as a 'scapegoat', overachieved, brought us back to glory, scarified himself when he should have walked away like Zidane did, because he put the club above himself, never complained, never put the board under the bus, always presented himself professionally, and presented the club in the best way possible.. He is and always will be the ideal manager for everything that Real Madrid stands for, and the reason people slandered him, blamed him, or doubted him, is because they are simply in this for the glory and the 'bragging rights', they don't understand the club nor its values, they think they are entitled to glory every year but guess what, this era was an 'outlier', not the standard, and the reason it became a minimum expectation is BECAUSE of Carlo, not in spite of him.. But you will never realise that, not that it really matters anyway.. \n\nBut one thing is for sure, regardless of a few barks online, or a bandwagon that runs on agendas and clout chasing, Carlo leaves the club as the greatest manager in our history, and no amount of narrative twisting will ever change that.\n\nGracias Carlo, forever grateful..\n\nThe silver lining in all this? Another coach who represents everything we stand for is joining the club, one of my favourite players of all time.. I'm glad that, at least, if we're losing Carlo, we're getting Xabi, and honestly? it's hard not to get excited at the idea that he's going to be at the helm, even all things considered..\n\nPersonally, I think he's the first player, from those I actively watched, that I wanted to see as a coach one day, so I'm guessing, for me as a fan, it really is a new era.. full circle moment..\n\nHala Madrid, Y Nada Mas..",
