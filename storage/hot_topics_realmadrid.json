        "content": "Guler was quite good as AMC, he also could play DLP, but he was put into RW/Right Midfielder position and Jude in the left/middle, that doesn't help too much in defense. While he created chance.\n\nFede doesn't work as DM, he should switch position with Guler to play Right midfielder, that's his best position.\n\nJude had some good moment but obviously he hasn't recovered to his best form yet.\n\nAnd after the changes it's just total mess.",
