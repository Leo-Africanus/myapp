        "content": "#FT: JUVENIL A 2:0 DORTMUND\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#UEFA YOUTH LEAGUE \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:**\n\n1:0 Hugo de Llanos 44'\n\n2:0 Hugo de Llanos 64'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - kickoff, vamos! \n\n\u26bd 44' - GOLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - Fortea breaks through on the right wing and puts in a nice cross right in front of Dortmund's goal, where Hugo de Llanos times his run nicely and heads it into the corner for the lead! \n\nHT - We dominated possession throughout the entire first half, with Dortmund playing the same football as they already did in the league phase game, just sitting back and waiting for the unlikeliest of counter opportunities to arise - we struggled to create danger in the first half, which makes it all the more important that the first decent chance was converted into a goal\n\n46' - 2nd half underway\n\n\u26bd 64' - GOLLLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - Fortea plays in Jacobo, who lays it off to Pol Fortuny, he puts in a cross towards the far post, where once again, Hugo de Llanos appears with a header to squeeze it into the net from a tight angle! \n\n\ud83d\udd04 71' - keeper Javi Navarro can't continue after a late challenge by the Dortmund player earlier, \u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez replaces him\n\n\ud83d\udd04 78' - Lamini Fati and Cestero on for Roberto Mart\u00edn and de Llanos\n\n\ud83d\udd04 86' - last subs, Thiago Pitarch and Pol Rivera on for Jacobo Ortega and Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez \n\n90'+4 - massive double chance, first Fortea's shot is saved by the keeper, than Cristian's is blocked by a defender \n\nFT - like in the league phase game, Real Madrid was dominant and superior to Dortmund's U19s, but this time also with a fair and just result - the team controlled possession throughout the match, was efficient when it mattered, and had no trouble defending against Dortmund's efforts. The win means that Arbeloa's team has reached the round of 16, where the opponent is yet to be determined in a draw\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 16:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee:** Joey Booij (NED) \n\n**Competition:** UEFA Youth League, Round of 32, Single-leg \n\n**Viewing options:** [RMTV/RM Play (potentially VPN needed)](https://www.realmadrid.com/real-madrid-tv), [UEFA.TV](https://uefa.tv) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Juvenil A XI (4-3-3):** \nJavi Navarro (71' \u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez) - V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as \u2018Valde\u2019, Diego Aguado, Mario Rivas, Jes\u00fas Fortea - Cristian David, Roberto Mart\u00edn (78' Lamini Fati) - Hugo de Llanos (78' Jorge Cestero), Pol Fortuny, Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (86' Pol Rivera) - Jacobo Ortega (86' Thiago Pitarch) \n\nBench: Melvin Ukpeigbe, Izan Regueira, Aimar Santiago, Jaime Barroso.\n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n**UYL League Phase stats:** 6th | 12pt | 4-0-2 | 10:5\n",

Averaged a goal contribution every 48 minutes. That's even better than Messi in 2011/12, when he averaged a goal contribution every 50 minutes. It's funny that both of them didn't win the title in their best season ever.",

        "content": "Can we talk about how well vinicius controlled his emotions last night ?? The big problem with vini was always letting the fans and players get into his head especially in away games but last night vinicius wss flawless man he had a whole stadium putting up a banner about him , the whole stadium booing him but not even once did i see vinicius complaining about anything..this is what real madrid fans want from him just play football and eventually he'll get his award which is the ballon dor..i love how he was not affected by the crowd and the booing truly hopefully that continues in spain/la liga too ..vinicius seems to be learning from cr7 alot he also revealed that he talks to him alot last night ..hopefully ronaldo is advising and mentoring him.",
