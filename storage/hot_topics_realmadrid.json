        "content": "This season hurts because it feels like we could have done more. It did not end the way we dreamed, but when I look back at these years under Carlo, all I feel is gratitude.\nWe lived so many unforgettable moments together. The comebacks against PSG, Chelsea, City. Nights where it felt impossible but somehow we believed, and somehow we made it happen. The Champions League, the Super Cups, the League titles. All the happiness, all the emotions, we owe a lot of it to him.\nEven when things were bad, Carlo gave us calm. He never disrespected the club, never created drama, never lost his class. He always carried himself with dignity and love for this badge.\nNot every season can end with a trophy, but it is the memories and the journey that stay forever.\nIt hurts to say goodbye but he deserves this next chapter with Brazil.\nThank you Mister for everything you gave us. For the victories, for the faith, for the moments.\nYou will always have a place at Real Madrid. You will always be one of us.\n\n\u00a1Hala Madrid y nada m\u00e1s!\n",

He still makes things happen. Whether it\u2019s beating a defender and sending a cross in, shots on target, hell, even a G/A. He makes things happen and his presence is always felt.\n\nTo put things in perspective, Mbapp\u00e9, in his DEBUT season, is only 10 goals away from equaling Rodrygo\u2019s total LaLiga goal count. That is just crazy to me. I\u2019d like to know everyone\u2019s thoughts here. Am I rushing to conclusions and being reactionary? Or is this truly a player that is just not at the level of a  Real Madrid starter?",

        "content": "Fran Garcia has been a spark on the left all season, taking the ball into attack more than almost more than Vasquez, opening up defenses with astute dribbles and passes, and holding firm when it counts with crucial tackles, interceptions, and blocks. Mendy, on the other hand, has struggled one setback after another and hardly clocked the minutes required to reach top gear, leaving us short on that attacking push. Add in that Fran is easily one of the fastest players in our squad\u2014able to burn past wingers and still sprint back into position\u2014and you\u2019ve got a full-back who blends flair with defensive grit. He\u2019s built real understanding with our center-backs and midfield, while Mendy\u2019s stop-start season has kept him on the back foot. If you desire a left-back who's fit, in form, and can switch defense to attack in the blink of an eye, I do think Fran Garcia clears Ferland Mendy.\n\n",

Tactically naturally we are a bit lost, so that's a huge task in and off itself, but after the classico display ito player behavior (that being the flashpoint, but many individual incidents prior) will he be able to get the buy in needed.\n\nLike ZZ he is a legendary ex-player, so that should buy him latitude, but I worry if the squad will be receptive. Naturally Flo will play a significant role by supporting the manager and putting faith in him but from those of you that watch more Leverkusen than me, and especially those that have followed the clubhouse news, what information is there on Xabi's man management?\n\nAt the very least he needs to be able to get buyin from the forwards to track back and be more involved in the buildup play, which Carlo has struggled to do outside the biggest games. This is for me a huge cultural issue as much as tactical. Getting that buy in will be critical.\n\nAnyway just a pretty open ended question to see what you guys think about our path forward? Even if it's just to say we don't need cultural corrections... \n\n",

        "content": "This isn't a post defending Rodrygo. I'm just bringing up his case as a perfect example of how lot of fans dramatically change their mind within the span of few weeks, sometimes just one week.\n\nRight after we lost the against Arsenal in El Bernabeu, Marca asked people to  \nvote which players should leave this summer. I'll paste here the most relevant part and I'll provide the link for those who want to read it:\n\n\\&gt;The question was simple, but forceful (Which players should leave in the summer?)... and the answer couldn't have been more direct  \n\\[.......\\]  \n**&gt;Jes\u00fas Vallejo** received 12% of the votes \\[...\\] He narrowly surpassed (11%) **Lucas V\u00e1zquez**, \\[...\\] The list of culprits is long and sharp. **Alaba followed closely (10%), then Ancelotti and Mendy (9%)... before surprisingly reaching Vinicius (63,000 votes).**  \n\\[.......\\]  \n**&gt;As things stand, Courtois gets the best grade of all (7.16) and Vallejo the worst (3.19). In total, 14 players passed (Courtois, Valverde, Asensio, Bellingham, R\u00fcdiger, Brahim, Ceballos, Lunin, Modric, Mbapp\u00e9, Carvajal, Endrick, Rodrygo, and Camavinga) and 10 failed (the rest of the squad and Ancelotti).**\n\n  \nLink: [https://www.marca.com/futbol/real-madrid/2025/04/18/aficion-mira-palco-exige-dos-fichajes-venderia-vinicius-verano.html](https://www.marca.com/futbol/real-madrid/2025/04/18/aficion-mira-palco-exige-dos-fichajes-venderia-vinicius-verano.html)\n\nThat was only 1 week ago. The votes were pretty much in line with what many people was saying on this sub after that game.\n\nThose with good memory should remember how for most part of the season how many people used to name Tchouameni as a player who should be sold, and Vinicius (best of the world last season according to most fans) was very often mentioned as a player an attacker that should be sold.\n\nRodrygo or Mbappe were barely mentioned if someone asked if any of our attackers should leave.\n\nFast forward two weeks and nobody thinks Tchouameni should leave, almost nobody mentions Viniciuys should leave but lot of people think Rodrygo should.\n\nNow some will claim that they never asked for Vinicius to be sold but they always asked Rodrygo to be sold. Well, maybe you in particular didn't but the facts are there. If are one of those who claims this or the other certified great player should be sold then I don't believe you, and if you think Rodrygo isn't a great player (despite his performance this season) then I'm sorry but I gotta laugh at how little you understand this team sport.",

        "content": "I know everyone is angry right now and honestly, that\u2019s the only right response. But we\u2019ve been here before. A few years ago, we were losing 4-0 to Barcelona and getting knocked out by teams like Ajax. Yet even then, at our lowest, we found a way to rebuild and come back stronger. Even at our worst, we won trophies because we adapted and evolved.\n\nThere\u2019s no point in commenting on other teams; what matters is that we, collectively, need to evolve again. Football has changed. Players today are so used to individual attention that they struggle to share the spotlight. But remember when we had Ronaldo, no one could have imagined anyone else from our team winning a Ballon d\u2019Or. Yet we produced not just one, but two different Ballon d\u2019Or winners after him. It\u2019s not about individual awards they never mattered much to me it\u2019s about what they represented: the strength of the team. Our trophy cabinet didn\u2019t grow because of individual brilliance alone; it grew because we played for each other.\n\nFootball has evolved, and the people who need to understand that the most are the ones managing the club the board and the decision makers.\n\nThe part that hurts the most when I watch our matches today is this, the soul of the team I once supported feels lost. There\u2019s no passion, no mentality just wannabe Instagram stars and crybabies. Players lose the ball and stay down waiting for a foul instead of fighting to win it back. That\u2019s not the Real Madrid way.\n\nWe need leadership someone who can bring these kids back in line, or, frankly, some people need to leave.\n\nRegardless, I\u2019ll always support the badge. But this? This is not the level, nor the spirit, of Real Madrid.\n\nWe will bounce back, that\u2019s for sure. \n\nHala Madrid!! ",
