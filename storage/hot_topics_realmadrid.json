        "content": "Let me start by saying that Ancelotti is responsible of what is going on, as a coach. He is NOT innocent and deserves all criticism, as things barely improved since the beginning of the season.\n\nIt's fine if you're a supporter and you want change because you see things are not working for your team. Nothing wrong with being mad at your team losing like this in the favorite competition.\n\nWith that being said, the brain dead takes of 'Bring in Raul/Zidane/X for the second leg and the rest of the season' is just un-fucking-believable. This is not Lopetegui or Rafael Benitez. This is Carlo Ancelotti, the coach with the most titles and who won us 3 UCLs ! Doesn't he deserve to finish the season ? If he doesn't, who does ? And you all counter Bar\u00e7a posts about Real Madrid disrespecting their legends !!!\n\nAnd none of these motherfuckers watched a game managed by Raul in Castilla. It was the same cries last year and the year before and the year before, since Carlo took charge. Don't tell me this is because of his performance this season.. even when he performed, I still see the shit he takes, and people wanted Tuchel to replace him back in the day !\n\nWe have lots of problems, including players mentality and squad depth and injury crisis. But y'all love summing everything into 'Carlo is garbage fuck off bring in Xabi/Klopp/Zizou'...  because you want results right away and can't take a loss and want a scapegoat and an easy roast. You think managing an institute and a club like Real Madrid by switching legend coaches with 10 matches or 15 matches left in the season is the way to go...\n\nI will not change reality with this, as I believe those stupid cunts exist in every 'popular' club. I remember Bar\u00e7a fans posting a 'Hansi Flick is not right for us' upvoted post when Benefica was winning against them in that 5-4 remontada. This is where a club like freaking Atletico Madrid is even more respectful towards Simeone... and even Man City out there, who is supposed to have 'glory hunters' is defending Guardiola despite the shit performance.\n\nI ain't asking to defend Ancelotti. Ancelotti is NOT a failure of a coach, but now he is failing. We won, made crazy come backs, celebrated UCL wins like nothing under this coach... the least I can do is NOT disrespect him and let him have what it looks like it's his final season and even if my brain doesn't believe in a come back, my heart does. He has given a lot.\n\nI'm no Ancelotti nut eater, I'm a man who has been watching Real Madrid since 2011 and lived his most joyful moments under Ancelotti and during our worst moments, I understand the old man is human and prone to mistakes and not just some idiot sitting in his room playing FIFA and thinking of players as PS5 bots and acting like they understand 'tactics', like a lot of people.\n\nNothing wrong with 'We need a new coach' and 'Ancelotti did a lot but his time is up'... but seriously any 'Ancelotti has been a lucky bastard carried by individual brilliance' or 'Ancelotti is stupid, bring in Raul or Zizou' for the second leg, GTFO",

        "title": "Our players are gassed",
        "content": "I think the distances covered in this game might be one of the best stats to show our season in a nutshell.\n\nTop 4 performers from Arsenal and 1km less on average. Our players are spent.\n\nIt has been discussed plenty of times how unlucky we are with injuries. 2 regular starters missing from the defence (Dani and Eder) and most midfielders struggled with at least one significant injury (min. 1 month) throughout the season.\n\nIt has also been mentioned how our squad has caveats. No backup RB. 2 CBs at the start of the season (Rudi is 1 and Eder and Alaba I count as half each since they had major injuries). We got lucky with Asencio, his integration was not a result of precise planning but rather necessity. No proper alternate FW.\n\nThen the misallocation of minutes. Obviously we don\u2019t see how the players work in trainings so let\u2019s trust Carlo\u2019s and his team\u2019s judgment on the players performance and deserved minutes. But I cannot fathom that for them the only two options for the fringe players are less than 5 mins or 90 mins every 1,5 months. There were several games where some of them could have started. There were other games where they could have been substituted earlier.\n\nAnd now Jude and Fede are running on their last reserves. Rudiger is a colossus but I think even he might start to feel fatigued and some cracks start to show up in his performance. Asencio is great but not experienced enough. Tchoumani is our best player right now. Luka is unfortunately not fit anymore to deliver every 3 days. Camavinga for one 8+ performance has 2 underwhelming ones. Vini-problem no need to be elaborated anymore.\n\nI\u2019m being too pessimistic and just had to vent a little?",

Mbappe basically was an obsession for Perez &amp; he was a financial signing. Madrid needed a real striker for these big games.\n\nConceded 9 against Barca, 3 vs Milan, 4 vs Sociedad, now 3 vs Arsenal. This is a shit team with no chemistry with a manager who has no idea on strategy &amp; tactics, who wins mostly because of his player's individual brilliance. I hate barca but I love the way Hansi Flick plays and he is winning with a bunch of kids from the academy.\n\nMidfield control &amp; defensive stability is needed but I know Perez will probably bring in another attacker like Wirtz or Gy\u00f6keres. F*ck the defense I think.\n\nAncelotti is done. He should f*ck off right now. Get KLOPP ,he is the best available.",

        "content": "First of all, we deserved to lose. Last whole month we are playing horrible. And even if we win against Arsenal in 2nd leg we won't win CL playing like this. There are too many things going on. I like Madrid doesn't buy players just to fill the spot but defensively we weren't good last year so why there are no signing that's beyond me. I won't go into all that. I just want to say, if you love football you know it's not easy to win every game. As RM we won CL like it's nothing. In a way we are spoiled. \nWe should give credit to other teams. RM always comes back. This year may not be good for us but we will be back. I believe in the club. So my humble request to the Real fans will be support the team no matter the result. Win / lose. \nI love being RM fan nothing can ever change that. Bad times will pass and glory days are ahead. ",

        "content": "Today, Madrid just didn\u2019t feel like Madrid at any point. I was definitely worried going into this match  far from home, playing on Arsenal\u2019s surface, with their fans behind them, our struggling defense, no Tchouameni in midfield, and Alaba forced to play LB. To be fair, Alaba did well today, but I was absolutely not expecting a 3-0 loss. I was expecting more from our attack  they looked clueless for most of the game apart from some flashes in the first half.\n\nMbappe showed glimpses, Vini tried, Rodrygo too  the first half was going decently well. But after that absolute banger from Declan Rice in the second half, it felt like we just gave up. We were crumbling all over the pitch  clearing the ball aimlessly. For the first time in a long time, I genuinely saw real urgency and frustration written all over our players. The energy shifted completely.\n\nAnd after that second Rice free-kick, it really felt like it was done. That was the killer blow. It felt like Arsenal just finished us right there.\n\nI know we still have a second leg back home. And we are Real Madrid  the club where dreams happen, where magical things have always been possible. But are we still that Madrid this season? That\u2019s the real question weighing on my mind.\n\nCan we overcome this? With Lucas and Alaba as our main full-backs, I\u2019m genuinely worried. But at the same time, I\u2019m still hopeful  because it\u2019s the Bernab\u00e9u, and this is Real Madrid. Hopefully, we\u2019ll see a comeback for the ages.\n\nBut if I\u2019m being realistic, things aren\u2019t looking good right now. And with Bar\u00e7a coming up on the 26th too\u2026 this stretch of games is going to test us like never before.\n\nHala Madrid\u2026 always.\n\n",

        "content": "I have been watching Real Madrid all season. There's so much torture to defend as a team and be compact, no effort up front. It's a torture to watch this team. Absolute torture. Can we be honest with ourselves for once? We have been supporting but it's time to let the rant loose. I knew Arsenal would beat Madrid. I was so so convinced, that's how much I have lost confidence in this team. I just expected coping words at the end of the match and that's what happened.\n\nI don't want to blame Mbappe but the man literally does no defending up front but that's a separate issue. Before the Arsenal game, I genuinely thought that we would get destroyed after watching the shenanigans against Valencia. I just cannot believe that a team as stacked as this cannot utilize it's full dynamic strength.\n\nLet me give you an example. At the end of the first half, or close to the end, Valverde had an opportunity to cross into the box but didn't. He instead passed to Camavinga who skied the ball. Any team would have crossed that ball, but this team didn't, Jude especially was frustrated. I saw it. This is another example that this team doesn't use any of its strength, or refuses to engage it. Imagine having 6 players in the box waiting for a cross and then you pass to Camavinga. There is no desire to want to use any energy on aerial attacks, it's all one dimensional style. This team is so predictable that it's not even funny. That's why they're so easy to defend against. Oh, if you send a back pass to center of the box area once you get to the final third from the wing, you're guaranteed to get a shot. Valencia and Sociedad exploited this. Arsenal's goal came this way as well. Is anyone surprised? Please.\n\nOur front forwards do not challenge for the ball in the air at all apart from Jude, if you pay attention, all they try and do is pretend that they are going for the ball then pull out of the challenge hoping that the other team's player somehow leaves it for them. There's no fight. Courtois crosses ball, opponents defenders get the ball. It's a cycle. The cycle is get a ball, pass it to the wing, the winger cuts inside and passes it eventually back to the midfield and the cycle repeats itself. If Vini does not run past defenders to make a final pass or Jude pull out one magical through pass then we struggle to score.\n\nIs anyone surprised by this result? Be honest. Or are you actually happy that we might be going out? that way we can finally get rid of the terrorist football we're playing. If Taliban sponsored a football team that was this talented, this is how they would play, like brainless chickens who don;t know what to do. This team is too good to be going out against Arsenal.\n\nAnd no, it's not just football that Declan Rice had an opportunity to score those two goals. It's poor planning, poor instructions and poor management. Conceding stupid chances outside of the box against a team known to be aerially very good with set piece. I mean my goodness, Rodrygo was in the box with Arsenal players where Arsenal playes moved, he should be where Mbappe was standing, he's shorter than Mbappe. Mbappe was doing NOTHING except watch the ball go in. What did he need to be there for? Against valencia, yes I understand but against a team that just score a freekick goal against you? WHAT? I saw him standing there and I said, they'll probably score a second one. He's standing there not doing NOTHING except watching. This team's management is absolutely STUPID and need to be fired at the end of the season.\n\nI look forward to the second leg counter attacks and comedy. I'm happy this happened, this bandage needed to come off, this team's Manager is clueless.\n\nEnd of Rant. I'm happy this happened. I'm a Real Madrid fan but I do not support mediocrity from this team's management. This team is controlled by LAZY, CLUELESS and POOR management.",

Only problem was that Arsenal bottled the midfield and made Rodrygo\u2019s width irrelevant. And when we managed to get it wide, Skelly had plenty of time to catch up. We essentially played down a man due to Ancelotti\u2019s tactical approach. 3 men down if you include Mbappe and Vini\u2019s non-existent press.\n\n[Tactical Analysis](https://youtu.be/edZESO6HSeg?si=kGvGfsHsJ2eMBE_C)",

        "content": "This season is NOT our season. I was sooooo soooo excited and hopeful when Mbappe joined Madrid. But at the same time I was skeptical because this feels too good to be true \u2014 Jude + Vini + Rodrygo and now Mbappe. And sure enough we struggled because of sooooo many reasons (injuries + no Kroos &amp; Nacho replacements + no tactics + no hunger/drive/passion/etc). \n\nFrom the get go, this season felt off! \n\nSometimes I wonder, is it because the squad has won way too many UCLs already or La Ligas that they are not as motivated? Or is it just because Ancelotti\u2019s tactics no longer work/he does not know what to do with the team now? Or the players are just bad (or in a slump)?\n\nI know, we cannot win every single time! But if I\u2019m being honest, I did want the team to win the treble this year \u2014 just to prove a point especially now that we (finally) have Mbappe. \n\nBUT\u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s happening this year. Sadly \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI just hope the team will finish the season strong \u2014 UCL QFs 2nd leg + remaining La Liga games + CDR.\n\nAnd hopefully, HOPEFULLY\u2026 we find solutions to our problems ASAP! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc I\u2019m sure Real Madrid will come back strong \u2014 they\u2019ve been through this before! And they have proven time and time again that they can recover.\n\nI just want to extend grace to the entire team coz if it\u2019s hard for us, it must be harder for them. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc94\n\nSo, as early as now\u2026 I\u2019m already conceding \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f. I\u2019d rather be realistic (and pessimistic) rather than setting myself up for disappointment and be heartbroken. There\u2019s nothing wrong with losing anyways, that\u2019s part of life\u2026 just as long as you don\u2019t stay a loser and that you actually strive to be better\n\n\u00a1HALA MADRID y nada mas!",

        "content": "Fellow madridistas, yesterday's defeat was painful. Particularly because of the manner of the defeat where we didn't see any positives or promising signs that the team can turn it around in the return leg.\n\nBut what I would like to point out is that while Ancelotti's tactics were incomprehensible for me, we should not put the sole blame on him.\n\nAn example: In the summer we lost Joselu &amp; Alvaro rodriguez while bringing in Mbappe &amp; Endrick. \n\nI think we can all agree that on paper, it doesn't seem like a net loss does it?\nMbappe is a much more valuable asset than Joselu, and he is easily the superior player.\nHowever, when you're planning a squad you need to take into account what the COLLECTIVE can offer and not just the individual player. \n\nWhen it comes to the qualities of our front three, losing Joselu (and benzema the previous summer) meant we've lost some important roles that none of the existing front three can match: hold up play, poaching and aerial threats. They also did something important which is disrupting the build up play of the opponent and harassing their defense.\n\nThis is why Endrick has looked good in most matches he's played (7 goals in under 600 minutes played so a goal/85 minutes), he addresses areas of weakness in our regular front three (mainly poaching, disrupting build up play) even if he doesn't really match what benzema and joselu could provide there.\n\nSomething similar happened in defense, Carvajal's injury wasn't predictable but this is why Nacho was so valuable to the squad. Having someone who was comfortable in defense (may not have been good going forward) in at least two spots meant we weren't going to suffer this badly seeing Vazquez consistently dribbled past or losing valverde's midfield efforts. It also meant that you could've afforded to play rudiger/asencio fewer games and had them in better condition heading into the last month of the season.\n\nI do not know if ancelotti has any say on the squad planning. But whoever has the say should've done better.",
