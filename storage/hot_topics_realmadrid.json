        "content": "#FT: WOLVES 0:1 CASTILLA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#PREMIER LEAGUE INTERNATIONAL CUP\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:** \n\n0:1 Bruno Iglesias 84'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - kickoff, vamos! \n\n33' - after an even start to the game, Wolves are now pushing - first a header hits our crossbar after Mestre misjudges the trajectory of a corner, then Mestre is forced to a save on another shot \n\n42' - Wolves' Holman loses the plot and goes after Aguado on the floor for no reason, giving him some sort of push - our players react and a scuffle emerges - the referee gives a Wolves player and Valdepe\u00f1as yellows, seemingly not for Holman though \n\n45'+4 - best chance for our boys after a nice combination on the right side - the ball gets laid off to Manu \u00c1ngel at the edge of the box, and his left-footed shot goes just wide of the near post \n\nHT - half time in a relatively uneventful match, mostly even for the most part, but with Wolves creating more danger so far - Castilla are struggling in the build-up against their pressure and physicality\n\n54' - Castilla come out of the locker rooms much better, pushing hard for the lead - Bruno Iglesias forces the keeper to a great save with a low shot from the edge of the box \n\n56' - great combination now by Roberto Mart\u00edn and Pol, whose through ball is perfect for Jacobo, but his lob from a tight angle goes over the bar\n\n58' - penalty not given for a foul on Pol Fortuny in the box, he was clearly tripped \n\n\ud83d\udd04 61' - triple sub by Arbeloa: Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, Pol Dur\u00e1n and Jorge Cestero come on for Jacobo Ortega, Manuel \u00c1ngel and Cristian David - like for like substitutions\n\n\ud83d\udd04 67' - two more subs - Valdepe\u00f1as off for Joan, Roberto Mart\u00edn off for Gabri Castrelo\n\n81' - great one two by Pol Dur\u00e1n and Gabri Castrelo, Pol Dur\u00e1n is through in the box, but the keeper saves - Castilla are very close to scoring a winner here\n\n\u26bd 84' - GOLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - great free kick position, Bruno Iglesias steps up, lifts it over the wall and curls it nicely into the corner! \n\n90'+5 - one final chance for Wolves after this weird referee lets a clear foul go in our half, Wolves have a 5v3, Mestre storms out of his goal and forces an early shot, which goes far wide\n\nFT - very deserved win in Castilla's debut in the Premier League International Cup after a very dominant second half. Arbeloa managed to set up the buildup and the press in a way that gave Castilla control and took Wolves' attackers out of the game - the team created and missed opportunities in open play, but in the end Bruno Iglesias' free kick golazo still gave them the deserved win\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 20:00 CEST\n\n**Venue:** Molineux Stadium, Wolverhampton\n\n**Referee**: Jacob Viera\n\n**Competition:** U21 Premier League International Cup, Group Stage\n\n**Viewing options:** [RM Play](https://play.realmadrid.com/live/237284), [RMTV](https://www.realmadrid.com/es-ES/real-madrid-tv)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-3-3): Sergio Mestre - V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as (67' Joan Mart\u00ednez), Manu Serrano, Diego Aguado, David Jim\u00e9nez - Cristian David (61' Jorge Cestero), Roberto Mart\u00edn (67' Gabri Castrelo), Manuel \u00c1ngel (61' Pol Dur\u00e1n) - Bruno Iglesias, Jacobo Ortega (62' Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga), Pol Fortuny\n\nBench: Guille S\u00fanico (GK), Lamini Fati.\n\nUnavailable: Fran Gonz\u00e1lez (Spain U21 call-up), Mario Rivas (injury), Jes\u00fas Fortea (Spain U19 call-up), C\u00e9sar Palacios (injury), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (Spain U19 call-up), Rachad Fettal (injury). \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** W\n\n**PL International Cup stats:** - | 0pt | 0-0-0 | 0:0\n\n",

        "title": "Mbapp\u00e9 \"I like to say that fans are lucky to just come and enjoy a show without knowing what happens behind the scenes. Honestly, if I didn't have this passion, the world of football would have disgusted me a long time ago. I would never advise my child to step foot in the football world.\"",
        "content": "On the rape allegations last year\n\n\"I wasn't even concerned. It was just sad to see everyone jumping on it like it was a steak, on such a serious subject. It happens to far too many women, unfortunately, for us to jump on it for headlines and articles. No one took the time to ask what happened to the potential victim. And when everyone saw that I wasn't in this story, what happened? She's in the gutter, no one knows where she is, we don't care. It's a sensitive subject and it made me sad. I knew I was going to get back up because I wasn't involved, the police never called me, my name was never mentioned.\"\n\n\"I knew from the start that it would be okay, but it's complicated. Especially for those close to you, even more so for women. Whether you like it or not, you feel that in the other person's eyes, the person is thinking: 'What if there was a 1% chance that he did something?' It hurt me. I have nothing to do with it... These are human reactions from the women around me, because there are too many who go through this. I just had to accept it, keep quiet, go to training. Sometimes you see comments... But you accept it. Carlo (Ancelotti) told me it was unfair. I said to him: 'What should I do other than let it go and score goals?'\"\n\nOn the legal dispute with PSG\n\n\"It's my responsibility by right, it's labor law. The procedure gave the impression that I wanted to harm PSG. I signed an employment contract. I just wanted to be paid. I have nothing against PSG, I love this club, I have friends there. But it's the only way to get what I'm owed, something I've earned with my sweat. Whether you like it or not, it's still a job. But I already knew I wasn't getting paid when I was at PSG. When the money doesn't come in, you see it. I could have caused a scandal while I was there, but I told myself it wasn't worth it. But when you see that you're not being paid, after a while, you have to react. Only you quickly come across as the ex who's angry... If it could have been settled in an office, this story would never have existed.\"\n\nOn Cristiano Ronaldo's quote that he could only trust four people with his eyes closed\n\n\"I understand. 'Why is he telling me that? What does he want from me? What does he expect from me?' There are a lot of 'whys'. The line between being careful and being paranoid is very thin. You can come across as crazy. How many times have I heard people talk about a player and say: 'He's crazy!' No, he's paranoid because there are only crazy people around him. Maybe he met a beautiful person there, but he's just had 20 meetings with crazy people, so he has doubts, and that's normal.\"\n\nOn the mental exhaustion for players\n\n\"The complexity of the thing is that people have trouble with it. You must not show it. Someone in his living room would say, 'Fuck, at the price they're paying you, I'd be happy every day!' That's why sometimes it's better to keep it to yourself. If I win the World Cup, you come to me three days later and ask me about it, I can say it. You're practically untouchable there. You lose a match, you say that, they tell you that you're saying that because you were terrible. It doesn't change anything if I was already like that before the match... It's all a question of timing.\"",

(I'd go alone.) If tickets are available, what would the approximate price be?\n\n  \nAny advice you could give me would be more than grateful.",

My son is a die hard Real Madrid fan since birth \ud83d\ude05 his birthday is coming soon and i want to gift him an experience he will never forget rather than material things. I am a casual football fan but lately finding myself watching RMA matches with my son and we enjoy it. I am looking to take him to October 4 match against Villareal. So my question is, is this a big match? The reason i am asking this because i logged into Entradas.com and i can still find very good seats with reasonable price for UCL match against Olympique de Marseille. Is there a big chance that tickets would be still available 1 week before the VillaReal match? I was looking for tickets via 3rd party sites and they cost double for worse seats. Anyone who is experienced watching RMA live at Bernabeu? Thank you so much in advance!\n\nEdit: i would love to bring him to el classico but our vacation from work start on October 1. Would it be easier to get tickets for Villareal match contra UCL matches?",
