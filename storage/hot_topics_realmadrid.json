If you literally watch any of my videos on goals breakdown. You will notice how many times that same scenario with Vazquez has happened.",

        "content": "So you guys want Ancelotti to start some wood sticks so he can convince that he is doing something as a coach ? What the hell is wrong with this logic ?\n\nSo Lamine Yamal gets past 4 or 5 players and makes a brilliant assist and Flick is the best coach ever. Prime Bar\u00e7a was winning thanks to Messi dribbling 6 defenders and an Iniesta magical lob pass and Guardiola is the GOAT. But if Valverde scores from a kilometer, or Bellingham scores a last minute winner, or Vinicius or Mbapp\u00e9 score a brillant goal thanks to their speed, then it means that we are a weak team tactically and individual skills are saving Carlo and he is ass ?\n\nThis is fucking Real Madrid ! Of course there will be top players with great individual skills ! Same as Man City, same as Bayern Munich, same as Bar\u00e7a. Do you want fucking walking sticks or a mix of Getafe/Las Palmas/Deportivo Alaves players to start and Ancelotti to win the UCL and la liga and the cup with them so you guys say 'He is a good coach ?' Look at PSG, did it look like a weak ass squad ? \n\nWatch Barcelona getting manhandled by teams who have an ACTUAL RB and actual CB if you know what I mean, but Flick is still a better coach than Ancelotti I guess.\n\nThis is stupid. Last MBAPP\u00c9 goal against Celta Vigo I saw comments getting upvoted like 'and here we are winning again thanks to players individual skills, Carlo doesn't do shit'... so let me get this straight, on a counter attack, we have Mbapp\u00e9 and Vinicius Junior... I say let's slow down the attack, let Celta Vigo players return to defense and play some one twos and tiki taka until we reach the goal, and in that moment, maybe, just maybe, Ancelotti will become a better coach.\n\nSome 1000 game IQ so many here have....",
