All of us would be more frustrated and less forgiving with his behavior. \n\nAlso now some opponents will purposefully try to rile him up as they know it is easy to get reaction out of him. not to say they are not doing it currently.\n\n  \nAs fans we need to held him accountable that might give him necessary incentive to change\n\nHe can show dissent but he has to do it following the rules. He can't go on tantrum run. He to has to follow appropriate channels.",

It is going to be in the Bernabeu stadium, so that is a plus. Since this is at the end of our trip, I dont know if I'll have enough money left to buy tickets for all 3 of us, so he will probably he going alone.  \nAlso, I got him the Madridista card as you suggested, thank you for that idea! Is this match a very popular one or is it sort of safe to assume I'll be able to get a ticket if I keep checking the site?  \nThanks! I really feel like this community is helping to make this happen!  \n ",
