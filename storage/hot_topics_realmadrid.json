        "title": "Spanish Journalists and Anti madridistas hates the club world cup",
        "content": "Hey guys, today I\u2019ve got a question for you:\nWhat\u2019s your opinion on the Club World Cup?\nDo you think it\u2019s an important tournament, or is it just something minor that doesn\u2019t really matter?\n\nHonestly, for me\u2014at least for now\u2014I still think the Champions League is the most important competition of the season. I\u2019m just used to seeing the biggest tournaments as the ones with the best European teams.\n\nMaybe the Club World Cup doesn\u2019t feel that big to me because there are a lot of teams I\u2019ve never heard of. But let\u2019s be fair\u2014these teams are supposed to be the best from their respective confederations, so they earned their spot in the tournament.\n\nSo why am I even making this question?\n\nWell, over the past few days, I\u2019ve seen a lot of Spanish journalists\u2014yeah, actual journalists from the biggest media outlets in Spain\u2014mocking and belittling the Club World Cup\u2026 just because Barcelona isn\u2019t in it.\n\nThese people try to act like they\u2019re neutral, but if you follow their careers, it\u2019s obvious their favorite club\u2014or at least the one paying them\u2014is Barcelona.\nThey\u2019re saying things like:\n\u201cThe Club World Cup is less important than the Copa del Rey,\u201d\n\u201cHow can a serious tournament include Seattle Sounders?\u201d\n\u201cThree champions from the top leagues aren\u2019t even going,\u201d\nand \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if Liverpool and Barcelona aren\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nThey even say that Madrid fans only care about this tournament because it\u2019s the only thing Madrid can win this season\u2014which is just not true. Since the beginning of the season, the club has made it clear that they want to be the first team to win this new version of the tournament.\nThat\u2019s just how it is with Madrid\u2014when there\u2019s a trophy to win, the goal is to go for it. Always.\n\nAnd the thing is, these are the same journalists who\u2019ve been shaping football narratives in Spain for over 20 years. So it\u2019s really no surprise there\u2019s so much hate toward Real Madrid in the country.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget\u2014Barcelona is currently in the middle of a legal case where it was proven they paid journalists to speak positively about the club and its president, and negatively about others, including Messi. If you want to know more, just search \u201cBar\u00e7aGate\u201d on Google.\n\nAnd when it comes to the Negreira case, many of these journalists have never even brought it up on their own. When they\u2019re forced to talk about it, they say stuff like, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d but then go on to say, \u201cBarcelona never won because of the referees.\u201d\nMeanwhile, they make videos asking how it\u2019s possible that Madrid hasn\u2019t won back-to-back league titles in nearly 20 years.\nHonestly, Spanish football journalism is just embarrassing.\n\nAnyway, I really want to hear what you guys think.\nIs the Club World Cup something important to you? Or not really?\n\n",

He\u2019s selfless and has scored some really meaningful goals for us, he should stay 100%",
