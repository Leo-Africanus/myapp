        "content": "Every other day, I see our fanbase saying something harsh about Carlo and it breaks my heart. I understand some people never liked the brand of football he offered and last season in particular. I hear you guys. But acting like he was good for nothing and a big problem is such a harsh way to see him.\n\nBut let\u2019s be fair to him please.. On his first stint, he cane to Madrid from PSG when we weren\u2019t at our best. We had won one league title in 5 years and it seemed like we were never gonna win La Decima. He was the manager to finally deliver the league title to PSG and had unlimited money to push for CL there. He came over and he delivered the biggest night in the club history this century. And the reward he got- unfairly dackedyfor Rafa freaking Benitez next season. All the players publicly said they wanted him to stay.. Did he ever say anything bad about us? Nope, he said he is a Madridista just like us.\n\n2022- Zidane had just quit. Real Madrid were struggling to find a manager. Even Max Allegri snubbed us having said yes before. Who comes to the rescue? Carlo Ancelotti. And what does he do? Win us the Champions League against all odds and the league title too. Remember how far away we seemed from the CL title in 2021? And he does it again the best GK in the world, 2 starting CBs out with ACL and no striker other than Joselu..\n\nYes he had bad moments and difficult times.. Is some of his criticism fair? Yes, absolutely.. Does he deserve the abuse we give him? Absolutely not! He came from Milan and became a Madridista. He is very vocal about it. We owe so much to him. And above all, he was a gentleman. He is my favorite manager along with Zidane. Gracias Carlo \u2764\ufe0f",

How did you see all this evolution that he had until he arrived in the white team and all this process that he is going through?**\n\n\"Franco's situation is a bit similar to that of Nico Paz. He is a very young boy, even younger than Nico, who has taken a giant step in his career, to a club that is huge, and all in due time.\n\n\"Luckily, his coach understands him, he knows very well what is there, and they are going to take him in the way they see fit. Let's not forget how old he is, let's not forget the step he's taken, and I think Real Madrid are aware of that and they're going to take him in the way they see he can move up. Let's understand that he is a young boy and that he needs to adapt.\n\n\"We, as a coaching staff, believe in his possibilities, and as far as we think it's convenient and that he can contribute, we will use him. And if we see that it's not yet the right time, we'll do that too, but it's clear that he has a huge future ahead of him.\n\n**Do you see him mature at the age of 18, and that he really feels football as if he has always played for Real Madrid, in these first matches?**\n\n\"Yes, he is a boy who shows maturity, he shows that he wants to learn, and it is clear that he has fantastic conditions and that he has to exploit them, as long as the club, his teammates and the coach understand that he is 18 years old.",

It was no fluke that he was respected by big players like KDB. Our CBs besides Dean are either on the older side or injury prone. I'm not saying we should forgive everything, but he will never build back his confidence if he rides the bench. Maybe easing him into late games against smaller teams or rotating him with Alaba.\n\nI'm just traumatized from last year's backline situation.

But let\u2019s not put dirt on our own.\n\nIn before people react to this with \u201ccriticism should be possible\u201d: yes, absolutely, but do it respectfully.

        "title": "La Liga: The Most \u201cElite\u201d Amateur League in the World",
        "content": "Honestly, how does La Liga still market itself as one of the top leagues in the world when every week there's another scandal?\n\n**Referee scandals everywhere** \u2013 First the Negreira case, where Barcelona paid a former referees\u2019 official for \u201cconsulting\u201d over years. And the story of a ref whose company allegedly had business ties with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, or another ref who had a painting of Messi on his garden wall. And of course, there\u2019s supposedly no conflict of interest, and the fact that these refs keep making the most questionable decisions against Madrid is just a coincidence. And those were just two of the bigger scandals from last season that involved Real Madrid. Every single week there are smaller controversies \u2014 and bigger ones affecting other teams too \u2014 with absolutely no sign of things improving anytime soon.\n\n**No goal-line technology in 2025** \u2013 Every other major league solved this problem a decade ago. Meanwhile in Spain, you\u2019re still relying on VAR guesswork and dodgy camera angles to decide if a ball crossed the line in billion-euro competitions.\n\n**Offside tech behind the times** \u2013 The Premier League uses thicker lines to account for the 2\u20135 cm margin of error in frame rates and calibration. La Liga? Paper-thin lines and decisions made down to a single pixel, even though the technology itself admits it isn\u2019t that precise. Just look at Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s goal in the last match \u2014 it was clearly onside. How can anyone in this league seriously rule a player offside by 1 mm when experts agree the system has a 2\u20135 cm error margin?\n\n**And sometimes, VAR just\u2026 \"doesn\u2019t work\"** - Somehow, in 2025, there are still games where VAR goes completely offline for \"technical reasons\", leaving clubs in billion-euro competitions at the mercy of human error like it\u2019s 1995.\n\n**Home advantage? Let\u2019s sell it to the US** \u2013 Instead of fixing officiating or infrastructure, La Liga wants to stage league games in the United States, stripping smaller clubs of one of the only equalizers they have: home turf advantage.\n\n**Then there\u2019s the racism** - Week after week, Black players \u2014 especially stars like Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior \u2014 face racist abuse from the stands, and the response from the league is embarrassingly weak. No other top-five league even comes close to this level of repeated incidents with so little action taken.\n\nCorruption scandals, outdated technology, decisions made with zero regard for sporting fairness, racism, and bizarre scheduling issues \u2014 this league needs a complete overhaul before it can even be called professional. But Tebas seems to care more about money than about \u201cunnecessary\u201d things like fairness and integrity.\n\n**\"This isn\u2019t football. This is La Liga.\"**\n\n\n*Edit: I\u2019ve added the racism issue as well. Sorry for forgetting this other unique feature of La Liga.*",

I've been seeing a lot of content from RM Play and I'm seriously considering signing up for the premium/paid version, but I have a few questions for those of you who already have it.\n\nCondensed Replays: I've heard they have 30-minute condensed match replays. How good are they? Do they do a good job of showing the flow of the match and not just the goals and highlights? Is this the best way to catch up on a match you missed without committing to the full 90?\n\nHistorical Content: One of the big selling points for me would be the historical archives. What's the content like? Are there a lot of full matches from past seasons, or is it mostly documentaries and short clips? I'd love to re-watch some of the classic Champions League finals.\n\nSpoilers: This is a big one. For those of you who watch replays, is it easy to navigate the app and find the game without getting spoiled by the score in the thumbnail or title? How long does it take for the replays to post?\n\nApp Functionality (Roku): Since I'm in the US and primarily use a Roku, I'm concerned about the app's performance. Does the app work well on Roku devices? Is it buggy? Does it buffer a lot? I've seen some mixed reviews for other platforms.\n\nAny and all feedback would be super helpful. Just want to make sure the value is there before I commit. Thanks in advance and Hala Madrid!",

You can\u2019t help but feel bad, as he truly deserves more chances. What are your views on this?",

I imagine most people will think meh because he\u2019s not the big flashy signing like konate, saliba, etc. HOWEVER, this guy is the type of personality we want. Calm guy. Has stepped up to every level he\u2019s been asked to. Like when he stepped up to playing for the English national team which is a pressure cooker. He\u2019s got a great, professional personality. Just look at how he handled his potential transfer to Liverpool all summer, continuing to put his head down and playing til the last game for crystal palace. If we can get him for free, I know this guy is not the type to come in demanding Alaba-like wages. I regularly watch the prem and I\u2019m a big fan. Would love to see this. \n",

One of the best footballers and I know people appreciate him at Betis but wow was this dude something else. I feel bad for anybody who didn't get to see his peak. Dude was doing shit only a handful of players can. Go watch his highlights and tell me he is not one of the most technical footballers of all time",
