I have read that tickets for games that are not el clasico, Madrid derby etc you can usually get at the stadium the day of. Is that a true statement still? I have seen tickets for sale on sites like StubHub or viagogo, are those sold by season ticket holders? Because I know the tickets don\u2019t usually go on sale until the week of, unless you get the hospitality tickets. I see tickets for around $300 to sit in the middle of the stadium which is what I would be interested in, but is that a fair price to pay? Or should I rather wait until I\u2019m there?\n\nIf anyone has went to a game last season, any input would be appreciated. ",

They reinforced their squad and it seems they are gonna sign Isak aswell, a player that would be perfect for our club. \n\nimo, it would be a crazy achievement from Xabi if we manage to have an amazing season and I hope that the fans and the board don't blame Xabi cuz he doesnt have the players he wants for the footbal he wants to play.",

For one that Rodrygo is going to leave the club the signs were there as early \"Don't Forget the R\" propaganda last summer/early fall. As soon as I saw Rodrygo getting benched in the CWC I knew it was over. Xabi was sending a message and it breaks my heart. \n\nThe other fact is that Rodrygo is nowhere near a move right now depsite rumors being hot all summer. Imo the best fit for him was Bayern and they overpaid for Diaz instead. Liverpool has already spent a lot and currently going for Isak. Then you got Arsenal who seems to have opted for a RW backup and other bench pieces instead of a bona fide starter at LW instead. \n\nHonestly idk how Al Hilal hasn't swooped in and even offered half or 75% of what they were offering to Real Madrid and Vini. I think the club would accept that in a heartbeat and it might turn Rodrygo's head. I mean its turning Vini's. ",

        "title": "Rodrygo Has Run Out of Options",
        "content": "Rodrygo Goes, the Brazilian winger at Real Madrid, finds himself in a complex situation regarding his professional future. Despite being highly regarded in Europe, his role at the club has been drastically reduced, with very limited participation in key matches like the Copa del Rey final and the Club World Cup final. Real Madrid is considering selling him to complete two crucial transactions in the transfer window, though no formal offers have yet been received.\n\nClubs such as Bayern Munich and Liverpool have opted for other targets, while Arsenal has not advanced beyond preliminary interest. Only Tottenham remains as a potential suitor, albeit a less prominent one. This leaves Rodrygo with few alternatives amid declining physical and emotional condition, having lost weight and confidence. The club would only entertain offers of around \u20ac100 million, which presents a significant hurdle in today\u2019s competitive market.\n\nA Market in Flux\n\nAs the global market heads toward a high-stakes finish in spending, there are still players looking for a new space to shine. Rodrygo, born in 2001 in Osasco, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, is among them  \ufffc.\n\nWhile he\u2019s on many clubs\u2019 radar, and Real Madrid hasn\u2019t yet received an official offer, the club\u2019s planning includes his departure to fund the final moves needed to complete their dream squad  \ufffc. Rodrygo played only 45 minutes in the Copa del Rey final against Barcelona in April and 92 minutes in the Club World Cup\u2014indicating how limited his game time has become  \ufffc.\n\nAlthough Rodrygo and his representatives have publicly expressed his desire to remain at Madrid, reports suggest the club views him as a transfer candidate following his substitution in the Copa del Rey final  \ufffc.\n\nPhysical and Mental Decline\n\nSince then, Rodrygo has struggled with a physical imbalance that caused him to lose nearly five kilos, as well as an emotional downturn due to his lack of effectiveness in front of goal. Even a stay in Brazil with his two children did not fully help him clear his mind  \ufffc.\n\nInterest Fading from Big Clubs\n\nDespite maintaining a strong reputation across Europe, major clubs are looking elsewhere. Bayern has decided to sign Luis D\u00edaz (for around \u20ac80 million) and Liverpool has not progressed its interest in Rodrygo. Real Madrid insists on offers close to \u20ac100 million if a sale is to happen  \ufffc.\n\nLiverpool\u2019s considerable winter spending\u2014such as Wirtz (\u20ac125M) and Ekitike (\u20ac95M)\u2014may also explain the lack of movement regarding Rodrygo  \ufffc. Meanwhile, Arsenal has already invested roughly \u20ac200 million in Zubimendi (\u20ac70M), Madueke (\u20ac56M), and Gy\u00f6keres (\u20ac75M), reducing appetite for another major forward signing  \ufffc.\n\nOnly Tottenham remains an option\u2014but it\u2019s seen as a step down compared to the other clubs. Gradually, Rodrygo is running out of viable alternatives to leave Real Madrid this summer  ",
