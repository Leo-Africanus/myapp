        "content": "Liverpool in 2011 and Benfica in 2026: Clubs defending players accused of racism. Loyalty or liability?\n\nIn 2011, Luis Su\u00e1rez was banned for 8 matches after racially abusing Patrice Evra. Liverpool players then wore shirts with his image during warm-ups. This decision shocked fans and sparked widespread criticism. At the time, social media was smaller and outrage more contained, but it still left a lasting mark on the club\u2019s reputation.\n\nFast forward to 2026: Benfica is defending Gianluca Prestianni after UEFA\u2019s anti-racism protocol was triggered in their Champions League match against Real Madrid. The club posted on social media emphasizing support for their player and casting doubt on the reports from Vin\u00edcius Jr.\n\nWhat stands out is the tension clubs face between **internal cohesion** and **external pressure**. On one hand, they want to protect their players, preserve locker room trust, and maintain authority internally. On the other, public perception, social media scrutiny, and the risk of reputational or commercial damage are enormous\u00a0 far larger than in 2011.\n\nBoth incidents show how clubs try to balance loyalty with accountability, often under the microscope of global audiences. It raises the question: are clubs prioritizing the right thing, or are short-term optics and internal politics still overshadowing moral responsibility?\n\n**Benfica Posts Links:**\n\n[https://x.com/SLBenfica/status/2023935602693915020?s=20](https://x.com/SLBenfica/status/2023935602693915020?s=20)\n\n[https://x.com/SLBenfica/status/2023943527906844839?s=20](https://x.com/SLBenfica/status/2023943527906844839?s=20)\n\n  \n",

It\u2019s funny how many liked to claim that he had \u201cno tactics\u201d. Then we got a tactics coach in Xabi and he did not even last a full season. Ancelotti always knew what he was doing and how to manage the locker room. The more time goes on, the more I appreciate and understand his way of thinking. The only reasonable flaw I see in him is his tendency to not play youth players. Besides that, he always knew how to manage the team and how to adapt to the players. ",

        "content": "Hi Madridistas,\n\nI\u2019ve spent the last few weeks building an Interactive LaLiga Simulator that includes a Dynamic All-Time Historical Table (ranking every team since 1929).\n\nI was testing some scenarios today and the data is impressive: Even in the wildest \"comeback\" scenarios for other teams, Real Madrid\u2019s lead in the historical standings is massive. I wanted to build something that would let you see exactly how this season\u2019s points contribute to Madrid\u00b4s overall history.\n\nWhat can you do with the tool?\n\n* **Simulate the rest of the season**: Enter your predicted scores for every remaining match.\n* **Real-Time Historical Impact:** Your predictions for this season are added instantly to the All-Time Table. You can see how many more points Madrid need to reach a specific lead over the 2nd place.\n* **Goal Records:** Keep track of Goal Difference (GD) and Goals For (GF) to see how the current squad compares to historical records.\n* **Segunda Divisi\u00f3n:** I\u2019ve also added the second tier for those interested in seeing which historic clubs might be promoted next season.\n\n**The \"Challenge\":** Can Madrid reach a lead of more than 100 points over the 2nd place in the historical table by the end of this season? I\u2019ve tried a few simulations and it looks like you are on track for a legendary gap.\n\nCheck it out here: [https://calculafutbol.com/](https://calculafutbol.com/)\n\nI\u2019m a solo developer and a football fan, so I\u2019d love to get your feedback on the tool, the UI, or if you think I should add more historical stats (like total titles or win percentages).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dv7yxu1fimkg1.png?width=1416&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4752a8ac9ab70ffc4f8029eeb4327cc6f75fc53f\n\n",
