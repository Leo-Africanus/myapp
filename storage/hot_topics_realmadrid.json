Cross from the left side by Liberto, Barroso's header from a tight angle is saved, but Marseille's Calisto, lying on the floor decides to lob his keeper and score for us! \n\n60' - big 1v1 save by Javi Navarro after Marseille are through on the left wing on the counter\n\n\ud83d\udd04 62' - Melvin and Y\u00e1\u00f1ez come on for Bail\u00f3n and Adri P\u00e9rez\n\n\ud83d\udd04 72' - Roberto Mart\u00edn comes on for Carlos D\u00edez\n\n\u26bd 73' - Marseille score again, again it's Mmadi, and again it's absolutely terrible defending, 3-4 players cover the player with the ball, but absolutely no one is near Mmadi in the box, who as all the time to finish calmly past Navarro\n\n80' - Barroso scores after the keeper spills a free kick by Y\u00e1\u00f1ez, but he was offside \n\n\u26bd 81' - GOLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - Juvenil A get the ball back quickly and arrive with dynamism, Y\u00e1\u00f1ez puts Melvin through on the wing, who puts in a great low cross for Roberto - he touches the ball perfectly to direct it into the bottom left corner, nice goal and the deserved equaliser\n\n86' - penalty for Juvenil A - Roberto Mart\u00edn's free kick is blocked by the OM players elbow - I think it's pretty harsh, his elbow was in front of his face, not extending the surface of his body \n\n\u26bd 88' - GOLLLL DEL JUVENIL A - Barroso steps up and converts! \n\nFT - the final whistle finally arrives, after Juvenil A managed to keep OM away from our goal entirely foe the rest of the match, locking the ball away at the opposing corner flag for most of the time. Important and deserved win for Juvenil A - the goals were all a bit weird and against the run of play, with the first OM goal being offside and right after a potential penalty for Real Madrid, the first equaliser being an incredible own goal by Calisto, and the winner for Real Madrid was also not a penalty imo - but in the end, even though the course of the match was full of unexpected turnarounds, the result is fully deserved after our U19s were the more dangerous team throughout the vast majority of the game \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 16:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee:** Snir Levy (ISR)\n\n**Competition:** UEFA Youth League, League Phase\n\n**Viewing options:** [RMTV/RM PLAY](https://play.realmadrid.com/home)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Juvenil A XI (4-4-3):** Javi Navarro - V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as, Ariel Nkoghe, Ferr\u00e1n Seco, Javi Bail\u00f3n (62' Melvin Ukpeigbe) - Izan Regueira, Carlos D\u00edez (72' Roberto Mart\u00edn), Diego Mart\u00ednez \u2018Beto\u2019 (40' Pol Dur\u00e1n) - Liberto Navascu\u00e9s, Alfonso Romero (46' Jaime Barroso), Adri P\u00e9rez (62' Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez) \n\nBench: \u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez (GK), Mario Rivas, Bruno Galassi, \u00c1lvaro Lezcano, Roberto Mart\u00edn. \n\nCoach: Juli\u00e1n L\u00f3pez de Lerma\n",

Even if I get a WISE card and join Madrista it seems the odds of getting tickets are not guaranteed. The weekend we'll be there they are playing Elche which I think might be an easier ticket. However, to be on the safe side I looked at the VIP tix, which are 350 euros each for Premium 636. \n\n  \nIs the VIP worth it? If I was looking in the same section on StubHub would the price be about the same? I can't wait till the last minute to try and buy the tickets as it would cause me too much stress. \n\n  \nAlso - when do you find out if the game is Saturday or Sunday? Anything else I need to know? Its for my son's 20th birthday, and he is a big fan. Thanks!",

        "content": "Here are just 5 times when Real Madrid rewrote fate. When hope seemed lost, and when the impossible felt real, they forced the chains of reality in their favour.\n\nLook closely, at the joy in their faces, the weight l4 ted in those smiles, the sheer relief in the embrace. Every header, every strike, every sprint tells a story of resilience, of faith, of those who bleed white no matter the odds.\n\nSome of these players were giants in their time, some quiet dreamers who seized the moment. All of them remind us why we love this game, why we love this club.\n\nLife may throw the impossible at us, but if they can see it through to the final whistle, so can we.\n\n// 004 \\[Remontada. Remontada.\\]\n\n\\- MadridNoir \ud83e\udd0d\ud83d\udc51",
