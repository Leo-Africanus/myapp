        "content": "I really think our last ten years have been shaped by that crazy 9248 goal in the 2014 Champions League final. Think about it, if Atl\u00e9tico had won that one, who knows what would have happened at Real Madrid? The whole club could have gone in a totally different direction. Our success since then has been about that never-say-die attitude, those late winners, and the sheer belief the guys have had. Now everyone fights for every ball. Before 2014, it felt like some of our players just kind of accepted losing to European teams. As a Madridista since 2005, I've seen it all. And it's awesome that some of the legends from that 2014 team are still around, showing the young guys how to win those big games.",

(Since hotel can be cancelled).\n\nI read that they will confirm the dates up to three weeks prior to the matches. And i have been waiting up until now to book plane.\n\nThe thing is they are supposted to play 9th of march, but the match is still to be confirmed.  \nI would like to NOT risk loosing $1.000 on plane tickets, but i also feel like i can't wait much longer, due to ticket prices just being higher and higher.\n\nDo anyone have an idea of when the match will be confirmed? Or if there is a big chance that they wont move it?",
