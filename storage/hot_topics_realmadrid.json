Now having the opportunity to see a new defensive player with that same kind of on-field attitude and technical/physical presence feels like a gift. \n\nStepped into a squad that isn\u2019t generally kind to academy players (in terms of their longevity and usually justified based on the quality of player we sign) and he\u2019s hit every performance metric and looks so comfortable doing it. The fact that he successfully slide tackles multiple times a game alone is enough for my vote. Give him the #4. ",

I know he's quite young and still has a long way to go to become the best in the game, but considering his age, the way he plays, his passion, hunger, and madness, he's already showing leadership qualities reminiscent of our own Sergio Ramos.\n\nLast night, he played his part perfectly, never looking out of place and remaining composed throughout the game. That 'get up' moment when he channeled his inner Sergio Ramos, I was beyond happy to see that we might have another player with a similar personality and talent.\n\nAsencio is not only talented but also has great potential. He's excellent on the ball, incredibly fast, and can defend with both his front and back foot. Especially, His pace is insane, and I'm sure the more he plays, the better he'll become.\n\nFor now, he should be our undisputed starter. The positive takeaways from the game for me were Raul Asencio and Rodrygo's consistent good performances lately.\n\nI hope Madrid takes care of this young talent and helps him develop to his full potential. If they do, we might just see another Sergio Ramos emerge!",

I hope Ancelotti will stop using Mendy in big games, and please don't tell me that Mendy is better at defence.. Mendy this season is good at nothing! \n\nWhat a performance by Fran Garcia \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4f",
