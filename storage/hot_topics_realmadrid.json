It is just a minor cramp and he should be fine to start against barcelona\n\n  \nKylian mbappe is travelling to Jeddah to join the rest of the team but it is still unsure that he will start or not. It will be decided tomorrow if he is fit to train. Although medical staff are confident that he is fine. \n\n  \nBellingham was limping yesterday but he is fine. It was just a cramp from the match after playing for 90 minute. \n\n  \nTrent is not going to play against barcelona as he is yet to participate in group training. He is expected to return against villareal or benfica ( Last week of january ).\n\n  \nHope everybody recover well and win the supercopa. Hala madrid y nada mas",

        "content": "Hats off to you Aurelien. You\u2019ve been balling for weeks and no one gives you thanks. In the past you\u2019ve been booed by our own fans and you continue to give it all for the Madrid shirt. Your commitment is elite. Keep working in the shadows, sooner or later people will recognize the work you put in day in day out. I hope you renew and stay with us many more years.",
