That they don\u2019t see the real issue - being our lack of defensive players. \n\nWe have a youth team that gets no trust, what kind of message does that send to younger players? We have Asencio who has showed game after game that he deserves a spot in the starting eleven, yet he\u2019s benched. We have to watch Lucas Vazquez make a fool out of himself week after week, my dead grandmother could defend better - I\u2019m sure someone in Castilla could do better than that, but no\u2026\n\nThe board and management has gone mad, and it shows in Carlo\u2019s press conferences lately\u2026 to blame the referees after yesterday\u2019s game won\u2019t get us anywhere, they need to wake up\u2026",

        "content": "It seems like 10 trophies in 3 seasons won by Ancelotti isn't enough to be trusted by a subreddit full of armchair football experts. So maybe a comparison of this season's results will put some light on how deluded this fanbase has become recently:\n\n*Season 24/25 all competitions*\n\nManager | Games | Won | Drawn | Lost\n---------|----------|----------|-----------|--------\nAncelotti | 24 | 15 | 4 | 5\nFlick | 23 | 17 | 2 | 4\nSimeone | 24 | 16 | 5 | 3\nXabi Alonso | 24 | 16 | 6 | 2\nGuardiola | 24 | 12 | 5 | 7\nArteta | 24 | 14 | 7 | 3\nMotta | 22 | 9 | 12 | 1\nDe Zerbi | 15 | 9 | 3 | 3\n\nAll these names were mentioned now or earlier as a clear step-up from Carlo \"Dinosaur with dementia\" Ancelotti, or just as names we should look on to when talking about world class managers. But are their results much better? No, they aren't. Did they have to face 27 injuries in the first squad since the start of the season, like Carlo did? No, only Flick and Guardiola faced a lot of injuries (but still not as many) and their results are similar to ours.\n\nBut if you read some posts on r/realmadrid, you'll be thinking that Ancelotti has some kind of an abysmal record this season, and that coaches like Xabi or Arteta would certainly do wonders in Madrid. This is based on absolutely nothing.\n\nIf you want to fire a manager who got 10 trophies in 3 seasons, including 2x UCL title, when we still have a chance for every trophy this season, you're just lacking spine and faith. This isn't video game and having great players doesn't mean the club will trash every team 4-0, the season is always full of ups and downs and it was like that even with Zidane winning 3 UCLs in a row. Stop being delusional and start actually SUPPORTING the club, have some fucking faith. We really don't need more plastics who turn their backs on the club, manager and players every time we lose some points. There are a lot of them already, and we as a sub should do better.",

Deserved lead for Castilla who have been pushing hard for the lead here already \n\n17' - V\u00edctor's shot is deflected, leaving the keeper without a chance, but it hits the post and goes out for a corner - Castilla now pushing for the second\n\n20' - next chance for V\u00edctor, but the keeper parries from a tight angle! \n\n\u26bd 32' - goal for Recre - first time they have some dangerous possession and they get a corner.. It's played short and the cross is brought in from deep, Fran Gonz\u00e1lez storms out of his goal into absolute nowhere and Rub\u00e9n Serrano can head it into the empty net... You just can't win matches with a keeper that fucks up so frequently... \n\nHT - great start by Castilla who scored early and had multiple chances to extend their lead - then what happened is what always happens, the team gave up control completely, got scored on in basically the first opportunity, and has struggled to show any reaction since then - they lack any consistency even within the duration of one half, they need countless chances to score a single goal, then concede with one stupid blunder - impossible to win matches like this\n\n46' - 2nd half underway \n\n\u26bd 54' - GOLLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - Gonzalo turns his man and marches forward through Recre's midfield, then releases a great through ball to Victor, who keeps his calm and finishes near post with force! Now we need to hold the lead this time around... \n\n\ud83d\udd04 71' - Pol Fortuny off for Loren Aguado \n\n\ud83d\udd04 85' - Victor Valdepe\u00f1as on for David Jim\u00e9nez \n\nFT - a small fight breaks out after the final whistle, not sure what it was about - doesn't matter, 3 super important points for Castilla in the battle against relegation. The team started both halves very well, scoring after exactly 8 minutes played in either half and having chances to amplify their lead. Then they gradually lost control and allowed Recre back into the game, but in the second half, Ra\u00fal's team managed to defend the lead with maturity and calmness.

        "title": "Ancelotti, Endrick and the youngsters",
        "content": "Ancelotti has been criticised for the few opportunities he gives to youngsters and here is my point of view\n\nThis is not new for the coach There was the same controversy with Arda Guler last season in 21/22 I remember that there were many complaints with the management of Valverde and Camavinga and that is that they did not play at all, if you remember CMK would play until the end with changes of 2 minutes at most \n\nIt is not until the tie with PSG where in the first leg we are embarrassed, but some events occur Casemiro is suspended for accumulation of yellow cards and Kross seems to arrive with discomfort, in the return with PSG, without Casemiro he puts Valverde, Modric and Kross still injured, we continue to be subjected by PSG until they change Kross and Ascensio for Camavinga and Rodrygo changes that would become constant in the 14th, \n\nIt is not to the point where he has no other choice but to give Valverde and Camavinga a chance, who easily dominate the PSG midfield and most of the rivals we would face, which was contrary to the performance of the CMK that was subdued by any top team in Europe, but despite this, this mythical midfielder remains intact until the following season where we play the European Super Cup with the CMK and the first league games until Casemiro decides to go to United, because Tchouameni and Camavinga would not even smell the field without this\n\nbut why does he do this? Ancelotti has his way of leadership or managing the squad and he does not want problems, the veterans, those who have weight in the locker room, the expensive signing or the one with a high salary are going to have priority, In the elimination at the Etihad, despite Rudiger's incredible performance, he put Alaba in for the return match despite the fact that he had just recovered from an injury. In the Super Cup and the classics of that season, he was very insistent with Modric and Kross together and he changed Camavinga or Tochouameni despite the fact that Barca physically surpassed that combination. \n\nbut it is because he does not want problems because the players get angry, on the field Kross has made faces, Modric leaked his discontent last season to the press, Rodrygo has made faces and created a scandal because the newspaper Marca omitted him from the photo with Mbappe, Belli and Vini and Ancelotti in his vision is to please the big names of the club, this is his vision of leadership, it applies to the rest of the squad, because he continued and continues to call up players of a similar level to play in the first division, see Hazard, Vallejo, Bale, Isco, Mariano, Marcelo, why would it be better to have Miguel Gutierrez than Marcelo or the next squad level where we don't have Medy and we had to play with Camavinga in that position? Miguel did play for Real, he made a mistake against Sheriff and was never called up again. Wouldn't it be better to have Nico Paz this season? He might have scored a goal in the UCL and disappeared. \n\nI don't want to belittle Ancelotti's achievements, he's there for a reason. Managing a dressing room isn't easy. Many coaches would lose the team in a short time, especially those who like to be protagonists (Ten Hag) but also he is the worst type of coache for this moment in Real Madrid, a time when the board makes do with what they have, they don't renew or sign various positions on the field, a time when half the team was a veteran of the 3 Champions Leagues and you needed to renew yourself and make a transition and where you are with a long calendar where you need to maximize your resources but as we see Ancelotti voluntarily shortens them, Even if the youth team or a promising youngster were better than Luca Vazquez, he will not put him in because that would bother the current captain of the team",
