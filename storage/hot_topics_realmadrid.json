It\u2019s frustrating how quickly narratives shift when fans need a scapegoat. Vini has flaws like any player, but pretending he doesn\u2019t work or press is pure fiction.",

One of them also posted their actions on social media.  \nThe defendants have acknowledged the events, expressed their remorse and publicly apologised. Each of them has been found guilty of a hate crime and a threat against our player Vinicius Jr.  \nThe court sentenced one of the defendants to one year and ten months in prison and the others to one year and two months.  \n  \nThe defendants will also have to pay the fines handed down, will be banned from exercising professions related to education and sport for a further three years, and have been banned from approaching Vinicius Jr. within 1,000 metres and from communicating in any way with him for four years.  \n  \nIn addition, they will not be allowed to attend or go near any football stadiums where sporting events are taking place during this period of time, and they will have to complete a training programme on equal treatment and non-discrimination.  \n  \nThis criminal conviction comes in addition to the several already handed down in recent months for racist insults received by Real Madrid C.F. players at the stadiums of Zorrilla (Valladolid), Mestalla (Valencia), Son Moix (Palma de Mallorca) and Vallecas (Madrid), including in digital forums. In total, fourteen people have now been criminally convicted of racist attacks against players of our club.  \n  \nReal Madrid has joined its player in prosecuting this case, and in many others currently underway, and will continue to work to protect the values of our club and to eradicate any racist behaviour in the world of football and sport.",
