        "title": "Why some fans are so Limited?",
        "content": "I\u2019ve been a Real Madrid fan since 2002, when I was 8 years old. Back then, it was just a random pick, but I stuck with the team through thick and thin\u2014even during the less successful years between 2004 and 2010. I watched every match from 2004 to 2017, but as I grew older, I found myself with less time to keep up. Even so, I\u2019ve always loved the team, even if I can\u2019t follow every match like I used to.\n\nFor years, I\u2019ve been active in Facebook groups dedicated to Real Madrid, where I\u2019ve shared opinions and discussions about the team. Some of these groups I\u2019ve been a part of for over 10 years. Lately, though, I\u2019ve found myself becoming more of a critic like general in life, and like to question everything to get the reality. It is also true with some of the issues I see around the team in this season. When I try to talk about these problems with other fans, I often encounter a lot of defensiveness. Some people just can't seem to handle criticism\u2014they instantly label anyone with a negative opinion as a \u201cfake fan\u201d and get really aggressive and talking shit even toward other supporters.\n\nIt\u2019s not that it irritates me so much as it\u2019s just kind of strange. I don\u2019t get why some fans can't see criticism as a legitimate point of view rather than a personal attack. I\u2019m curious\u2014why do you think some fans are so limited in their perspective? Does this happen with other teams too, or is it just something I\u2019ve noticed with Real Madrid fans?\n\nHala Madrid.",
