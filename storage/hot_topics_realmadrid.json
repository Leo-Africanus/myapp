Vinicius was starting to dribble again and tried making chances today and some people are saying \"Oh Vini Mbappe isn't going to work.\" Mbappe is literally our Centre Forward, how do you expect him to find spaces when there are 2 to 3 players always surrounding you? And then there are those players who say \"Rodrygo &gt; Vini.\" Yeah sure. If he ever gets gametime. No disrespect to Rodrygo but what is the point of comparison when the guy is uncertain about his future at the club? Yes he is a great dribbler but Vinicius also performed better than the dogshit he was dropping since the past 6 months. We just have to be patient it's the FIRST MATCH of the season. ",

Alexander-Arnold's arrival from Liverpool was Real's most high-profile piece of business this summer, but he may have to split game time with the Spaniard, who came fourth in the Ballon d'Or last year.\" \n\nThoughts? Have you seen enough from Trent to think he should be first-choice right-back? I know he was a free transfer, but still Trent was a high-profile signing. Personally having watched a lot of Liverpool, Trent can definitely be a defensive liability, especially in 1v1s, but offensively he can make attacking passes that very few other players can. I suspect Alonso will make his choice as the season progresses and based on the opponent's style of play/wingers that would matchup against right-back.   \n",

He was outplayed a couple of times but I think he will get better, for now his passes aren\u2019t working like in Liverpool but again I think it will come.\nCarreras: a decent game from him , he got pace and he is aggressive in defending which is beneficial.I think he and Fran gonna give us a solid stack for the season.\nFranco M. : can\u2019t tell much but I can see his potential.\n\n\nSo, Xabi is basically cooking for a month+ and I can see the positives : energy, desire, running, motion.\nStill there is some of Ancelotti\u2019s habits but it will go away. Those habits could be labeled as a con in today\u2019s game , we just need some time.\nI think in 5 matches and throughout them we\u2019ll get to clicking.\n\nLots of \u201cbuts\u201d but I will stay positive.\n\nBTW, happy for Carvajal and it was not good to see him falling down near the end of match.",

        "content": "In my opinion, no bias:\n\nChampions League: Winners. PSG is falling apart (losing Donnarumma probably and of course showed they can lose when Chelsea beat them). Strong opponents: Chelsea, still beatable though; PSG of course but we can beat them; Liverpool too but still very beatable.\n\nLa Liga: 2nd place. Negreira league, can't do anything about it... LITERALLY. Idc what some of you will say here. ''Oh victim mentality'' ask Mallorca players. Easy.\n\nCopa del Rey: Winners. \n\nSupercopa de Espana: Winners. We beat atletico then barca just like 2 seasons ago.\n\nTell me yours.",

        "content": "I have been really curious about Rodrygo situation and simply i am not able understand what is the problem with him. He is very talented player and there were moments I would choose him over Vini as well. Last season especially in the second half he couldn\u2019t perform but team was poor overall and I don\u2019t think Rodrygo was doing worse than team overall. I would expect him to be a solid choice for Alonso but somehow since he joined there is a clear sign from him that he doesn\u2019t consider Rodrygo in future. While this is one aspect of the situation the other aspect is Rodrygo\u2019s alternatives. Currently against Osasuna Brahim is starting I mean Rodrygo is way better than Diaz how does it make sense to pick Brahim over Rodrygo. What do you think? What am I missing?",
