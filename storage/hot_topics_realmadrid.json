I remember people in 2010-11 thinking Messi and Pep Barca will dominate European football for the next 10 years. Mourinho, despite his record breaking 2011-12, was absolutely thrashed by the press and fans due to Casillas incident. \n\nThe same thing over and over again. \"Mbappe is a big ego loser\", \"Vini is finished\". Xabi has a lot of work to do and the team needs a DEFENSIVE overahaul. I don't expect anything special this season, we have clearly entered a rebuilding phase after Kroos - Modric - Carlo departure. If we win a domestic trophy, it will be a success. \n",

But let\u2019s not forget that he\u2019s only played three games(was out sick, lost 5 kgs) two off the bench. The actual season hasn\u2019t even started yet. Players are still building fitness and chemistry, and Xabi Alonso is still figuring out the system.\n\nCriticism is okay, that\u2019s a part of football. But what I\u2019m seeing isn\u2019t just criticism, it\u2019s pure hate. We wanted Mbapp\u00e9 for years, he did okay this season, and now some fans are turning on him, let's not be too quick and let Xabi have his time with him. He's arguably the best in the world currently and Xabi will get him to play that way. \n\nLet's just step back and let Xabi do his thing. ",

Why didn\u2019t Leverkusen maintain that same momentum in the following season?

Look at it this way, we did better than Inter, and they had a better season than us.\n\nWe have some talented players. We got a talented coach. Give the man some time to cook before we all start losing our minds. Despite the tragic 4-0 loss, I am super excited and optimistic about next season.\n\nJust my 2 cents. Let me know your thoughts on the matter.",

        "content": "To me the biggest issue is that our midfield never has the ball against big teams. We always struggle to even get the ball in the first place so does getting a creative midfielder really fix that? But I guess that's why we're gonna be using the 3-5-2. But at the same time it's kinda crazy because all these other big teams could get the ball with only 3 midfielders so why can we never do the same?",

        "title": "A perspective on Rodrygo that I don't see talked about",
        "content": "I think we all saw the recent reports coming in that Rodrygo wants to stay at the club, I was surprised at first as he seemed to definitely be leaving due to his lack of minutes at the CWC and all the buzz surrounding his situation in the media. However I think it's starting to make more sense to me and here's why : I think Rodrygo sees the writing on the wall that Vini &amp; Mbapp\u00e9 (in their current form &amp; attitude) can't coexist, and he sees that as an opening to secure a starting spot at LW ahead of one of them. He presses, works hard on defense which is something Xabi appreciates, his numbers are low but maybe he can improve under Xabi. Vini for example also has incredibly low G/As recently compared to what we usually expect of him, and doesn't even bother to do the work off the ball - something that Rodrygo is willing to do.\n\nI'm also quite concerned about Vini's contract situation, his contract ends in 2027 and neither him or the club seem to be budging on their demands. I believe that he has no right to ask for a 30m wage while performing the way he does and the attitude he's been showing, and I think the club might force him to make a decision this summer because if he doesn't renew, next summer he'll only have 1 year left on his contract and the club would lose a lot of leverage if he were to be sold. Maybe Rodrygo is aware of this and is waiting to see how it plays out.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",
