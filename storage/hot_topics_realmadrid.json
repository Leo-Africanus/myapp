Quick thoughts, anger, frustration, future lineups, players we should get rid of and sign, etc. Most of these posts have been removed.\n\nSimilar to the announcement that I made after the Arsenal loss, please direct these to the post-match thread and the open thread. There are too many posts going up right now that it\u2019s flooding the home page and most are getting removed. If your post is lengthy and generates its own discussion by itself, it could be posted in the future. There is too much urgency in the sub right now for everyone making their own post. \n\nThank you for your time \ud83d\ude0a ",

We saw how Arteta demanded respect and inlisted discipline into his players. Flick has shown that he can be a friend to his players and take no nonesense. \n\nI really hope Xabi is a manager that takes no bullshit. I dont care who you are, if you are lacking disciple, u need to get benched. \n\n\nI honestly love how Mbappe is coolheaded. Aside from that red card incident, i feel that he is not involving himself in these antics from our other players.",

Vini going down after every tackle, even me whos sitting thousands of mile away, watching on 360p on buffering stream can see that was  clear ball and then he has the audacity to ask for a card. The cherry on the top is that he then just gives up. No or very little attempt to retake the ball. \nBesides, it goes deeper after arsenal game carvajal was choking saka, rudi standing on mls like bruh come on. You're setting a bad example for the juniors. \nSomething really needs to be done, we've become a laughing stock Infront of the world.\n",

I know Rodrigo had some flashes but short lived. \n\n\nWe get pissed at Vini dribbling down far left corner while being crowded but there is no constant threat from the right to split opposition\u2019s defence. Cr7 had the luxury of  Dimaria &amp; Bale. Will Trent solve this? ",

        "content": "We can actually establish the fact that the so called big 4 of this team should not play at the same time. Rodrygo was given the chance of his life to show the world what he is capable of and for the most part was pocketed by 2nd choice player to balde. He is in no position to be a starter at this point. Can't shoot for his life. Can't carry the ball forward. Can't connect a 1 foot pass for god's sake. And most importantly can't dribble for shit. On the other hand we need a fucking stiker to bury the chances created by vini, valverde, and arda guller. Next few games start guller to give him confidence. It could be the last act of love carlo can do for this club",
