        "content": "This is a basic comparison. When breaking down teams in a low block our old team was almost perfect. Which is why we would have often 4+ goal scorelines. It was a solid structure that allow a bombardment of crosses and insurance to stop the counter. \n\nNow we only have Jude as a threat in the box, but very fast and technical players with Valverde in midifeld and Mbappe and Vini. We can no longer lean on the aerial attack, but in the building department of Benzema holding the ball and playing it through to Ronaldo and Bale stays the same. Jude will fill that role and provide that outlet to Mbappe and Vini. \n\nVini now with an actual crossing option will have to be defended more closely giving him more opportunities to be dangerous. Going down the line to cross to Jude, cutback to arda/Valverde, or to use the space in between to go for himself. The same applies to Mbappe who actually is much more efficient when shooting across goal on the right like his most recent el cl\u00e1sico goal. If Vini and Mbappe swap wings, they most certainly will create a headache for defenders. \n\nAnd when we are in dire need of a goal, that switch of Arda for Gonzalo and pairing Gonzalo and Jude in the box will work wonders. \n\nWe no longer are an aerial based team, but we have the components to spread the field and be dangerous. Xabi needs to experiment more until we have a proper structure in attack. I appreciate his usage of Masantouno/Brahim, but we have Mbappe we will perform a much better job in creating danger on that right side and Jude we will perform an even better job in being strong and protecting/blocking out the centerbacks creating space for the team to score. Lemme know what y'all think. ",

        "content": "I think that interchanging between Ancelotti-Zidane for a decade, with small breaks inbetween, has made people forget how it's like to appoint a completely NEW manager, who hasn't managed the team again or wasn't an assistant manager previously.\n\nWhen Ancelotti was brought in 2021, at that point of the season we had dropped points in 4 La Liga games in 12, not 2/12. We also lost 1-2 to Sheriff Tiraspol at home, one of the most shocking results in the history of the competition. We barely managed to get a 3-3 draw at home vs Levante, with Vini scoring in the 85th minute. We barely won 2-1 vs Valencia, with two goals after the 85th minute again. Of course, none of it mattered in the end, because we won the league and the UCL.\n\nWhen Zidane had his first full season on his 2nd tenure (19/20), we had 4D, 1L in 12 league games, even worse than 21/22 and we hadn't even faced Barcelona. In the UCL we got completely destroyed by PSG (3-0) and then drew 2-2 at home vs Club Brugge. We won La Liga too at that season btw.\n\nRight now we had lost our two toughest fixtures of the first half of the season (Atletico away, Liverpool away) and just dropped 2 points against a team that are usually tough to play against.\n\nA large part of the difficult schedule is gone. In the UCL we face a winless team away, then Man City at home, then Monaco at home and then Benfica (with 0 points right now) away. That's at least 3 wins if we play our normal football. In La Liga we've faced 5/7 teams that are 2nd-8th right now and we won 4/5 of those games. Look at our record against top 6-8 La Liga teams last season and this will put a smile on your face. ",

When Vini faced Bradley in the UCL, he just couldn\u2019t get going as Bradley anticipated almost every dribble and matched his pace, which really threw Vini off his game and halted a lot of our attacking threat. In the city vs Liverpool game, Doku stepped up against Bradley and it was a completely different fight. Doku\u2019s physicality and explosive speed were on full display; he bullied his way past Bradley with ease, absorbing contact and powering through tackles that Vini avoids due to contact. Doku didn\u2019t just rely on skill but pure athleticism, something that made Bradley look much less assured than he did against Vini. Analysing them back-to-back really made the contrast in their styles feel leagues apart.",

        "content": "Four main types of Control through playstyle \n1. Positional Control(tiki-taka), seeking to hog the ball, a DLP/Regista is an absolute must, in fact the more the merrier, false fullbacks,  ball playing cbs, etc (Prime Barca Xavi-Iniesta-Busquets, pass around till there is an opening )\n2. Spatial Control( Space Manipulation)- Not manipulating the ball, manipulating space, dragging out players subtly for through balls, opening space for others,, doesn't need the ball, A tempo manipulator is also needed to avoid predictability, but it's less about passing and more about football IQ in manipulating the football field's space, A modric type of player (Kroos-Modric-Casemiro)\n3. Territorial Control (High pressing)- Hustle, dueling football, immediate counter, absolute chaos control, a DLP is not necessarily needed, it does elevate the ceiling though(e.g Thiago Alcantra at Liverpool), but the requirements are workhoses in the middle and runners in attack for pressing and transitions.(Prime liverpool 2018-2022 that pressed everyone to dust), rotations needed to manage fatigue.\n4. Block Control - Italian football, a DLP (Pirlo) is also needed to launchpad attack and transitioning when opponents lose the ball (Prime Milan, Juve).\n\nI rank them as\n1. Spatial Manipulation- The Swiss army knife, perfect for most scenarios, though can be somewhat stale sometimes vs deep blocks(RM ucl run of 6ucls in 10 years\n2. Territorial Control- Perfect counter to positional football that requires perfection, might falter vs deep blocks without that incisiveness, Spatial battles can turn into battles of Individual brilliance (Liverpool under Klopp)\n3. Positional Control- Requires perfect execution for maximum result, best for teams that like to sit deep, but can be somewhat stale if the block stays too strong(Inter 2010 or if pressed super intensely(Pool-2019).\n4. Block Control - Prime Italian Catteneciao football, controls by denying central space, but surrenders some kind of identity, relies too much on opponents making mistakes to get counter opportunities \n\n\nOur historical sweet spot last 10 years was that Space Manipulation that didn't need the ball to control and worked like a charm in knockouts. Which kind of control mechanisms do you think this current squad should work towards pending when we get a DLP/Regista, though elite teams nowadays usually blend these control mechanisms with each other.",

        "content": "Hi there,\n\nI\u2019m from the UK and was watching some of the David Beckham documentary and I knew the \u2018galactico\u2019 period have been widely regarded as not fulfilling their potential but I didn\u2019t quite realise that DB secured a single la liga title.\n\nHowever I concede I did not watch RM week in week out as I didn\u2019t have the sports channels. So I wondered from a fans perspective what your views were of the period and team? Some of the plays from highlights feels of that time seems to show beautiful football but of course they are highlights.\n\nThank you in advance.",

        "content": "Obviously, you don\u2019t remember the time when we had to wait 12 years for a Champions League victory. With players like Zidane, Raul, Ronaldo, Robinho, Beckham, Baptista, Casillas, Ramos, Pepe, Marcelo... absolute club legends. Obviously, you don\u2019t remember how nobody believed in us in 2013/2014, that we could actually win the UCL. Obviously, you don\u2019t remember how everyone criticized Real Madrid for signing Modri\u0107, how that transfer was even labeled one of the worst in the club\u2019s history, and that the club supposedly wasted around 45 million euros on a totally average player.\n\nBut most importantly, you\u2019ve got foggy memories and don\u2019t remember how tough those matches were and how many times we had to come back from behind. Everyone acts as if Real Madrid used to step onto the pitch and completely dominate, being a class above every opponent. Which simply wasn\u2019t the case. Those were hard-fought victories, often after very poor performances, especially in the knockout stages.\n\nYou\u2019re spoiled and expect Real Madrid to crush anyone by several classes. Look at the 2021/2022 season, once again, nobody believed we could win, and in every single match we were the underdogs. Every knockout game was extremely difficult, and often we were outplayed. Same thing in 2023/2024.\n\nEveryone keeps saying we\u2019ve been playing \u201cnothing\u201d for the last few seasons, yet in those few seasons we\u2019ve won the Champions League twice and La Liga twice.\n\nWe lost 1\u20130 to Liverpool in the UCL group stage and everyone loses their minds... You\u2019re exactly the same type of people who criticized Real Madrid back in 2012: \u201cWhy is this guy playing and not that one? Why did we buy this player instead of that one? This one has to go, that one\u2019s a disappointment.\u201d Instead of proudly supporting the best team in the world, you\u2019re throwing crap at it. But history will show you were wrong.\n\nShow me a single team that has as many Champions League titles as Real Madrid. Show me a single team that has won 6 UCLs in the last 12 years. Show me a single team that has managed to defend the UCL title twice in a row under the modern knockout format. Let alone winning it three times in a row, a record that won\u2019t be broken for decades.\n\nReal Madrid has always had weaker seasons during rebuilds, and it\u2019s always proven to be just a matter of time before we ruled Europe again. Your pathetic analyses and dramatic comments like \u201cthey played absolute garbage,\u201d \u201cXabi is useless,\u201d \u201cextremely disappointed with the performance,\u201d etc., are laughable. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just this subreddit that\u2019s so toxic and spoiled and who\u2019ve only supported Real Madrid for a few years and don\u2019t know what a real crisis looks like or if this is now the standard kind of Real Madrid fan, but honestly, you should be ashamed.\n\nAm I happy with the way we play? No. But we\u2019re in a rebuilding phase, and Xabi has been coach for only few months. We\u2019re first in La Liga. We won El Cl\u00e1sico. We\u2019re the best-performing Spanish team in the UCL and quite possibly the only Spanish club that will qualify directly for the Round of 16. Yet all you can say is how terrible we play.\n\nPull your heads out of your asses and stop pretending to be professional football analysts, because you clearly have no idea what\u2019s actually going on.",
