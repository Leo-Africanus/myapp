And not giving Endrick minutes was a message to him to go on loan ASAP.\n\nThe team is fucking stacked up front. Even Gonzalo Garcia who was star of Club world cup, barely got any minutes. And Endrick was behind him in pecking order rightfully so.\n\nAlso, you guys pretending endrick is a real deal, and not mentioning to anyone that he scored that hatrick against Metz who is last in Ligue 1, and pretending that he has done something spectacular is naive and reactionary. He is showing promise, and the goals that he has scored will do him good and hopefully he continues this till the end of season. But nothing extraordinary has been done yet.\n\nAlso are you forgetting that Gonzalo Garcia scored a much better hattrick against Real Betis (much better team than Metz), for Real Fucking Madrid, and not some Lyon ?? And are you guys also ignoring the fact that Mastantuono is playing very intelligent and promising football and also working extremely hard defensively, something u can never expect Endrick to do as well ?\n\nBased on what I have seen so far, I still rate Mastantuono and Gonzalo Garcia above Endrick, and Xabi did absolutely nothing wrong.\n\nAnd in all this discussion, I have not even mentioned Brahim and Rodrygo, who deserve to start ahead of Endrick as well, especially at right wing position.",

        "content": "I think mastuono, despite his huge signing fees, is not talked enough as a youngster(mentioned signing fees because with huge fees you get more attention). For instance, he has similar or better stats than Yamal had in the first 15 games. Maybe Yamal was younger than him so we can't really compare them. Arda was the talk of football community when he signed with us, his age-18 was the highlight. Mastuono being of similar age, I don't really see him getting similar fame others before him got.\n\nAnd, I personally feel he's the proper right winger we've got since Gareth bale, a left footed right winger. Like we also had rodrygo and he was nice on the right, but him being right footed always had us lacking something during games. Mastantuono helps in so much ways, creates a balance on both sides while attacking. He runs, presses, tracks back, passes perfectly,...RUNS. Maybe he runs too much at times, but he doesn't look under confident on the pitch, and the number of fck ups are quite negligible by him.\n\nI feel like we don't talk about him enough like we did about Arda or huijsen. Or even the football media don't talk about him enough like they did with the likes of Yamal or cubarsi or pedri, etc.",

Only downside is his age (29 this summer). Tbh I think both are great choices.\n\nI'm leaning more towards Neves, just so that we have more money to spend on a top defender as well, preferably someone like Schlotterbeck, who'll cost us around 50-70 million.",

Three seasons. For a centre-back who\u2019s supposed to be a guaranteed starter at a club that plays 60+ games per year, that\u2019s simply not good enough.\n\nThe defense is always the same:\n\n\u201cWhen he\u2019s fit, Milit\u00e3o is the best centre-back in the squad.\u201d\n\nNo one argues the quality. The real question is obvious: when is he actually fit?\n\nFootball isn\u2019t played on \u201cwhen he\u2019s fit.\u201d It\u2019s played on availability, rhythm, and continuity. Real Madrid have been planning entire seasons around a \u201cmaybe this time he\u2019ll hold up.\u201d That\u2019s not squad management \u2014 that\u2019s faith.\n\nWhile waiting for the ideal Milit\u00e3o:\n\nthe defense never builds continuity\n\nconstant improvisations happen\n\nand planning becomes hostage to the medical department\n\nThe question is simple and uncomfortable:\n\n is it worth keeping a \u2018best-in-the-squad\u2019 player if he\u2019s almost never available to be that player?\n\nReal Madrid built their success on being cold and pragmatic. Lately, they seem far too romantic about potential.\n\nAdd-on:\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t just about Milit\u00e3o.\n\nAlaba: \\~38 games over the same three seasons.\n\nMendy: \\~71 games \u2014 and when he shows up, he looks like a new signing, because he disappears so often it feels like a debut every time.\n\nNow there\u2019s another name that fits the pattern: Trent Alexander-Arnold. An elite talent, no doubt \u2014 but with a recent injury history that raises the same old question: are we about to repeat the cycle?\n\nTalent without availability isn\u2019t a solution.\n\nIt\u2019s a luxury. And luxury players who don\u2019t play usually cost titles.",
