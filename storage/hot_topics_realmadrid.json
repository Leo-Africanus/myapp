        "content": "Honestly, what\u2019s the point of having a talent like Arda Guler if we don\u2019t even trust him against weaker La Liga sides? No one\u2019s saying he should start over veterans and Superstars in high stakes matches but surely he deserves a chance in games where Madrid dominates possession. If we can\u2019t give him confidence now, when will we? Keeping him benched all season will only kill his rhythm. He needs game time to adapt, not just five-minute cameos. The club needs to show some faith in him.How else will he ever be ready for bigger games? This hesitation makes no sense at all.\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating because we\u2019ve seen this story before\u2014young talents wasting away on the bench instead of getting the small exposure they need. Arda has the skill, the vision, the flair everything Madrid fans love to see. Yet, instead of nurturing him, we\u2019re acting like he\u2019s not ready for even mid-table La Liga teams. What\u2019s the worst that could happen? He struggles a bit? That\u2019s part of development Instead, we\u2019re killing his confidence before he even gets a real chance. If the club keeps this up, they will  blame themselves when he thrives elsewhere and we\u2019re left wondering why.\n",
