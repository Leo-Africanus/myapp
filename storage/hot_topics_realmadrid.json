        "content": "There\u2019s a reason Perez put a 1B buy clause on him. During last injury prone season, he stepped up and delivered as the CB at interim. Big games and league games, fantastic performances and passion in excess\u2026 Despite the questionable performance in the CWC, the potential of Raul is enormous. Everyone seems to have shoved him under the rug after the two bad games. I honestly believe he could become a Ramos type defender for Madrid with enough finetuning and training + experience. He\u2019ll probably serve as a sub for Militao or Huijsen\u2026. Although Xabi is really flexible and determines lineups tailored to opponents so maybe in 3CB\u2019s we\u2019ll see him play and Tchoua back in supportive midfield role. If he gets the playtime he needs and is able to be more careful we\u2019re in for a treat.",

        "content": "The Supreme Court has upheld the ruling handed down by Madrid\u2019s Court of First Instance No. 42 on October 6, 2022, which convicted the El Confidencial newspaper and its editor, Ignacio Cardero, for unlawfully intruding upon the honour of Real Madrid president Florentino P\u00e9rez.                                   \n\n\nOver a period of several days during July 2021, El Confidencial published a series of audio recordings from a private conversation involving the Real Madrid president, recorded without his consent. In his ruling, the judge stated that \u201cthe form and content of the broadcasts show that the intent was always to undermine Mr. Florentino P\u00e9rez Rodr\u00edguez's public image. As such, this constitutes an unlawful intrusion upon his right to honour.\u201d",

He doesn't run well; he constantly has to run back to retrieve passes, his ball play is erratic, he's losing speed, and so on.\n\nAnd it feels as if I am the only one who notices and cares. \n\n300 characters: I just don't want fans to be surprised if we lose a big match because of it; he isn't the same Rudiger from 2 years ago.",

Keepers become prime Neuer and save everything, but the opposition does not seem to wanna win games.\n\nIs it just me who feels that way? I just hope to see small clubs challenge the title at least once this season..",

He was fast, he was a good dribbler and his free kicks were top class plus he was the most expensive player at that time when we signed him\n\nSo I had lots of high expectations from him which, ofc bale proved me right, he settled well in real Madrid and linked up really well with Karim and Cristiano. \n\nI love his technical skills and dribbling and his amazing finesse goals and he was also a major part of our team for many years especially when we did 3 UCLs in a row \n\nSo overall my expectations were high and he did delivered and became important part of the squad",
