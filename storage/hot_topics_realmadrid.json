I know he's quite young and still has a long way to go to become the best in the game, but considering his age, the way he plays, his passion, hunger, and madness, he's already showing leadership qualities reminiscent of our own Sergio Ramos.\n\nLast night, he played his part perfectly, never looking out of place and remaining composed throughout the game. That 'get up' moment when he channeled his inner Sergio Ramos, I was beyond happy to see that we might have another player with a similar personality and talent.\n\nAsencio is not only talented but also has great potential. He's excellent on the ball, incredibly fast, and can defend with both his front and back foot. Especially, His pace is insane, and I'm sure the more he plays, the better he'll become.\n\nFor now, he should be our undisputed starter. The positive takeaways from the game for me were Raul Asencio and Rodrygo's consistent good performances lately.\n\nI hope Madrid takes care of this young talent and helps him develop to his full potential. If they do, we might just see another Sergio Ramos emerge!",

The fact that he successfully slide tackles multiple times a game alone is enough for my vote. Give him the #4. ",
