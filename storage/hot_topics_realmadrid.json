        "content": "The much needed la d\u00e9cima and with him and Bale we finally got it. And then he kept that defense winning even when we lost Pepe, Ramos, and then Varane. Even when we were in injury trouble, he stepped in playing centerback even in a Madrid derby where we ended up winning the double back in 23/24 with the champions league final goal coming from his head proof of how he kept that Madrid spirit alive that we saw back with Ramos scoring the header in la decima. \n\nAnd at a national level even after countless injuries and missed chances to play for the Spanish national team, and when he finally had the chance, he showed up and led a young Spanish side to win the euros, putting a tremendous effort to cover for lamine yamal on defense, something that was greatly missed as demonstrated by Nuno Mendes in the nations league. \n\nBut what makes him a true captain is his attitude off the field. Not afraid of disapproving of corrupt politicians in the public's eye, speaking against UEFA and fifa for the horrendous calendar, and recently speaking against Tebas and the ridiculous Miami game plan. \n\nYou just can't ask for a better captain to lead this young dressing room. Hopefully he overcomes the difficulty of the acl injury which has weakend his thigh leading to his current injury, but if any Madrid player has consistently come back and proved why he is the main man in his position, it is him. \n\nHopefully Trent gets some good tips from him during their recovery, I mean look at the fantastic influence Carvajal has had on Valverde and even past youngsters like Hakimi showing his respects to his time with him. Always important to pass on the knowledge from past generations and Madrid is the king in that regard. ",

Apart from my club, I\u2019ve also followed Liverpool and, because of my father, had a soft spot for Bar\u00e7a for as long as I can remember. But things started to change when Arda G\u00fcler joined Real Madrid.\n\nAt first, when Arda moved to Fenerbah\u00e7e(our rival) which made me pretty upset. It felt like we\u2019d lost this incredible wonderkid, who has possibility to became the kind of classic number 10 you don\u2019t see much anymore. Still, I love football and I was happy to see such talent would represent our national team.\n\nBut then my man made the move to Real Madrid. Again, it made me a bit sad at first, another \u201crival\u201d team, in a way, but I couldn\u2019t help following him. Since he arrived, I haven\u2019t missed any of his minutes and watched most Real Madrid games over the last two years, always hoping to see him subbed on.\n\nSomewhere along the way, things changed. After Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s goal yesterday, I realized I was actually celebrating like a true Madrid fan. And when I think back to this year\u2019s El Cl\u00e1sico, I was genuinely upset after the loss.\n\nSo I guess it\u2019s official, after being a Gala fan, I can proudly say I\u2019ve become a Madridista. \ud83e\udd0d",
