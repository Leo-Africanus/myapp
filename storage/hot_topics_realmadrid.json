        "title": "Mbapp\u00e9 \"I like to say that fans are lucky to just come and enjoy a show without knowing what happens behind the scenes. Honestly, if I didn't have this passion, the world of football would have disgusted me a long time ago. I would never advise my child to step foot in the football world.\"",
        "content": "On the rape allegations last year\n\n\"I wasn't even concerned. It was just sad to see everyone jumping on it like it was a steak, on such a serious subject. It happens to far too many women, unfortunately, for us to jump on it for headlines and articles. No one took the time to ask what happened to the potential victim. And when everyone saw that I wasn't in this story, what happened? She's in the gutter, no one knows where she is, we don't care. It's a sensitive subject and it made me sad. I knew I was going to get back up because I wasn't involved, the police never called me, my name was never mentioned.\"\n\n\"I knew from the start that it would be okay, but it's complicated. Especially for those close to you, even more so for women. Whether you like it or not, you feel that in the other person's eyes, the person is thinking: 'What if there was a 1% chance that he did something?' It hurt me. I have nothing to do with it... These are human reactions from the women around me, because there are too many who go through this. I just had to accept it, keep quiet, go to training. Sometimes you see comments... But you accept it. Carlo (Ancelotti) told me it was unfair. I said to him: 'What should I do other than let it go and score goals?'\"\n\nOn the legal dispute with PSG\n\n\"It's my responsibility by right, it's labor law. The procedure gave the impression that I wanted to harm PSG. I signed an employment contract. I just wanted to be paid. I have nothing against PSG, I love this club, I have friends there. But it's the only way to get what I'm owed, something I've earned with my sweat. Whether you like it or not, it's still a job. But I already knew I wasn't getting paid when I was at PSG. When the money doesn't come in, you see it. I could have caused a scandal while I was there, but I told myself it wasn't worth it. But when you see that you're not being paid, after a while, you have to react. Only you quickly come across as the ex who's angry... If it could have been settled in an office, this story would never have existed.\"\n\nOn Cristiano Ronaldo's quote that he could only trust four people with his eyes closed\n\n\"I understand. 'Why is he telling me that? What does he want from me? What does he expect from me?' There are a lot of 'whys'. The line between being careful and being paranoid is very thin. You can come across as crazy. How many times have I heard people talk about a player and say: 'He's crazy!' No, he's paranoid because there are only crazy people around him. Maybe he met a beautiful person there, but he's just had 20 meetings with crazy people, so he has doubts, and that's normal.\"\n\nOn the mental exhaustion for players\n\n\"The complexity of the thing is that people have trouble with it. You must not show it. Someone in his living room would say, 'Fuck, at the price they're paying you, I'd be happy every day!' That's why sometimes it's better to keep it to yourself. If I win the World Cup, you come to me three days later and ask me about it, I can say it. You're practically untouchable there. You lose a match, you say that, they tell you that you're saying that because you were terrible. It doesn't change anything if I was already like that before the match... It's all a question of timing.\"",

        "content": "Good day Madrid fans! My son is a die hard Real Madrid fan since birth \ud83d\ude05 his birthday is coming soon and i want to gift him an experience he will never forget rather than material things. I am a casual football fan but lately finding myself watching RMA matches with my son and we enjoy it. I am looking to take him to October 4 match against Villareal. So my question is, is this a big match? The reason i am asking this because i logged into Entradas.com and i can still find very good seats with reasonable price for UCL match against Olympique de Marseille. Is there a big chance that tickets would be still available 1 week before the VillaReal match? I was looking for tickets via 3rd party sites and they cost double for worse seats. Anyone who is experienced watching RMA live at Bernabeu? Thank you so much in advance!\n\nEdit: i would love to bring him to el classico but our vacation from work start on October 1. Would it be easier to get tickets for Villareal match contra UCL matches?",

        "content": "Hola Madridistas \ud83d\udc4b\n\nSorry if this deviates a bit from the usual posts here, but I thought some of you might find it interesting. My grandad recently gave me his collection of old matchday programmes from the 1960s and early 70s (he\u2019s a Chelsea supporter), and among them is this gem from a 1966 friendly between Real Madrid and Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.\n\nThe programme includes the starting lineups, notes about the players, and a fascinating snapshot of the Spanish league and Real Madrid at the time. It\u2019s such a cool time capsule of football history, and I figured some of you would appreciate seeing it. Some absolute legends from Madrid made appearances in this game including: Pirri (561 La liga matches, 172 goals, and ten La liga trophies), Amancio (9 La liga titles, later became honorary president of RM), Gento (The only player to win 6 European cups, and was voted as the greatest Spanish player of the 20th century), Zoco (12 seasons at RM, 7 La liga titles). Puskas also attended at the match and it says he was \u201cincluded for possible penalty selection\u201d. Unsure if he actually took one.\n\nTwo other interesting things to note is Zaragoza is spelt \u2018Saragossa\u2019 (unsure if this is the English spelling of the name) and Bar\u00e7a was still called CF Barcelona and not FC Barcelona as it is known today (not sure why).\n\n\u00a1Gracias, y Que tenga un buen d\u00eda!",

        "content": "Why are there endless posts about Rodrygo, claiming that Real Madrid or Xabi is stealing his spot in the starting lineup? He's just like any other Real Madrid player who either starts or comes off the bench. Why would he receive any privilege over any other player? Last year, he played almost all of the matches for almost 90 minutes because he was Ancelotti's favorite, while others, like Arda, rotted on the bench no matter what they did. No matter how many chances they got, they failed to deliver.\n\nI don't understand the point of sharing a match from three years ago or posting a carousel of his images and acting like we should be ashamed that he's not a starter. If Xabi thinks he performs better in his position, he'll play; otherwise, he'll sit on the bench like the other players. Many talented players have come and gone from RM, but I've never seen one defended this heavily, even though he's not half as good as Ronaldo.",
