This guy has been horrible since december and is barely offering anything to the team. Some people will try to gaslight me and say he\u2018s upped his game a bit since the cwc and while that is true\u2026the bar is in HELL. Like this is the number 7 for real madrid were talking about here. Those were average games at best. Nothing special and I won\u2018t be convinced otherwise. He did a successful step over against Juve and everyone celebrated it like it wasn\u2019t a completely normal thing for him a year ago. He\u2018s literally been playing like garnacho or fkn sterling. His touch is terrible, he makes too many mistakes and he literally can\u2018t beat his man on anymore?? I know I will get flamed for this and it hurts me to say this but it\u2019s true, he\u2019s not even top 10 wingers in the world.He\u2018s pressing a bit more and making simple passes now and is getting celebrated for it man like what are we doing. Give rodrygo a chance at lw and I promise he\u2018s going to be better or atleast on the same level. 100%. Vini looks like he\u2018s gained some muscle mass, he doesn\u2018t look as quick as he used to and its affecting heavily. Whatever, I dont think we should condone his bad performances any longer",

        "content": "After that roller coaster of the game against Borussia Dortmund, I was on my way back home. I wasn\u2019t paying attention to the map and I missed a turn to enter the I-95 highway. I was really annoyed because that meant I had to pass the stadium and deal with the stadium traffic. Little did I know that it was the best thing that had happened. Right at the second entrance to I-95, I noticed that the entrance was blocked off temporarily by a police car. I knew right away that could only mean one thing\u2026..",

The extra time was so chaotic how did they even score the second goal smh. Anyway, the last save from courtois was pure class and proves why he's the best goalkeeper in the world.",
