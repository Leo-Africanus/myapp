The team is dominating the play however and just needs more determination in the 2nd half to be able to win this match\n\n46' - 2nd half underway\n\n58' - Borja Alonso hits the crossbar with a volley after a cross from Yusi following a series of set pieces.. Best chance for Castilla so far\n\n\u26bd 62' - GOLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - Castilla push for the goal high up the field and have throw in on the left near the box - Yusi whips in a cross and Gonzalo connects with it, like always, with impeccable timing and placement to head it past the keeper! He now has 20 goals this season, no player ever scored more in a regular season in Primera Federaci\u00f3n, and there's still 15 matches to go! \n\n\ud83d\udd04 75' - Campos and Edgar on for Pol Fortuny and Borja Alonso \n\n80' - penalty for Castilla after a pull on Gonzalo in the box! \n\n\u26bd 82' - GOLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - Gonzalo steps up and obviously converts, he's now the lone record goal scorer in a single regular season of Primera Federaci\u00f3n, with 15 (!!!) matchdays to go! \n\n\ud83d\udd04 84' - Aguado and Antonio on for Yusi and Manuel \u00c1ngel \n\n\ud83d\udd04 90' - Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga makes his comeback after a lengthy injury, he comes on for V\u00edctor - slowly but surely, all the injured players are coming back\n\nFT - Another great performance and another win for Castilla, that makes 4 out of 5 in 2025 so far - the team is now 7th, pushing for the playoff spots, despite being in the relegation zone for basically the entirety of the first half of the season - all the injured players returning have made a gigantic difference and Ra\u00fal's team is suddenly the most in form team of the division in 2025 so far! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 17:30 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee**: \n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 2, Matchday 23\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[FEF TV](https://feftv.com) (subscription - 12.99\u20ac/month)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-2-3-1): Mario de, Luis - Youssef Enr\u00edquez \u2018Yusi\u2019 (84' Diego Aguado), Mario Rivas, Quique Ribes, David Jim\u00e9nez - Jos\u00e9 Maria Andr\u00e9s \u2018Chema\u2019, Manuel \u00c1ngel (84' Antonio David) - Borja Alonso (74' Edgar Pujol), Pol Fortuny (75' Andr\u00e9s Campos), V\u00edctor Mu\u00f1oz (90' Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga) - Gonzalo Garc\u00eda \n\nBench: Fran Gonz\u00e1lez (GK), David Ruiz, Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez. \n\nUnavailable: Ra\u00fal Asencio (first team call-up), David Cuenca (pubalgia), Jacobo Ram\u00f3n (first team call-up), Loren Aguado (first team call-up), C\u00e9sar Palacios (ACL tear), Jeremy de Le\u00f3n (ankle injury). \n\nCoach: Ra\u00fal\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** LWWDW\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 11th | 29pt | 7-6-7 | 38:26\n ",

I know he's quite young and still has a long way to go to become the best in the game, but considering his age, the way he plays, his passion, hunger, and madness, he's already showing leadership qualities reminiscent of our own Sergio Ramos.\n\nLast night, he played his part perfectly, never looking out of place and remaining composed throughout the game. That 'get up' moment when he channeled his inner Sergio Ramos, I was beyond happy to see that we might have another player with a similar personality and talent.\n\nAsencio is not only talented but also has great potential. He's excellent on the ball, incredibly fast, and can defend with both his front and back foot. Especially, His pace is insane, and I'm sure the more he plays, the better he'll become.\n\nFor now, he should be our undisputed starter. The positive takeaways from the game for me were Raul Asencio and Rodrygo's consistent good performances lately.\n\nI hope Madrid takes care of this young talent and helps him develop to his full potential. If they do, we might just see another Sergio Ramos emerge!",
