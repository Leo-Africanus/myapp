Some heavy rotation by L\u00f3pez de Lerma, as Juvenil A are already mathematically qualified for the next round as one of the top 6 teams\n\n\u26bd 23' - Goal for Man City - they have a free kick right at the edge of the box, and Gray scores a curler into the goalkeeper's corner where Illia is sadly nowhere to be seen\n\n37' - penalty for Juvenil A! Liberto intercepts a failed backpass, and the keeper arrives late and brings him do\n\n41' - absolutely terrible penalty by Liberto, who shoots it low, weak, slightly off centre and the keeper has no trouble saving it... \n\nHT - not a good first half by Juvenil A, who can't take as much control of the game as usual with the lack of experience on the pitch - still the difference between the two teams is marginal, with City converting a free kick while Liberto missed the bigger chance from a penalty\n\n\ud83d\udd04 46' - 2nd half underway, Espinosa and Jacobo on for Lezcano and Liberto\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 16:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee:** Joonas Jaanovits (EST) \n\n**Competition:** UEFA Youth League, League Phase, Matchday 6\n\n**Viewing options:** [RMTV/RM PLAY](https://play.realmadrid.com/home)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Juvenil A XI (4-3-3):** Illia Voloshyn - \u00c1lvaro Lezcano (46' Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds S\u00e1ez Espinosa), Leo Lemaitre, Matteo Garrido, Jes\u00fas Fortea - Izan Regueira, Ignacio Gasc\u00f3n, Diego Lacosta - Liberto Navascu\u00e9s (46' Jacobo Ortega), Enzo Alves, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes \n\nBench: Javi Navarro (GK), Ferr\u00e1n Seco, Hugo de Almeida, Diego Mart\u00ednez \u2018Beto\u2019, Rub\u00e9n L\u00f3pez, Rub\u00e9n Mart\u00ednez. \n\nCoach: Juli\u00e1n L\u00f3pez de Lerma\n",

        "title": "Why this is happening only in our club? Real Madrid might be the biggest in the world but there are other big clubs in Europe. None of them has this much dressing room issues.",
        "content": "We are a big club with big superstars but that doesn't mean ALL the players playing in other clubs are below our players. There are a lot good players in other clubs as well and no one is causing this much problems in the dressing room.\n\n - We all know Harry Kane is a best striker right now in Bundesliga chasing records and Kompany benched him for few matches especially against Leverkusen where he played completely with the B team. Still no one protested against him or caused problems in dressing room.\n\n - I hope you all remember how Pep subbed out Haaland at UCL after scoring 5 goals(Some say that he didn't want Haaland to break Messi's record which probably might be true as Pep is a biggest admirer of Messi). Haaland didn't even show any sadness. He just whispered in Pep's ears and went to the bench.\n\n - There are a lot of occasions where Kevin De Bruyne is subbed off while carrying the team and Pep didn't hesitate to take him out for tactical purposes. He also made Grealish and Foden play out of positions and they didn't cause any trouble.\n\n- Joao Cancelo voiced his dissatisfaction against Pep and the club immediately sent him on loan and eventually sold him.\n\n- Rashford, Garnacho doesn't work well with Ruben Amorim and Amorim didn't hesitate to be strict with them despite them being well admired players in the club. Now Kobbie Mainoo also voicing his dissatisfaction but Amorim isn't even flinching a bit always making sure the dressing room is not messed up by the likes of these players. Even Senior players like Bruno and Casemiro (Former Real Madrid player for your kind reminder) follows Amorim's instructions properly and gives their best.\n\n- Most recently Salah voiced against Slot and the club immediately backed Slot by not including him in the squad. Salah has done a lot for Liverpool than Vini did under Benzema, Modric, Kroos' mercy. \n\nWith things going well in all these clubs, why our club alone is like this? Our new system is not yet stabilized and the players already causing problems suppressing our growth further. When Cancelo voiced against the manager, club backed the manager. When Salah voiced against the manager, the club backed the manager. Buy why our club alone is like this? We have a team with lot of good players. With the calibre of our team, even our bench players can step in and destroy opponents at any time just like how Bayern does in Bundesliga, if not even better. But this useless ego and undeservingly snatching the starting positions of other deserving players simply harmed the rhythm. Xabi's system is a mixture of both possession and counter press. Both are not easy to master overnight. Without even letting the system settle, how can we sack the manager? Things were good when Bellingham was injured because Arda was the only option of creating chances from number 10 position giving high quality assists. Now Bellingham snatched that position simply for him to score. Nothing else. See how much influence he is having in the dressing room. That simply explains why Carlo couldn't use Arda the entire last season.\n\nXabi's control on the dressing room was good enough at the beginning of the season. You cannot say Mbappe didn't drop deep to create chances. You cannot say Mbappe didn't initiate and involve in the high press of Xabi's system. He did that well and I was personally surprised considering how selfish he was at PSG. Even Vini followed Xabi's instructions at the start. Mbappe's goal against Sociedad was due to Vini's pressing forcing mistake which Mbappe capitalised. When everything was going well, Vini was the one who started all these f*cking rant and the club f*cking backed him despite not apologizing to the manager. After all he had done, he is starting the very next match. No other club does this.\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\n\nEven at Barcelona, when Rashford arrived late at practice, Flick immediately benched him. All these things happen at other clubs because the club backs the manager be it Manchester United (Which had a history of never backing managers), Barcelona, Manchester City, Bayern Munich etc. But our club alone worships the players and not supporting the manager despite him being our club legend and dethroned the dominance of Bayern in Bundesliga.\n\nI really wish the club should step in and back the manager only then these players will realise that ego won't work anymore. Otherwise, these players will have the mentality that they can control any manager they get. Its a critical moment for the club otherwise we're doomed. The players and the manager working together properly will simply solve most of our problems. Its frustrating that such a simple thing is not happening in our club.\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22",

        "content": "\nHonestly, I\u2019m tired of seeing vini fc  act like Vin\u00edcius is some untouchable superstar this season. The guy has talent, no doubt, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s been putting in 100% on the pitch. Too often he looks like he\u2019s coasting or waiting for moments to happen instead of making them happen.\nThere are games where defenders barely need to challenge him because he isn\u2019t pressing, tracking back, or even running full out in transitions. He can disappear from big moments, leaving the team short-handed when the attack stalls. You can literally see the difference when he\u2019s switched on  he\u2019s explosive, he can take over a game  but that doesn\u2019t happen consistently anymore.\n\nPart of it is probably confidence or mental fatigue, but at this level, talent alone isn\u2019t enough. Real Madrid needs wingers who fight for every ball, press, and run at defenders relentlessly. Vini\u2019s inconsistency on effort costs the team more than his occasional flashes of brilliance make up for.\n\nEven against weaker teams, he seems to conserve energy or drift into easy zones instead of challenging defenders or creating chances. Compare that to players like Mbapp\u00e9 or Vin\u00edcius in past seasons  you don\u2019t see them \u201cswitching off\u201d as often. At this point, it feels like Madrid can\u2019t rely on him to consistently lift the team.\n\nI\u2019m not saying he should be written off , he\u2019s still a top-level talent. But if he doesn\u2019t start giving every match his all, people will be right to question if he\u2019s truly committed to helping the team win consistently. Talent alone won\u2019t carry Madrid; effort does, and right now, Vini isn\u2019t showing it enough.\n\n",

        "content": "Can we talk about the \u201cWales. Golf. Madrid\u201d flag?\n\nThat slogan is the one thing I felt hard done by. For one thing, no one knew how much golf I actually played. If I ask you now how much golf you reckon I played, you\u2019d probably say three or four times a week maybe, something along those lines?\n\nRoughly, yep.\n\nI played once every two to three weeks, but only on a day off. I'd never play a game for eight hours, I was always very professional about it. But people don't know that so they make up that slogan.\n\nDo you recount the Wales game against Hungary in November 2019 where the incident with the flag happened that would go on to incense the Spanish media?\n\nWe\u2019d just qualified for the Euros so I'm obviously celebrating, the whole team's there, then someone puts the flag [with the slogan] in front of me. What am I supposed to do? I'm like, I can't throw my own country's flag on the floor because that is the worst thing I could do. I actually didn't physically ever touch the flag, which for me was important because I was like, it's not me doing this \u2013 I'm just celebrating with my friends. Then what happened happened.\n\nThings got pretty ugly.\n\nI got absolutely slaughtered [by the Spanish media]. I felt a bit hard done by because it all comes down to misinformation. I obviously don't prioritise golf more than I do my country and my club and physically haven't done one thing wrong. I look back at it now and it's like, it is what it is. I can't do anything about it. You have to laugh or you cry. So I laughed.\n\nDid you ever cry about it?\n\nNo. If people were ever against me, I would run on, smile and laugh. That was my way of coping with it. I either get angry and I play well or I enjoy and smile and laugh about it and play well. I didn't want to show any weakness and be upset.\n\nAre you surprised by how well you were able to play despite what was going on?\n\nI still remember that game I came on for the last 30 minutes [against Real Sociedad at the Bernab\u00e9u four days later], I was getting fully whistled, then by the end I was getting applauded. I played so well. In the car driving home, my agent called me and he was like, you are literally insane. No one can deal with that type of pressure and come on and do those things \u2013 you're just weird. And I'm like, well luckily I'm mentally strong. If other people were in my situation, I'm not sure they would've coped.\n\nWhat would you put that down to?\n\nMy dad is very strong. The way he and my mum brought me up was like \u201cno bullshit\u201d. They sacrificed a lot when I was growing up, travelling and giving up their weekends. It\u2019s something I only understand now I\u2019m a parent doing it with my son. But if I went to a game and I didn't try, Dad was like, you can play shit. I don't care. You can play amazing. I don't care. But if you don't try, that's not acceptable. I say it to my son now, he is only seven but trying is the only thing I require from you. It teaches you a lifelong lesson. You can't just give up when you don't like it or things aren't going well.\n\nEven when you\u2019re being vilified?\n\nI've always said with journalism, if they could only write about facts then it would change the game. But some people just write what they want and ultimately you've got a reader, so why wouldn't they believe it? There should be a responsibility on them that they only write the truth.\n\nI\u2019m a journalist and I\u2019ve got a truth for you: are you OK that I'm on the green and you're not?\n\nYeah, I am. Facts. That\u2019s a cold, hard fact.",

Everything that happened last season was their fault and they used Carlo as the scapegoat, and now they\u2019re doing the same to xabi. Perez and co hide behind the managers when they make mistakes because it\u2019s easier to put the blame on one person instead of the whole institution. We could have salvaged last season by getting defenders instead of just mbappe and endrick alone, but what happened, we ran Rudiger to the ground and now he\u2019s injury prone. We came close to so many trophies but the lack of reaction by the board has cost us time and time again, and then giving these spoilt brats power over the manager is just a disgrace.

He has recently become a political figure, attempting to win over the dressing room by offering concessions: shorter video sessions, untouchable stars, more days off, fewer tactical obligations",
        "content": "In these 6 months of the Alonso era, the Real Madrid dressing room has not meshed well with him. He arrived to raise the bar, both in training and matches; to impose discipline and order in a dressing room that was spoiled and toxic; and to modernize the team's style of play. As the weeks went by, the players grew increasingly frustrated with his tactical demands, high press, advanced defensive line, endless video sessions, and limited rest days. And Alonso, knowing he was losing the dressing room, gradually gave in, eventually offering them his full support, his arm, and whatever else they asked for.\n\nThe latest example is recent. The before and after the victory at San Mam\u00e9s demonstrates the power of the dressing room. Traveling on Tuesday instead of Wednesday angered a good number of the players, and\u00a0after the win against Athletic, Alonso granted them two days off, when only one had been planned. So the preparation for the match against Celta included only one training session, on Saturday. This is just one example of the many that have occurred since the Vinicius case erupted.\n\nUntil then, Alonso didn't really know what it meant to coach Real Madrid. And that's despite being a player for five years, and having witnessed how a coach like Mourinho lost the support of a large majority of his players when things started to go wrong. Now Alonso himself is experiencing firsthand the influence players have at Real Madrid, but he doesn't understand why he was brought in if, at the first sign of trouble, the club looked the other way, as happened with Vinicius. That's when Xabi understood that he had to manage 25 egos and put his coaching role aside. The beginning of the end.\n\nAlonso believed that coaching on his knees would boost the dressing room, but usually, it's quite the opposite. Everything that has happened in recent weeks has paved the way for what seems imminent: his dismissal.",

I was hoping the club to put pressure on the players but it seems that they are not willing to face the actual problem with this team.\n\nVini should have been punished after his tantrum in El Classico. Just look at Liverpool, they removed one of their greatest players ever from the squad list because he acted out against the manager.\n\nThe player issue is bigger than the manager issue. We have a player problem, without that getting fixed not even Klopp can do anything with this squad.\n\nFor once this club should not cave into the players and have their manager's back. Its been 2 years in a row where we clearly have player problems.\n\nWe need to learn from other clubs, otherwise we will be constantly changing managers because we are not fixing the real problem instead...",

Aside from their ridiculous high line and aggressive press.. their attacking strategy is worth noting.\n\nA few things I noticed\n\n1 - RB and LB overlapping and underlapping runs (mostly RB Kounde)\n\nKounde and yamal connection is amazing.. kounde received so many passes that led to dangerous balls towards the middle of the box. Valverde is perfect for this. \n\n2 - raphinha free roaming.. playing a lot off the ball that created lots of space for balde and fermin towards the left and center. \n\n3 - constant box presence in the form of lewandowski and raphinha\n\n\nIn CWC RM utilized Fran and Trent pretty good. Wondering what changed Carreras can also be that attacking threat but the problem I see is vini hogging the ball and not passing for those lapping runs. Hopefully xabi points this out to the team. \n",

        "title": "Blaming Mbappe, Vini, or Alonso Won't solve the problems. It's a collective issue.",
        "content": "For many years, I've tuned into Madrid games. For many years, you could tell that Madrid's young players weren't ready to take over. One of my mates used to say, \"Watch what will happen when the senior guys leave, can these Madrid youngsters do it when they don't have those players to hold their hands?\"\n\nAnd well, we're seeing that now, your players are just not mature enough because they were never asked to be mature.\n\nReal Madrid is an unbalanced squad. The profiles are correct, but the players need a reality check on where they need to be for the team to excel. They need to understand that the team is better than the individual. \n\nLet's break it down:\n\nVini and Mbappe CAN PLAY TOGETHER. The notion that two absolute world-class players best in their positions can't play together is just rubbish. The notion that Vini is selfish and Mbappe is selfish is again rubbish. These are Twitter takes and haters just spewing nonsense. \n\nThe problem that Vini and Mbappe have is that Madrid's Midfield and shape are counter-productive. \n\n Yes, both players like to occupy the left wing and left half space, but we also know that both players are intelligent enough and have good movement to know how to rotate and be in the best possible space, and they have shown multiple times this year that it can work. \n\n  \nMadrid's problem really lies in the fact that your midfield doesn't have a fucking clue. \n\nBellingham is not a 10. Let's just state this. He is not a 10. And the sooner Bellingham accepts this, Xabi accepts this, you won't see much improvement. Bellingham is a box-to-box midfielder and should be employed as such. \n\n  \nThe reason why you don't want Bellingham in the 10 position is because of the attackers that you have. What Madrid needs for 10 is a pure playmaker, your Ozil, Di Maria, Odegard, Guler, Nico Paz. \n\nYou need a pure playmaking 10 here because you have players that are very good off-ball and are very good with receiving the ball at their feet or into space. \n\nBellingham is great in a lot of areas, but his strengths would be best utilized deeper to help progress the ball forward, laying it off to the #10 or distributing it out wide for one of the wingers to drive it forward. \n\nHe can then crash the box to get on cutbacks or crosses, or be the man from deep to break the low block with a deeper unmark runs. \n\nA Bellingham, Tchouameni Pivot could work. \n\n  \nStop Icing Rodrygo. It's simple as that, in every attack especially Madrids, you need that selfless player that will run and run and keep on going. Rodrygo provided that in previous years and he is more than good enough todo so. Now the player might feel disrespected and might feel that the club doesn't care about him but i sincerely believe, that an attack of Vini Mbappe Rodrygo can work and should be working. \n\n  \nYes you do need fullbacks and defenders and maybe adding some more creative midfield players, but your squad has the right profiles and player types to be successful. \n\nVini's head is all about his contract at this point, Rodrygo has one and half foot out the door. \n\nBellingham is in no mans land at this point, even his england spot isn't secure. \n\nBut the noise, the internal distractions, the noise from the outside. Too much non-footballing nonsense is happening at Madrid. \n\n",
