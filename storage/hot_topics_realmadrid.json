        "content": "okay so here's a few things that need to happen for us to finish in the top 8 and avoid round of 32 in the CL\n\n\n1.we must finish with a better goal balance than Dortmund, Bayern, Juventus and Celtic who also have 12 points. currently Dortmund are +8, Bayern are +6 and we are +5 so it's technically not impossible, but Bayern are playing Slovan in the last fixture who sit at 0 points and -18 GD so it's gonna be pretty hard\n\n2.Lille-Feyenoord must end in a draw since both teams have 1 more point than us\n\n3.Barca must beat Atalanta and Inter must not lose to monaco, both of these are pretty probable\n\n4.if all of the above happens, we'll have overtaken Dortmund, Bayern, Brest, Lile, Feyenoord, Monaco and Atalanta which would put us at the 9th place :D so we need to overtake one more team, there are a few ways that could happen -\n\na.Salzburg to win vs Atletico\n\nb.Zagreb to win vs Milan\n\nc.Sparta do not lose vs Leverkusen\n\nd.Celtic do not lose vs Aston Villa (probably our best bet? :D)\n\n\nsafe to say, the chances are extremely slim\n\n\np.s. let me know if i missed anything, but i think i got it all?",
