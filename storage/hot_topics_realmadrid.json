Not only has he been resilient defensively, he's shown that he ia able to move the ball forward which is necessary in today's football. I hope that Alaba/Militao/Tchou coming back won't push him to the bench because he has shown that he deserves a chance. I also hope this motivates the coaching staff to be more open to trying talents from the younger team, the squad has been ravaged by injuries so this is the time to take a chance on these guys.",

        "title": "Biggest fumble of the decade to not get Kane or Haaland instead of Mbappe. Flo has a lot to answer for only choosing Mbappe.",
        "content": "The situation I am describing highlights one of the potential pitfalls of investing heavily in a single player like Mbapp\u00e9. While his talent is undeniable, football is a team sport, and a player\u2019s work ethic and tactical fit often matter as much as their individual brilliance. If Mbapp\u00e9 isn\u2019t pulling his weight defensively or contributing to the team\u2019s pressing game, it puts a massive burden on his teammates, especially in high-stakes matches where defensive organization is critical.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that his performances are suffering from a lack of adaptation to the team\u2019s tactical setup. Some players thrive when their team is built around them, but others struggle when they\u2019re required to fit into a pre-existing system. If Mbapp\u00e9 isn\u2019t delivering consistently\u2014whether due to effort, a mismatch in tactical expectations, or issues with team chemistry\u2014it makes the heavy investment in him seem less justifiable, especially if the club sacrificed depth or other key areas to fund his arrival.\n\nAs for his lack of clinical finishing, that\u2019s a concern for any top-tier striker. It\u2019s not just about the goals he scores but also the chances he creates or misses that could turn the tide of a game. Players like Erling Haaland and Robert Lewandowski, for example, are often praised for their ability to stay involved in the game even when their team struggles to dominate. Mbapp\u00e9, on the other hand, risks falling into the trap of becoming a passenger when things aren\u2019t going well.\n\nIt\u2019s still early, as I mentioned, and players do need time to settle into new clubs and systems. However, fans and analysts will naturally expect a player of Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s caliber and cost to make an immediate and consistent impact. If he continues to struggle, the pressure will only intensify, and the decision to build a team around him might start to look like a gamble that didn\u2019t pay off.",

        "content": "It's been a long time since I've seen this sub flooded with reactionary takes about a certain player. Yeah, I want to talk about Kylian Mbappe. I would have never imagined our fans calling him \"washed\", \"finished\" or a \"waste of money\". It's actually shocking how quickly the narrative has changed for a player who, just a few months ago, was welcomed with open arms from almost the entire Real Madrid fanbase. \n\nLet's not rewrite history. Every single Real Madrid fan was ecstatic when Mbappe finally joined this summer. The transfer saga may have been long and painful but the excitement when it was complete was still there. Why? Because deep down, we all know he is one of the best players of his generation, someone who has already proven his talent. \n\nBut the real problem lied in the fact that we already had arguably the best player of the last 2-3 years operating in the same area as Kylian Mbappe. Integrating these two into the same system was always going to be a challenge, and any football fan with tactical awareness knew that Carlo Ancelotti had a big job on his hands. Carlo has shown in the past that he is capable of solving complex tactical systems, but that doesn't happen overnight. \n\nAnd yes, Mbappe is not at his best right now. Far from it. That is undeniable. But we're only 2-3 months into his Real Madrid career. He's adjusting to a new system, a new league, a new level of pressure. Many great players before, from Zidane to Cristiano, have spoken about the immense weight of the Real Madrid shirt. Not every player hits the ground running, and even fewer players maintain top form consistency so early. \n\nDeep down, we all know the truth: Mbappe is the best player of his generation. A few bad games is not going to erase that. This isn't FIFA, where you can just plug a player in and expect instant results. Success at Real Madrid comes from hard work and belief. We have seen countless players go through similar tough spells and emerge stronger than ever. If anything, the immense criticism he's facing now is a testament to the standards of this club. The same fans calling him out today will be celebrating his goals tomorrow. I'm sure of this. \n\nTo close, I want to remind everyone of Marcelo's words:  \n\n\n**\"Real Madrid will be back. You can put that on a poster. Stick it on your wall. Pray to it every night. We will be back\".**",
