        "title": "The discourse around Vini has been a clusterfuck and out of everyone, I expected Madridistas to know better.",
        "content": "Do you not remember how this all started? We could go back to the 2018-20 era where a teenager moved to the biggest club in the world, from a different continent, and due to bad circumstances, was unexpectedly forced to the front line and asked to be the club\u2019s starting left-winger; I shouldn\u2019t have to explain the immense pressure of being the guy who\u2019s asked to fill Ronaldo\u2019s boots, now imagine you\u2019re 18 and you just moved from halfway around the world. Remember when we used to call him \u201cFin\u00edcius\u201d? Now look at the player he\u2019s become.\n\nBut we don\u2019t even have to go back that far. I know a Madridista\u2019s memory can be short but do you remember the slowly emerging sentiment from rival fans between 2021-23 that Vini wasn\u2019t a good sport and he was toxic? It grew and grew after every game. they\u2019d clip moments where he\u2019s showboating or arguing and our 2022 UCL win only made it worse; because now he was a superstar. Now, did he do some showboating and arguing? Yes, I won\u2019t deny that, but why the fuck are we cozying up to our rival fans and agreeing with them? They are not our friends; they want nothing but to see Real Madrid fail.\n\nNow, here\u2019s where I think the clusterfuck started: In late 2022, racist language started to rise in the away stadiums and social media; it was always there but I think this is when it started to become mainstream. This all culminated in early 2023 when the Mestalla chanted \u201cmono, mono, mono\u201d. Vini reacted. I don\u2019t want to discuss whether or not he should have done so, but I just ask that you understand why he did; that is an important distinction. To experience someone viewing you as subhuman because of something you can\u2019t change, you cannot expect a person to just \u201cignore it\u201d.\n\nSo he reacted, and then other racists realised what they could do, and then all the noise started to blend together from the 2021-23 haters who judged him on his antics and the racists who judged him on the colour of his skin, and when he complained that he \u201cjust wanted to play football\u201d, all his haters (non-racists + racists) reply with \u201cthen don\u2019t dive and argue\u201d, because both groups have the same message but where they\u2019re coming from is different, and when they all get accused of being racists for this, the non-racists get even more mad.\n\nNow about this recent development where he\u2019s arguing with our team. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever been in a team before or even in a group of friends, but shit like this HAPPENS. Tensions are high in the moment and all you and I see are what happens in public; we don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like indoors. I know it\u2019s bad optics that the person he argued with was Luka, but shit like this happens all the time. I just think it\u2019s important to take a step back and separate all of this hate towards Vini: It\u2019s all clustering together and forming into one big \u201cVini is toxic\u201d narrative.\n\nThe shit that makes my blood boil is when I hear it coming from MADRIDISTAS. Do you not remember? Do you have such a short memory? We have always had players of a \u201ctoxic\u201d variety on the pitch \u2013 Ramos, Pepe, Ronaldo, Casemiro \u2013 and it didn\u2019t matter because they were OUR PLAYERS. They would bleed for us and the least we could do is support them back.\n\nAt the very least, can someone confirm to me that I got the timeline right? There definitely used to be a disproportionate hate on Vini from 2021-23 and then when the element of racism was added into the mix, everyone just forgot all this history? Out of everyone, I\u2019d expect Madridistas to know better.",

Then Modri\u0107 went towards Vin\u00edcius and asked him to return and support the team defensively.\n\nVin\u00edcius did not like that and responded to Modri\u0107, who in turn raised his voice and scolded him publicly. Alfredi also did not like Vin\u00edcius's reaction and asked him to respect Modri\u0107. \n\nModri\u0107 was annoyed with Vin\u00edcius more than once for not cooperating with the group defensively. He spoke to him twice and asked him to return, but the Brazilian ignored him. The third time, Modri\u0107 spoke to him and asked him the same thing. Vin\u00edcius responded with a gesture with open hands as if to say, \"What do you want from me?\" Modri\u0107 shouted at him, \"Go to hell.\"\n\nCadena Ser confirmed that these shots did not appear in the TV broadcast. Vinicius left the field immediately after the referee's whistle and did not celebrate with his teammates.\n",

They refer to the last statement after the Espanyol-Real Madrid, in which they questioned the professionalism of the referee, and to the continuous videos that are broadcast on Real Madrid TV criticizing alleged errors against whites.\n\nOn the other hand, different sources have congratulated the Federation for the call for this first meeting among all those involved in professional football. \"This is historic. Being able to tell the referees what we think and being able to continue working like this, in tune, is wonderful,\" says a manager of a First Division team. Among the most understanding, FC Barcelona: \"Possibly, we have done things wrong in the past, but now we want to be closer to all of you,\" said one of its managers.\u201d",
