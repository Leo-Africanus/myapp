While we know we have incredible players like Rodrygo, Mbapp\u00e9, and Vini, and their talent can light up any game, overconfidence has a way of backfiring. This is something Barcelona fans have also dealt with, it even reflected in their players\u2019 comments.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t call me arrogant when I keep winning.\u201d Yet, football has proven time and again that such thinking can lead to unexpected outcomes. For example, Inter is often dismissed as \u201cjust a defensive team that sits back,\u201d but underestimating them is a dangerous mistake. The same overconfidence struck AC Milan in 2007 when they thought they were above Liverpool before the Champions League final. They were humbled in the most memorable way.\n\nFor us to maintain our consistency as a team, it\u2019s essential that our players respect the game, their opponents, and the effort required to succeed. I hope next season, they approach every match with 100% effort and avoid falling into the trap of overconfidence.\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who pointed out that Milan actually won in 2007. I was referring to the 2005 final.",

Brahim Diaz played one bad game against Barcelona (he didn\u2019t even play the entire 90 minutes) and people forget his contributions towards the club.\n\nHe usually plays well and Madrid wouldn\u2019t have made it past Atletico without him. Also, there were multiple reasons why Madrid lost last el clasico, including Vinicius\u2019 poor decision making, Rodrygo\u2019s off season, many injuries, and Ancelotti\u2019s tactics.\n\nEdit: Some of you guys failed to understand that I am saying that you shouldn\u2019t say to sell a player and get so angry at them after a few mistakes here and there. It\u2019s alright to say that a player is PART of the reason a team lost but to blame them entirely is another thing. I\u2019m not being a hypocrite by pointing out the failures of other players too, and I even admitted that Brahim had a bad game (it\u2019s implied that he was part of the reason Madrid lost).",

Do yall remember gulers performance against Villarreal? And all the mistakes he made and all the fans saying that his time is over? Look at him now. \n\nId say until he gets more game time then it\u2019s unfair to give a true answer for him.\n\nAlso Joan Martinez is coming back so there\u2019s really no need for saliba. Just my opinion though. \n ",

        "content": "The Unify League is set to start in September of 2026. It will have a huge impact on the footballing world with every match free to watch through high-paying advertisers and with the UEFA middleman out of the equation.\n\nNow the proposal features strict financial sustainability rules (FSR) which will have an effect on many teams who want to participate. \"European club competitions should be governed by the clubs as they are domestically, not by third parties who benefit without taking any risk. The governance structure must be fully compliant with EU law. To improve sustainability, spending should be based only on resources generated, not from competition-distorting capital injections. Financial Sustainability rules should allow clubs to only spend a fixed percentage of their annual football-related revenue on player salaries and net transfers with appropriate provisions for smaller clubs and transition rules.\"(https://a22sports.com/en/about-a22/)\n\nHaaland's 10-year contract could possibly be in preparation for the Unify League. Many players who want to play at the top league (Star League) of the Unify League will present transfer opportunities that Madrid can take advantage of. But the general idea is that there is uncertainty about what will happen, and with Florentino being a key figure in the league, his frugality means he knows something besides the stadium renovation payments. \n\nI believe this summer and the following are going to explode with transfers with the competition starting in the following year. I'm interested to see what will happen, and there really is no reason for the competition to be delayed anymore due to the CJEU ruling giving the green light. ",
