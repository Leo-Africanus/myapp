The team makes a huge leap in the table from 18th to 13th, and leaves the relegation zone for the first time in months\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 19:30 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee**: Alejandro Morilla Turi\u00f3n\n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 2, Matchday 19\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[FEF TV](https://feftv.com) (subscription - 12.99\u20ac/month)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (5-2-3): Diego Pi\u00f1eiro - Youssef Enr\u00edquez \u2018Yusi\u2019 (83' Victor Valdepe\u00f1as 'Valde'), Mario Rivas, Jacobo Ram\u00f3n, Quique Ribes, David Jim\u00e9nez - Jos\u00e9 Maria Andr\u00e9s \u2018Chema\u2019, Manuel \u00c1ngel (68' Antonio David) - V\u00edctor Mu\u00f1oz (90' Edgar Pujol), Gonzalo Garc\u00eda, Pol Fortuny (83' Bruno Iglesias (90' Baba Diocou)) \n\nBench: Mario de Luis (GK). \n\nUnavailable: Fran Gonz\u00e1lez (first team call-up), Ra\u00fal Asencio (first team call-up), David Cuenca (pubalgia), David Ruiz (?), Loren Aguado (first team call-up), Andr\u00e9s Campos (?), C\u00e9sar Palacios (ACL tear), Borja Alonso (muscle injury), Jeremy de Le\u00f3n (ankle injury), Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga (muscle injury). \n\nCoach: Ra\u00fal\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** DWLWL\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 18th | 19pt | 4-7-7 | 27:22\n",

Ceballos should also start, with either Valverde or Asensio on the right, as we can\u2019t afford to start the game with both Lucas and Mendy. Additionally, Vini and Mbapp\u00e9 must contribute defensively to avoid 2v1 situations against Yamal and Kound\u00e9.\n\nWe have all the ingredients to win this game. Barcelona\u2019s tactical approach hasn\u2019t changed, and you can\u2019t lose twice to the same tactic.",
