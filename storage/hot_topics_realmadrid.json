        "title": "Rodrygo Has Run Out of Options",
        "content": "Rodrygo Goes, the Brazilian winger at Real Madrid, finds himself in a complex situation regarding his professional future. Despite being highly regarded in Europe, his role at the club has been drastically reduced, with very limited participation in key matches like the Copa del Rey final and the Club World Cup final. Real Madrid is considering selling him to complete two crucial transactions in the transfer window, though no formal offers have yet been received.\n\nClubs such as Bayern Munich and Liverpool have opted for other targets, while Arsenal has not advanced beyond preliminary interest. Only Tottenham remains as a potential suitor, albeit a less prominent one. This leaves Rodrygo with few alternatives amid declining physical and emotional condition, having lost weight and confidence. The club would only entertain offers of around \u20ac100 million, which presents a significant hurdle in today\u2019s competitive market.\n\nA Market in Flux\n\nAs the global market heads toward a high-stakes finish in spending, there are still players looking for a new space to shine. Rodrygo, born in 2001 in Osasco, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, is among them  \ufffc.\n\nWhile he\u2019s on many clubs\u2019 radar, and Real Madrid hasn\u2019t yet received an official offer, the club\u2019s planning includes his departure to fund the final moves needed to complete their dream squad  \ufffc. Rodrygo played only 45 minutes in the Copa del Rey final against Barcelona in April and 92 minutes in the Club World Cup\u2014indicating how limited his game time has become  \ufffc.\n\nAlthough Rodrygo and his representatives have publicly expressed his desire to remain at Madrid, reports suggest the club views him as a transfer candidate following his substitution in the Copa del Rey final  \ufffc.\n\nPhysical and Mental Decline\n\nSince then, Rodrygo has struggled with a physical imbalance that caused him to lose nearly five kilos, as well as an emotional downturn due to his lack of effectiveness in front of goal. Even a stay in Brazil with his two children did not fully help him clear his mind  \ufffc.\n\nInterest Fading from Big Clubs\n\nDespite maintaining a strong reputation across Europe, major clubs are looking elsewhere. Bayern has decided to sign Luis D\u00edaz (for around \u20ac80 million) and Liverpool has not progressed its interest in Rodrygo. Real Madrid insists on offers close to \u20ac100 million if a sale is to happen  \ufffc.\n\nLiverpool\u2019s considerable winter spending\u2014such as Wirtz (\u20ac125M) and Ekitike (\u20ac95M)\u2014may also explain the lack of movement regarding Rodrygo  \ufffc. Meanwhile, Arsenal has already invested roughly \u20ac200 million in Zubimendi (\u20ac70M), Madueke (\u20ac56M), and Gy\u00f6keres (\u20ac75M), reducing appetite for another major forward signing  \ufffc.\n\nOnly Tottenham remains an option\u2014but it\u2019s seen as a step down compared to the other clubs. Gradually, Rodrygo is running out of viable alternatives to leave Real Madrid this summer  ",

Arsenal also talk so much, they say they will pay big money, but still no real bid. PSG even, but Real Madrid says no offer came yet.

Facundo Campazzo elite PG with a lot of experience magician on the court, Andres Feliz a defensive beast often called as Pitbull. Overall 9.5/10 and the best PG in europe if not the best top 3 for sure. ",

        "content": "Everywhere throughout the internet, whenever you criticise players performance and level ,you have people saying \"ohh are you forgetting what he did for us in X and y season\" , \" ohh people forget this and that \" . \n\nIf we win trophies one season we can't keep reliving the moment whilst other teams bags trophies the next and next season.\n\n Outstanding previous performance shouldn't be a justification or allowance for under performance , afterall we are real Madrid and our goal every season is to win every tournament we are in . \n\nAnd am not commending hate , am just saying as much as we are grateful for our players great past accomplishments, we can't use that to justify there poor performance (or in Alaba's case if he deserves to stay or not ) because \nwe could just use that excuse every season and we ain't gonna win anything no more.\n \nNote : am okay with one season underperformance after that no justification, I am complaining more on the absence of growth mindset in fans than anything.\nThis post is more of a reaction to the Alaba post below, if you were wondering.
