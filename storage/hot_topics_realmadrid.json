Because a lot of you must be new and it\u2019s telling by the way the activity on this sub has had an uptick. I assume it\u2019s the post Covid era and Madrid winning in those years that lead a lot of you here. \n\nLet me show you something. This team has never been stable, it\u2019s never lacked egos and every single manager has always been one bad month from being fired, even if you are a living legend. \n\nNo player has ever been free of criticism and there has always been those few that are die hard of the team but wish its best player would leave because they don like their personalities. In all honesty, 22/23 was the first year where we won and it wasn\u2019t a bumpy road to the trophies. \n\nNo, the sky isn\u2019t falling, no there isn\u2019t a crisis and no the team won\u2019t change and the players that make the team what it is won\u2019t ever change either. \n\nThanks for coming to my Ted talk . \n ",

        "content": "That was when the squad was fully fit \u2014 when Milit\u00e3o was leading the defense and delivering outstanding performances; when Carvajal and Arnold were both available on the right back; when Valverde wasn\u2019t forced to abandon his midfield role to compensate for their absence; when Huijsen was playing regularly and with consistent form.\n\nAll of that happened when the entire team stood behind the coach \u2014 when we watched our team playing with aggression and high spirit. From the very first match at the Club World Cup, we all noticed how quickly the team recovered the ball after losing it, the tactical discipline in executing the high press, and the immense physical effort every player put in \u2014 including forwards and midfielders fulfilling their defensive duties.\n\nEverything was ideal. Yes, we weren\u2019t the most entertaining or the most complete team, but we were winning. We were convincing. We were watching a real, united team on the pitch. We were winning without needing Courtois\u2019 decisive, heroic saves like we see in recent matches.\n\nThe change and the decline began when every viewer started to feel that the team had become disjointed, and that the players\u2019 personalities had begun to overshadow the coach\u2019s authority. Ego started to rule Real Madrid \u2014 that is the truth.\n\nWhen Vin\u00edcius started laughing and shouting when being substituted; when Bellingham became angrier on the pitch; when everyone noticed Valverde\u2019s dissatisfaction while playing at right-back; the Rodrygo drama and his lack of goals; the Arda G\u00fcler drama and his rivalry with Bellingham \u2014 and on top of all that, the injuries and absences that truly devastated the team.\n\nReal Madrid were excellent, even if not perfect, at the start of the season \u2014 18 wins out of 21 matches. Even the two defeats against Paris and Atl\u00e9tico came mainly from individual mistakes (let\u2019s remember what Asencio and R\u00fcdiger did early in the match against PSG).\n\nAnd before you say our opponents were weak, let me remind you that those 18 wins included Barcelona, Juventus, Dortmund, Villarreal, Marseille \u2014 as well as several particularly tough matches in La Liga.\n\nYes, Xabi Alonso was not perfect. We didn\u2019t understand many of his in-game choices and decisions. But it is impossible for me to believe that Xabi is the problem when, with a united and fully fit squad, we witnessed one of the best starts to a Real Madrid season in years.",

The other is incredibly streaky. Top in the world on his day, but the day rarely comes. \n\n\nMy question is; who is more justified? Is Mbapp\u00e9 allowed to be defensively lazy because of his offensive output and are Vini\u2019s offensive woes deserving of lenience because of his defensive effort? \n\n\nI ask for objectivity here. I understand with all the drama of this season, it\u2019s easier to dig into one player or the next, but this is a serious inquiry of mine.",

If a player like valverde who sacrificed his position for like 3 times in 3 different season and bellingham who literally played with dislocated shoulder for 2 years are getting scapegoat then honestly you should stop supporting real madrid. These are some of the best time for media to boost their clicks and us madridistas should ignore it and support our team and back our new manager. All the best to xabi and his staff but the chapter of him with us is over and we should move on. Onto copa del rey tomorrow. HALA MADRID Y NADA MAS",

And most importantly, he isn't injury prone and would actually be available to us for the entire season, unlike Rudiger, Alaba, Mendy, Militao etc. Also, we don't have many realistic options for CBs this summer.\n\nKonate's form has dropped &amp; Madrid lost interest. Upamecano renewed with Bayern. Guehi is apparently going to City. So we either sign someone unproven, use our academy players, or spend big on a proven player (which is unlikely unfortunately). Getting Nacho back would be a cheaper &amp; better alternative imo.",
