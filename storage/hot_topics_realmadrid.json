        "content": "#FT: OSASUNA B 1:0 CASTILLA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#1\u00aa FEDERACI\u00d3N\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:** \n\n1:0 Ander Yoldi 22'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - kick off, vamos! \n\n5' - the streaming platform is showing the wrong match... Every year it's a new platform, but the same incompetence in this league... \n\n15' - first quarter of an hour is gone, LaLiga+ has not noticed their error so far, and I still can't watch the game - I hope the team started well... \n\n\u26bd 22' - Osasuna score - I still cannot watch the match\n\n35' - 34 minutes played, and they finally put the correct match! \n\nHT - obviously I could only watch the last 10 minutes, but the way Castilla are playing is straight up alarming, they fail to create any danger at all, can't get tempo into their attacking and are also shaky in defense despite little pressure by Osasuna who focus on defending their lead\n\n46' - 2nd half underway \n\n\ud83d\udd04 59' - first sub, Y\u00e1\u00f1ez on for Pol Fortuny \n\n\ud83d\udd04 66' - next sub, Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga for Thiago Pitarch. An absolutely terrible second half of the team so far, absolutely no danger whatsoever\n\n70' - Fran Gonz\u00e1lez keeps the team in the match with a great 1v1 save after an easy counter by Osasuna - this team needs to wake up! \n\n76' - a penalty is reviewed for a pull on Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, but the ref does not change his decision. For me, it was not enough\n\n\ud83d\udd04 78' - Palacios off for Gabri Castrelo, last sub \n\n79' - first good chance for Castilla in possibly the entire game - Castrelo's shot from a tight angle is saved nicely by their keeper\n\n82' - Aguado takes a rebound on the volley nicely, but it flies just over the bar \n\nFT - an absolutely awful performance by Castilla leads to the third loss in a row, without scoring a single goal, or I'd even say, without generating a single clear cut chance for the past 270 minutes. With the U20 World Cup coming up and Fortea, Pitarch, Cristian, Fran and Aguado being out for at least a month, this situation can go from bad to worse if Arbeloa doesn't rethink everything about the way he sets up this team, this way of playing doesn't work, we need to give up the control so there is some space to play into, especially since we don't have any attacker that can make the difference by himself against a tough defence\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 12:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Instalaciones Deportivas de Tajonar, Pamplona\n\n**Referee**: Aimar Velasco Arbaiza\n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 1, Matchday 4\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[LaLiga+](https://www.laligaplus.laliga.com/) (subscription - 14.99\u20ac/month) (only available in Spain)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-3-3): Fran Gonz\u00e1lez - Diego Aguado, Lamini Fati, Joan Mart\u00ednez, Jesus Fortea - Jorge Cestero, Thiago Pitarch (66' Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga), Manuel \u00c1ngel - Bruno Iglesias, C\u00e9sar Palacios (78' Gabri Castrelo), Pol Fortuny (59' Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez) \n\nBench: Guille S\u00fanico (GK), Alejandro Moya, Mario Rivas, Manu Serrano, V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as, Cristian David, Roberto Mart\u00edn, Jacobo Ortega. \n\nUnavailable: Sergio Mestre (first team call-up), David Jim\u00e9nez (first team call-up), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Rachad Fettal (injury). \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** WWLL\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 16th | 3pt | 1-0-2 | 2:3\n",

        "title": "Have you ever thought Benzema was overshadowed by CR7 and Bale?",
        "content": "When CR7 and Bale played for Real Madrid, almost everything were built around these two and as it planned, they made it; they were so good at dribbling, at scoring, at assisting, at passing that every Madridista loved them. However, Benzema looked like he was overshadowed by them; he couldn't score and assist as they could but I don't think it was about him being bad or something. He wasn't in the plans enough about scoring; I felt like he was more like responsible for establishing the pass connections in the forward line for CR7 and Bale. After all of these, when we were in 2022, CR7 wasn't already there, Bale wasn't even thought like he was there. It was the time for Benzema; everything was built around him, he became the captain, he played as a pure 9. When that happened, he performed the best, including all of his time in Real Madrid. He won against PSG completely all himself, He was in a critical role winning against City. Briefly, it wouldn't be weird if we said It was all for Benzema 80%-90% of success Real Madrid had in 21/22 season. Considering all this, I feel like Benzema was unfortunately really overshadowed rest of his times other than 21/22 here. What do you think?",

I saw tourists taking pictures, barely any chants the only coordinated moments were when the announcer shouted player names and even then half the people didn\u2019t know the second half of players' name so there were rows of just dead silence.  \n  \nThis seems like such a trivial thing for team like madrid, honestly feels like a tourist attraction.

        "title": "Do we still need a Midfield Controller?",
        "content": "So we all know that last year our biggest issue was that Toni Kroos was not replaced and we suffered from a lack of a high volume, accurate, press resistant and creative passer to circulate and progress the ball from defence to attack. We eventually used Ceballos who then got injured and finally we settled Modric and Arda who couldn't really keep up with the physical demands of the game against energetic opposition for a full 90 minutes. \n\nThis season we still have Ceballos but he's inconsistent. And we have Arda who still struggles against physical opponents. \n\nBut what if we don't actually have the same need for a midfield controller as we did last season? What if the reason we needed one so bad was because we had Mendy/Fran as our LB and Rudiger paired with Ascenicio as our CBs and Lord Vazquez as our RB? \n\nWith Carreras, Huijsen, Militao and Trent/Carvajal, we have an infinitely more competent back line that is very capable of passing around and dribbling through the initial press. In Dean we have our highest volume and most accurate passer. He switches play and is extremely press resistant. Trent too is very adept at the short and long passing game. Militao and Carreras are no slouches on the ball and can also dribble out of pressure.\n\nNow add Tchouameni to the above and then ask yourself, in such a scenario do we actually need a dedicated DLP? Especially when we don't have one that's a perfect fit? \n\nI think Camavinga, Fede and Bellingham are all more than good enough to do the ball carrying required to help move the ball from this competent defence to our attackers.

        "content": "In games with limited midfield creativity, he must step down to collect the ball. R9 used to do this: he would take the ball from midfield and dribble into the opposing goal, either creating a chance or scoring. \n\nSo far, it's working, and if he hadn't done it against Espanyol, he'd have looked like Gonzalo Garcia, waiting indefinitely for that one chance.\n\n Furthermore, not standing in the box allows you to collect the cutback (which I believe is Cam's responsibility). I also believe that making Mbappe wait for the ball in the box wastes his talent. \n\nMy solution is that when Mbappe drifts wide, someone should fill in the space (Jude would be really good at this), and he just has to stay there and have a presence in the box, plus he's quite tall.",

This is not a critique to Valverde, he is my favorite player in Madrid, but it is evident he has not been the most important part of the team anymore. So, why is Valverde not as highlighted as he used to? I believe it is because of being given a specific role. Valverde is a kind of player that should play out of scheme. He was the one who ran everywhere on the pitch and made sure to contribute everywhere. However, this is also a good sign, the fact that Valverde is not being seen as much means that the team is not a mess like last year. If Valverde is the best player in the team that\u2019s unfortunately a bad sign. I feel like he should one of the only players in the team with no instructions since he is the best at moving around the pitch to contribute. ",
