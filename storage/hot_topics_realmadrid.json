Quick thoughts, anger, frustration, future lineups, players we should get rid of and sign, etc. Most of these posts have been removed.\n\nSimilar to the announcement that I made after the Arsenal loss, please direct these to the post-match thread and the open thread. There are too many posts going up right now that it\u2019s flooding the home page and most are getting removed. If your post is lengthy and generates its own discussion by itself, it could be posted in the future. There is too much urgency in the sub right now for everyone making their own post. \n\nThank you for your time \ud83d\ude0a ",

A great team takes their loss like a champ especially when it's your own fault not the refs or the managers.\nSure the refs last decision was a little questionable but you can't throw or cuss him. \nThis issue needs to be addressed by club itself. Vini going down after every tackle, even me whos sitting thousands of mile away, watching on 360p on buffering stream can see that was  clear ball and then he has the audacity to ask for a card. The cherry on the top is that he then just gives up. No or very little attempt to retake the ball. \nBesides, it goes deeper after arsenal game carvajal was choking saka, rudi standing on mls like bruh come on. You're setting a bad example for the juniors. \nSomething really needs to be done, we've become a laughing stock Infront of the world.\n",

Can't shoot for his life. Can't carry the ball forward. Can't connect a 1 foot pass for god's sake. And most importantly can't dribble for shit. On the other hand we need a fucking stiker to bury the chances created by vini, valverde, and arda guller. Next few games start guller to give him confidence.

        "content": "Regardless of how La Liga ends, this has been a disappointing season. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to say we got worse after Mbappe arrived and PSG got better, but that\u2019s just not true. We have key weaknesses in our team, and Mbappe simply isn\u2019t one of them. We clawed our way to a double last year that we perhaps didn\u2019t deserve, seeing as we barely had league competition and got outplayed in several UCL games that we won. It\u2019s now time to recognize the actual weaknesses in our team:\n\n1) Full backs: This is the most obvious one. Lucas simply isn\u2019t first team quality, and we\u2019ve had make shift left backs in important games that cost us.\n\n2) Attacking depth: For majority of the season, our subs have been anemic when given the chance. Arda has true potential, but Endrick and Brahim just aren\u2019t ready to provide that game changing impact off the bench.\n\n3) Management: Carlo is great when you have a team that already knows how to win. But Kroos leaving marked the true end of our prior core. This team is young, indisciplined at times, and in desperate need of an identity. We need a manager who can actually shape us tactically, which hopefully will be Xabi come next season.\n\n4) Rodrygo: This is controversial, but he\u2019s just been too inconsistent for me. Either we need to rework him into the team, or get a true world class RW and have Rodrygo accept a bench role.\n\nNothing lights a fire under Perez more than Barca having a great season, so I\u2019m confident we will be aggressive this summer. With these fixes, our team is more than capable of conquering Europe again \ud83d\udd25 ",

        "content": "After yet another loss to Barcelona this season there's a lot of frustration and a lot of people will jump on to some players who might've not had the best game or Ancelotti who yet again loses to Flick. And while I do agree with that and I agree that Ancelotti's time with Madrid has come to an end, I do think there's a bigger problem here that most people haven't noticed. This problem is Florentino Perez.\n\nThere's no denying he's one of the best presidents Madrid has ever had from a success point of view and especially from a financial and economic point of view. But for a while now, Perez has been kind of a dictator. He very rarely backs his managers with players that fit their tactics. Hasn't backed Ancelotti this season with a defender for example despite the very obvious lack of quality and depth in that position. Pretty much chooses the players he buys based on their marketability and how much merch they're going to sell.\n\nAnd on top of that, he's lately making enemies with pretty much everyone around us. It started with that Super League he wanted to create which has put us at odds with UEFA and FIFA, then against Javier Tebas the league president and finally against all Spanish referees with this whole campaign that Real Madrid's channel has made and these leaked rumors that said Madrid might not play the final which I have no doubt that Perez is behind. And regardless of what you guys think about his stances in these \"feuds\", you can't deny it's putting more pressure on even our own players and causing them unnecessary distraction.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is Perez Madrid's real problem?",

        "content": "Before anyone starts, I doubt players on scrolling on Reddit to see us \u201cbring them down\u201d on game day. It\u2019s a simple discussion. Starting this discussion before the match so fanboys don\u2019t assume that it started because we lost. There\u2019s been a shift in his management the last few years that point to him being more concerned about the super league than anything else. Please note, this is NOT to say that he isn\u2019t the best president we\u2019ve ever had. Simply sharing observations that pro-Madrid media has been hiding. \n\n* Squad planning: Yes, we have been winning trophies. But, let\u2019s admit it, we\u2019ve been going into each season and pushing our luck. From skipping a 9 every year to wait for Mbappe, to not sourcing replacements for Luka/Kroos (when we know they\u2019re career is coming to an end) to refusing to sign a proper RB and even CB (after 2 ACLs). Again, we\u2019ve made it work but it seems there\u2019s no long-term plan in place. We should\u2019ve had youngsters to bring in years ago. Where\u2019s our scouting team? Why is our cantera so poor at producing talents?\n\n* Transfers: We boast so much about being the best run club financially yet we\u2019re heavily relying on free transfers, unless the players come with a big Marketing tag attached. It seems that if they don\u2019t have a big $ market, then we refuse to spend any money and that\u2019s seen in our defense. It\u2019s usually the attackers and midfielders like Jude/Kylian that have big sponsorship deals attached. \n\n* Stadium: I read time and time again that concerts at the Bernabeu would bring so much income and pay for Mbappe\u2019s wages. Well, guess what? All concerts have been halted due to city noise ordinance and the club has downplayed it completely. We\u2019ve not heard any reporter say the economic impact that it\u2019s had. Which leads me to believe, are we actually doing well financially or are we inflating financial docs and lying to the public?\n\n* Communicado/RFEF/Barca: From helping our competition get their player registered to the piss poor communicado yesterday. I\u2019m a firm believer that RFEF is corrupt and that Barcelona benefits. But, he has to take a stance. He can\u2019t be approving RMTV videos and then playing nice in the office. Either you\u2019re fully committed and take this to courts or you stop being a clown. Look at the first communicado yesterday. We demand \u201cchange\u201d and filter that we won\u2019t show up to play. 3 hrs later, we say \u201cwe never intended not to play\u201d. Now we look like the biggest fools and rightfully so. \n\n* Wage structure: this is one where I trust Florentino. However, I can\u2019t help but think that bringing Mbappe on crazy wages will lead to Vini and then Jude requesting crazy wages that we may not be able to afford. I mean, I\u2019m seeing articles that Vini will demand more than CR7 made. I know inflation is considered but that\u2019s still an astronomical amount that the old Florentino would hold a firm stance on.  \n\nFor the fanboys, I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s not the best president. But the club above anyone. I\u2019m simply calling out things that I\u2019ve seen in the past 4-5 yrs since the Super league has been introduced. As fans (of a fan-owned club) we deserve answers and accountability. ",
