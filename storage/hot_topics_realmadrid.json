It would have involved lucrative personal terms, but did not develop into anything concrete.\n\nEarlier this year, Madrid made Vinicius Jr a renewal offer, including an increase in salary to around \u20ac20million net a year. When this was not accepted, the club asked the player\u2019s side to propose a figure.\n\nVinicius Jr\u2019s representatives requested a historic contract, in the region of the highest ever at the club (which was given to Cristiano Ronaldo), with a package of up to \u20ac30million per season. This included base salary, performance bonuses and a renewal bonus, something which has not been offered to players at Real Madrid previously.",

        "content": "First of all, Asencio was having a great game and then he did this madness sadly, so that was mainly his fault, also huijsen really didn't help him out. Second, seeing valverde out of all people decide to jog back and then eventually just stop moving is shocking. For example, if this was Barca, at least one of their midfielders would have been fighting for their lives getting back to help the defense, yet our captain that's only been on the field for 20 minutes just stops moving. I'm not trying to put the blame on him alone, my whole point is that the lack of effort from ALL of these players except for Guler, Jude, Asencio ( yes he gave them that 2nd goal but before that he was one of the only players that looked like he actually cared), and Gonzalo of course. This is another benefit of having academy players btw, because they fight like their lives depend on it. I rather see someone from the academy on the field instead of Ceballos for example, who wanted to leave a few months ago. Anyway, hopefully we see some positive changes in the future.",

        "content": "   I think at this point it has to be obvious that Mbappe is not a striker. So many people are so sure that Mbappe can play striker well and just has to learn. However, I think after so much, it is obvious he is not built for that. If you look at his way of playing, always shifts to the laterals of the pitch and plays deeper. If anything, he is more of a false 9, but without the playmaking qualities. I will keep saying it, we are wasting Mbappe by forcing him to play striker. Anyone who claims that he scores, yes he does, because he is Mbappe. Put him anywhere and he will deliver because he is world class, but that is not his best position for him or the team. The amount of times I see a beautiful play just for no one to be in the box is insane. For some reason Mbappe avoids the box as much as possible. I do not know how you would arrange the players after, but I would try Mbappe on the wing for at least one match. If you want to try stuff so much, then play your young prospects who are both strikers! Try playing Gonzalo on less important matches, play Mbappe on the wing for a couple matches, put Endrick, etc. I don\u2019t understand this fixedness on keeping Mbappe as a number nine. When we played the CWC we were doing pretty well because we had a proper 9. Unless we get one, we will keep doing bad. ",

        "content": "Someone recently posted a graphic on this sub, which showed 5 players in the 23/24 season had 10+ goals (Jude, Vini, Rodrygo, Joselu, and motherfucking Brahim Diaz). \n\nLet's look at how our current attack is faring in the league as we near the end of the first half of the season: \n\n\\- Mbappe: 13 goals (hip hip hooray for the Mbappe fanboys)\n\n\\- Vini: 5 goals (surprised to see him in 2nd place given his inconsistent form)\n\n\\- Guler: 3 goals\n\n\\- Jude: 2 goals (lol, how the fuck is Jude 4th on the list when he pretty much just came back from surgery). \n\nThree other players have 1 goal each, and literally everyone else has a big fat ZERO, including Valverde, Camavinga, and Rodrygo. This begs the question: how the fuck did we go from being a well-balanced attack with 5 players bagging 10+ goals to basically Mbappe FC? Losing Kroos was a big blow, but there's no way one player's departure can lead to such a drastic difference in the attack. \n\nIt also raises another question, why the fuck can't our midfield and defense help out the attack? I'm not expecting prime Ramos numbers, but fuck me, this is dismal. \n\n",

        "content": "After watching the 2\u20132 draw vs Elche, it\u2019s pretty clear what Real Madrid is missing right now. The squad is elite, the talent is there, but the team looks disorganized and blunt in attack. Here are the three things Madrid actually needs:\n\n**1. A real striker**  \nMbapp\u00e9 is world-class, but he is not a pure 9. Every time he plays centrally, the team loses width and unpredictability. He\u2019s at his best when he starts wide on the left and attacks space. Madrid need a striker who stays in the box, finishes chances, and gives the team a reference point for crosses like Trents. Someone who can turn all those half-chances into goals.\n\n**2. Tactical stability**  \nXabi Alonso is experimenting way too much every game. It\u2019s making the team lose structure. Madrid needs a consistent system, a fixed midfield anchor, and a front line that actually fits together. When the team has stability, the quality improves a lot.\n\n**3. Focus and intensity**  \nConceding twice vs Elche came from switching off and losing duels. Madrid have now gone three games without a win, not because they\u2019re worse, but because the players couldn't care less. They need better concentration, and a sharper mentality which would fix half the problems.",
