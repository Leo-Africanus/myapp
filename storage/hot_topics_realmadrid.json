No major upsets and controversial predictions in the group stages.   \n  \nIn the R16, I predict River Plate to knock out Dortmund, unfortunately one of the biggest chokers in Europe. I expect Adeyami to miss 5+ shots including sitters and then maybe a 1-0 for River Plate on the counter. \n\nIn QF, the highest paid coach of world football will use his haramball tactics to kick out Bayern, assuming Musiala doesn't play in proper form. With Muller leaving and them failing to get Wirtz and Nico Williams, with them losing Kim while Kompany is still their manager, I expect ATM to win this. Not to mention that Sorloth and Alvarez are amazing right now and we can never sleep on Griezmann. No other upset.\n\nIn the SF, I again would say that since Pep's tactics are now no longer that good, with Crystal Palace and multiple PL clubs being able to tackle it with tier 2 players, I would say ATM would again play a low block and defend for their lives. Sorloth/Alvarez will go on to score in one of their counter plays and then park an aeroplane in front of the bus. The match will also get violent for sure but Simeone wins. As for Madrid and PSG, I do not have conviction that Madrid would win but you wouldnt expect me to be a fan and say PSG would win right xd? This is a new madrid and PSG haven't started training for the CWC, Enrique is not taking this very seriously, although their squad is young and hungry. Let's just assume for our sake Madrid wins.\n\nFinals - No upset here, we don't lose finals and we don't lose to Atleti in international competitions. \n\nThoughts?",

I've seen mixed reviews around the stadium construction being still ongoing and limiting where the tour is able to go, no pitch view, no dugouts etc. If this is mainly a museum trip, I wonder if its worth waiting until my next trip to Spain.",
