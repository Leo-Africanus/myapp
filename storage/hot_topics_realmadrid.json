        "title": "[OC] Real Madrid Castilla - 2024/25 player-by-player squad review",
        "content": "DISCLAIMER: My comments and ratings are based on my own observations and perception of the players' performances this season. I decided to only rate players with at least 500 minutes played. \"Future at Madrid\" and \"Next season\" are not what will officially happen, but just my personal predictions.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0yfsv509z45f1.png?width=4070&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65cdb37620fe09761bed5fe8215414d4f7c1769b\n\n**#1 Diego Pi\u00f1eiro - GK - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - 2004**\n\n**8 matches - 720 minutes (21.1%) - 3 clean sheets**\n\nAfter a season without any appearances in 2023/24, Pi\u00f1eiro hoped to see much more of the pitch this season. He got a few appearances throughout the season, but still ended up as the keeper with the least minutes played. He was not entirely convincing in the matches he played, but also showed some promise, for example on the last matchday against Alcoyano where he held the clean sheet with 6 saves. Next season, it's most likely he will leave, as according to transfermarkt, his contract is running out this summer.\n\n**My rating:** 5.5/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** no\n\n**Next season:** transfer\n\n\u00a0\n\n**#13 Fran Gonz\u00e1lez - GK - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - 2005**\n\n**19 matches - 1720 minutes (50%) - 5 clean sheets**\n\nFran was the number one goalkeeper for Castilla this season, playing exactly 50% of minutes while Pi\u00f1eiro and de Luis had to share the rest of the minutes. Internally in the club, he seems to be the highest rated keeper of the bunch, with people comparing him to Courtois due to his height and reach, but this season, he has not looked the part in most matches. In the first half of the season, he made various mistakes, smaller and bigger, that led to the team conceding goals. When he lost his spot to de Luis at the start of the year, suddenly the team's defense was much more stable and steady. Nonetheless, he also had good matches, reaching some balls that I doubt de Luis or Pi\u00f1eiro could've reached, and he got to make his first team debut against Valencia, which sadly ended in a loss through no fault of his own. Next season, I assume he will keep on starting for Castilla.\n\n**My rating:** 5/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** unlikely\n\n**Next season:** Castilla starter\n\n\u00a0\n\n**#24 Mario de Luis - GK - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - 2002**\n\n**11 matches - 990 minutes (28.9%) - 4 clean sheets**\n\nMario de Luis surprisingly stayed with Castilla for another year despite already having been banished by Ra\u00fal in 2023/24. I never understood Ra\u00fal's treatment of him,  he was simply outstanding in his first Castilla season, but then never really got close to the same opportunities again. This season, after warming the bench for the first half of the season again, suddenly he took the starting spot at the start of the year, and as I expected him to be, he was as great as always, making various impossible saves while also not making any costly mistakes. His performances led to him getting called up to and debuting for Spain U21s. Due to his age, he needs to leave the club this summer and finally fulfill his big potential somewhere else.\n\n**My rating:** 7.5/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** no\n\n**Next season:** transfer\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2b40yvqaz45f1.png?width=4070&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=814f233671122cc5ec6b514ca1b2fdf8904b0f9a\n\n**#2 Lorenzo Aguado - RB - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - 2002**\n\n**23 matches - 1059 minutes (31%) - 1 goal - 1 assist**\n\nTo the surprise of many that follow the academy, Lorenzo was the right back that Ancelotti picked for the first team dynamic over other players like David Jim\u00e9nez and Fortea, making 3 appearances for the first team. In Castilla however, he was just the backup for David - if Lorenzo started, it was usually because he was needed in the 3atb behind David. When he played, he was mostly solid, offering a good balance between attack and defense, not being outstanding in either direction however. His contract is running out this summer according to transfermarkt, and being one of the oldest players in the squad, he should leave in any case.\n\n**My rating:** 5/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** no\n\n**Next season:** transfer\n\n\u00a0\n\n**#3 David Cuenca - LB - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - 2002**\n\n**5 matches - 292 minutes (8.5%)**\n\nDavid Cuenca, who surprisingly got to feature a lot for Castilla last season, started this season off sharing minutes with Youssef at left back. Sadly, a very persistent case of pubalgia that needed surgery saw him missing the entire rest of the season. Due to his age, he should leave Castilla this summer.\n\n**My rating:** \\--/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** no\n\n**Next season:** transfer\n\n\u00a0\n\n**#4 Edgar Pujol - CB - \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddf4 - 2004**\n\n**23 matches - 1548 minutes (44.3%) - 1 assist**\n\nAfter playing in the Olympics last summer for the Dominican Republic, Edgar started his 3rd Castilla season with some injury struggles. When Asencio joined the first team and the personnel situation at center back got dire, he claimed a starting spot in the back three, but he was not very convincing most of the time. He is still a good talent and is a great asset in build-up play, but his presence and awareness in defense leaves a lot to be desired, and I felt like the defense was more stable with Quique Ribes in his place. He could stay with Castilla for yet another season, but I think he would just block the progress of the great talents we have at center back, like Jacobo, Rivas, Joan, Diego Aguado, Valdepe\u00f1as or Laimini Fati.\n\n**My rating:** 5/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** no\n\n**Next season:** transfer\n\n\u00a0\n\n**#5 Ra\u00fal Asencio - CB - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - 2003**\n\n**11 matches - 990 minutes (28.9%)**\n\nNow, this will be a very interesting bit of text to write, because no matter what I write here, it will look very confusing and surreal for the people who have only watched him for the first team so far. Asencio's season is an absurd and perfect example of what are the most important qualities of an academy prospect, even more than talent or physical disposition: seizing opportunities, playing with natural confidence, and plain and simply, some luck and mere coincidences. The amount of players that had to get injured to catapult Asencio to where he is now is of an almost comedic length, from Marvel, Carrillo and Jacobo last season to Alaba, Milit\u00e3o, Vallejo, Tchouam\u00e9ni, Jacobo and Joan this season, but he seized the opportunity like I've barely seen it before, flipped a switch and completely locked in from the first moment he stepped on the pitch for the first team. He didn't convince me whatsoever in his time with Castilla, and at the start of the season he showed his usual, mediocre level. Stepping out of the line too aggressively, showing lack of tactical discipline and positioning himself awkwardly on many of the goals he conceded. Purely on his performances for Castilla, I can't rate him any higher than a 4 out of 10, but generally speaking, for what you want to see in a Castilla player's development, this season could literally not have gone any better with him seeing starter-level minutes for the first team. Next season, he will surely play with the first team again, unless his court case develops in an unfavourable manner.\n\n**My rating:** 4/10 (Castilla), 10/10 (overall)\n\n**Future at Madrid:** yes (court case?)\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Next season:** Real Madrid first team\n\n**#14 Jacobo Ram\u00f3n - CB - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - 2005**\n\n**15 matches - 1305 minutes (38.2%) - 4 goals**\n\nJacobo's season started just like last season went for him, persistent muscular injuries keeping him out for months. When he finally returned to the team, he immediately showed an amount of leadership and dominance in defense that the team had direly missed before. Castilla's defense was more stable from that moment on, and while his performance in defence was already more than sufficient, Jacobo scored 4 goals for Castilla as a bonus, being a consistent source of danger from set-pieces. He got to play 5 matches for the first team, and even managed to score his first goal against Mallorca, though his general performance was relatively shaky and lacking composure. He really was the anti-Asencio this season, but if Xavi and Arbeloa can somehow instill more conficence into him, he could start translating his performances to the first team as well. Next season, he will definitely start and lead Castilla's defense.\n\n**My rating:** 8/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** maybe\n\n**Next season:** Castilla starter\n\n\u00a0\n\n**#15 Quique Ribes - CB - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - 2004**\n\n**29 matches - 2059 minutes (60.2%) - 2 goals**\n\nAfter his surprising rise from Real Madrid C player to Castilla starter last season, Ra\u00fal trusted Quique once more and played him a lot in the earlier parts of the season. When Edgar Pujol returned from injury, he spent more and more time on the bench, still getting decent minutes here and there though. He was mostly solid, but didn't really stand out positively in the way Rivas or Jacobo did in many matches, and was one of the faces of the slump the entire squad and also the defense went through in the early part of the season. He should move on to make space for the huge center back talents that are coming up next season.\n\n**My rating:** 6/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** no\n\n**Next season:** transfer\n\n\u00a0\n\n**#17 David Ruiz - LB - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - 2003**\n\n**18 matches - 714 minutes (20.9%)**\n\nDavid Ruiz is one of quite a few players that would not even have gotten promoted to Castilla if it wasn't for the extraordinarily dire situation of the squad in the summer - he was good for Real Madrid C the season before, although not spectacular. He was a sub option for Youssef or on the left wing throughout most of the season, and couldn't leave his mark on the league in his minutes this season, not being more reliable in defense than Youssef while also being much less dynamic and technical than him in attack. He should most likely leave the club this summer.\n\n**My rating:** 3.5/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** no\n\n**Next season:** transfer\n\n\u00a0\n\n**#22 - David Jim\u00e9nez - RB - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - 2004**\n\n**37 matches - 3103 minutes (90.7%) - 3 goals - 5 assists**\n\nDavid had already earned a promotion to Castilla before this season, after his simply spectacular season with Juvenil A (5 goals, 17 assists) in 2022/23. He had to take the longer path and spend a season with Real Madrid C, where he also excelled and finally got his deserved spot in the Castilla squad. He was the nailed-on starter at right (wing) back from the get-go, and his extraordinary technique was visible throughout the entire season. He consistently put in great crosses, made 5 assists and could've had even more, while also scoring 3 goals, including a beautiful free kick. However, he is neither strong, tall, nor fast, so he is always a bit of a liability in defense, and this will probably get exacerbated in higher levels even more. Nonetheless, for what Castilla needed from their right back this season especially with the lack of other creative outlets like Arribas or Nico the seasons before, he did extremely well. He will probably compete with Fortea for his spot next season.\n\n**My rating:** 8/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** maybe\n\n**Next season:** Castilla starter\n\n\u00a0\n\n**#23 - Youssef Enr\u00edquez - LB - \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\udde6 - 2005**\n\n**35 matches - 2741 minutes (80.1%) - 1 goal - 3 assists**\n\nYoussef earned promotion to Castilla through his great season with Juvenil A with 2 goals and 12 assists last season. At the start of the season, he struggled to pick up the same rhythm and was found out in defense a multitude of times, while failing to connect with his crosses up front when his counterpart David Jim\u00e9nez was already putting in dimes for our attackers. But as the season went on he got much more comfortable and confident, as the rest of the defense improved he also found his footing, and he found his usual, high level again with his play in attack. There is a lot more potential in him that is waiting to be unlocked in the next seasons, and if he doesn't stay with Castilla, he might make a move this summer already, with Alav\u00e9s apparently being highly interested.\n\n**My rating:** 6.5/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** maybe\n\n**Next season:** transfer/Castilla starter\n\n\u00a0\n\n**#29 Mario Rivas - CB - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - 2007**\n\n**30 matches - 2658 minutes (77.7%) - 1 assist**\n\nMario Rivas is one of Ra\u00fal's chosen ones, one of the players he just picks out of the younger ranks one day, and sticks with him, like Mario Mart\u00edn and \u00c1lvaro Rodr\u00edguez before him. Despite his young age, he was the mainstay in the center of Castilla's defense, mainly obviously because injuries in the first team prevented Asencio and Jacobo from playing more minutes with Castilla - but despite his young age, he was absolutely solid with some genuinely great performances in the second half of that season. Although he struggles with the physicality of Primera Federaci\u00f3n and could be more daring in his defending sometimes, he still plays with nice composure and conficence for his age. Next season, he will surely be part of Castilla again, although he will have much fiercer competition at center back than before.\n\n**My rating:** 7.5/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** maybe\n\n**Next season:** Castilla squad\n\n\u00a0\n\n**#37 V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as - LB/CB - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - 2006**\n\n**14 matches - 439 minutes (12.8%) - 1 goal**\n\n\"Valde\" was a regular sub option for Ra\u00fal in the final part of the season, both at LCB and LB. He was quite convincing in the minutes he got, offering a good balance, confident on the ball with some drive in attack, scoring his first Castilla goal, while also being solid defensively since he is naturally a center back. Normally, he would be a safe bet to get promoted to Castilla next season, but his contract is apparently running out this summer, and with teams like Arsenal and Dortmund apparently interested, he could also be leaving the club.\n\n**My rating:** \\--/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** maybe\n\n**Next season:** transfer/Castilla squad\n\n\u00a0\n\n**#38 Diego Aguado - LB/CB - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - 2006**\n\n**2 matches - 24 minutes (0.7%)**\n\nJuvenil A's defensive leader Diego Aguado got subbed on as a left back in two matches for Castilla this season. In the end, he played more minutes for the first team (90) than for Castilla this season, but his performances for Juvenil A were exceptional, and I'm very excited to see what Arbeloa does with him in Castilla next season, and if he sees him as a left back or center back.\n\n**My rating:** \\-/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** maybe\n\n**Next season:** Castilla squad\n\n\u00a0\n\n**#41 Manu Serrano - LB/CB - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - 2004**\n\n**1 matches - 5 minutes (0.1%)**\n\nManu Serrano got rewarded for his performances for Real Madrid C with a 5 minute cameo on the final matchday. I don't see him fit to be promoted to Castilla, so if he doesn't want to play for Real Madrid C for yet another season, he'd need to leave the club.\n\n**My rating:** \\-/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** no\n\n**Next season:** transfer\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zunxp8fcz45f1.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0dda03ac3a3d5dec1e6426e48e2f30868ac21a54\n\n**#6 Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Andr\u00e9s 'Chema' - CDM - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - 2005**\n\n**32 matches - 2737 minutes (80%) - 1 red card**\n\nChema was a strong presence in Castilla's midfield all throughout the season, his impressive physique and qualities on the ball being very important to the balance of the team. However, I think his season was pretty hit or miss - he caused the team to concede goals multiple times with errors in the buildup play in the first half of the season, and due to his slow pace, he consistently arrives late in challenges, leading to him getting caught out in devensive transitions and getting 14 yellow cards and one red card throughout the season. He needs to be more aware of his surroundings, both in situations where the opponent presses high and where the team is in danger of getting attacked on the counter. Nonetheless, it was a overall a decent first season for Castilla for him, getting rewarded with some short appearances for the first team, and he will play an important part of Castilla next season again.\n\n**My rating:** 6/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** maybe\n\n**Next season:** Castilla starter\n\n\u00a0\n\n**#8 Manuel \u00c1ngel - CM - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - 2004**\n\n**17 match - 1152 minutes (33.7%) - 2 assists - 1 red card**\n\nCastilla's captain had a rather disappointing season, riddled with smaller and recurring injuries from the very start. Whenever he played it was obvious he is the most technically gifted midfielder Castilla has, but he struggled with the physicality and pace of the division on a variety of occasions, struggling to find rhythm after his injuries. I still think Ra\u00fal doesn't utilise him in the best way, but Arbeloa will definitely change that as it's well known he's one of his absolutely favourite players. He will be Castilla's captain and Arbeloa's right hand man on the pitch next season, and I hope he develops well so maybe Xabi sees him as a solution in the first team's midfield too after Modri\u0107's departure.\n\n**My rating:** 5.5/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** maybe\n\n**Next season:** Castilla starter + captain\n\n\u00a0\n\n**#10 C\u00e9sar Palacios - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - CAM - 2004**\n\n**4 matches - 92 minutes (2.7%)**\n\nAfter his tragic ACL injury in the first team summer pre-season, he was sidelined for almost the entire season. He returned to the matchday squads a couple of weeks ago, and has made 4 appearances off the bench, instantly showing glimpses of his quality again, especially on the last matchday where he could or should have had a goal and an assist. Next season, he will most likely be a key part of the team, depending on how he recovers from his injury.\n\n**My rating:** \\-/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** unlikely\n\n**Next season:** Castilla starter\n\n\u00a0\n\n**#16 Antonio David - CDM - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - 2005**\n\n**27 matches - 1079 minutes (31.5%)**\n\nAntonio David, another Real Madrid C regular from last season, surprisingly made the Castilla squad through lack of other options in the summer. He was Chema's backup in defensive midfield, and started whenever he was injured, suspended or needed some rest. He doesn't have the physical presence or the quality on the ball of Chema, but he was mostly solid when called upon, never making any grave errors. Age-wise, he could continue with Castilla for another season, but I don't think he has enough quality or talent for us to build on, especially with other, promising defensive midfielders coming up, like Cristian David, Jorge Cestero or Izan Regueira.\n\n**My rating:** 5/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** no\n\n**Next season:** transfer/Castilla backup\n\n\u00a0\n\n**#20 Andr\u00e9s Campos - CAM - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - 2002**\n\n**17 matches - 617 minutes (18%) - 1 assist**\n\nPromoting a 2002-born player who had a decent, but not exceptional season for Real Madrid C to Castilla was the epitome of the disappointing squad planning at the start of the season. And even though many of the players exceeded expectations, Campos was not one of those. He was a regular attacking sub for Ra\u00fal, but didn't provide much danger or dynamism off the bench, provided no goals or assists, and even though he played over 600 minutes, I can't remember more than a handful of memorable plays he made this season. Next season, he should definitely leave, if not for his level, then definitely for his age.\n\n**My rating:** 3/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** no\n\n**Next season:** transfer\n\n\u00a0\n\n**#26 Hugo de Llanos - CAM (RW) - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - 2005**\n\n**16 matches - 895 minutes (26.2%) - 2 goals**\n\nAfter his amazing 34G+A season with Juvenil A, he was supposed to be the highest quality addition to Castilla's attack wirh the lack of external signings. So, he got lots of minutes at the start of the season, but sadly, he was mostly a non-factor apart from a brace against dead-last Intercity. He was very timid and inefficient in the minutes he played, and Ra\u00fal quickly dropped him from the squad entirely, so he went down to Real Madrid C to help them stay up, successfully so. He will get another shot at Castilla with Arbeloa for sure next season.\n\n**My rating:** 3.5/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** unlikely\n\n**Next season:** Castilla squad\n\n\u00a0\n\n**#27 Pol Fortuny - CAM (RW) - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - 2005**\n\n**25 matches - 1918 minutes (56.1%) - 1 goal, 8 assists**\n\nPol Fortuny had just returned from his unfortunate ACL injury at the end of last season, when he had an amazing U19s Euro, being one of the key players for Spain with 3 assists in 3 group stage matches and the winning goal in added time in the semi-final. The level he demonstrated made it impossible not to promote him to Castilla, even though he was officially registered with Real Madrid C. Even though he did struggle a bit with the physicality of senior football and was not really able to advance into the box and drive towards goal, he was the main creative outlet of the team, feeding passes to the more physical Gonzalo and V\u00edctor with his elegant left foot. He ended the season with 8 assists, being the team's top assister. Next season, he will surely play an important role for Castilla again\n\n**My rating:** 7.5/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** unlikely\n\n**Next season:** Castilla starter\n\n\u00a0\n\n**#33 Cristian David - CDM - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf4 - 2005**\n\n**4 matches - 158 minutes (4.6%) - 1 assist**\n\nI expected Cristian David to have a bigger role with Castilla this season after being Arbeloa's captain last season in Juvenil A, but he was busy helping Real Madrid C barely scrape by in Segunda Federaci\u00f3n. In the end, he started one match and was subbed on in 3 more, but I'm sure Arbeloa will bring him along with him to Castilla next season.\n\n**My rating:** \\-/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** maybe\n\n**Next season:** Castilla squad\n\n\u00a0\n\n**#39 Bruno Iglesias - CAM - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - 2003**\n\n**1 match - 7 minutes (0.2%)**\n\nBruno's tragic story got a new chapter this season - to the surprise of everyone, he was called up once this season by Ra\u00fal against Alcoyano, and Ra\u00fal, the coach that basically banished him from Castilla, stopping the meteoric rise of the former supertalent, actually subbed him on for his Castilla comeback, more than two years later. But the nice, full-circle-moment story ends here, because after he stepped on the pitch, he played one pass, slipped and injured his shoulder, leading to him getting subbed off again and being sidelined a couple of weeks. This summer, as much as there's a small part of me that hopes he gets a final chance under Arbeloa, he will certainly leave the club as his contract is running out.\n\n**My rating:** \\-/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** no\n\n**Next season:** transfer\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/033i6r2ez45f1.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f42d8a3964b1f7d95fa82a9cc948252b2d176a27\n\n**#7 Gonzalo Garc\u00eda - LW (ST) - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - 2004**\n\n**36 matches - 3186 minutes (93.2%) - 25 goals - 4 assists**\n\nEven though he had disappointing season with Castilla in 2023/24, scoring just 5 goals, everyone that followed him the year before, where he scored 35 goals for Juvenil A, knew that Gonzalo was a goal-scoring machine waiting to be awakened. And that's exactly what Ra\u00fal managed to do, making Gonzalo the focal point of the attack. Unlike in past seasons, he didn't switch between positions throughout the season, but still his versatility saw him score from all sorts of situations, headers, penalties, tap-ins, shots from distance, or cutting inside from the left wing and scoring after a nice run. His vast skillset made him unstoppable for most defences in Primera Federaci\u00f3n, and he ended up with 25 goals, which is a new record in Primera Federaci\u00f3n and equals Mariano's record of goals in one Castilla season. He got well deserved minutes for the first team as well where he was just as convincing, scoring the winner against Legan\u00e9s in Copa del Rey and providing an assist for Bellingham against Valencia. His goals made Castilla sail smoothly through a season with a huge amount of injuries, no signings, a shaky defense and a lack of quality and experience throughout the team. Clubs from all over Europe will be after him in summer, but maybe he could be a valuable part of the first team if we don't sign a striker like Budimir.\n\n**My rating:** 9.5/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** maybe\n\n**Next season:** transfer/Castilla starter + first team minutes\n\n\u00a0\n\n**#9 V\u00edctor Mu\u00f1oz - RW - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - 2003**\n\n**34 matches - 2742 minutes (80.2%) - 11 goals, 7 assist**\n\nV\u00edctor was always insanely quick, showing flashes of his talent here and there, but before this season, he was an average talent, if even that - having little to no impact off the bench for Castilla last season. This season however, he developed all aspects of his game, has a great eye for both the goal and his teammates, great crossing technique, good finishing (I know, I know, why didn't he show that against Bar\u00e7a...) and was a key part of Castilla's success this season. When Gonzalo went through a drought in early spring, he was the team's main source of danger, and his performance against Recreativo away, with 2 goals and 2 assists, one prettier than the other, was among the best if not the single best individual performances I've ever seen by a Castilla player. Ra\u00fal's fast, counter-attacking setup was perfect for him to shine, and V\u00edctor got rewarded with well-deserved first team minutes at the end of the season, which I wouldn't have believed if you told me at the start of the season. I assume first and second division clubs will be after him, so it's to be seen if he stays at the club.\n\n**My rating:** 8.5/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** maybe\n\n**Next season:** transfer/Castilla starter\n\n\u00a0\n\n**\u200b#11 Borja Alonso - RW - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - 2004**\n\n**17 matches - 807 minutes (23.6%) - 4 assists**\n\nBorja got rewarded with promotion to Castilla after a good season with Real Madrid C. He started on the first two matchdays, then got a grave injury that kept him out from August to January. When he returned, Ra\u00fal mostly used him as an attacking sub with V\u00edctor having the right wing spot locked down, and he showed some promise every now and then, putting in some lovely crosses and providing 4 assists in the second half of the season. He will probably play another season with Castilla, but it's not completely certain with a different coach in Arbeloa coming in.\n\n**My rating:** 5.5/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** no\n\n**Next season:** Castilla squad/transfer\n\n\u00a0\n\n**\u200b#19 Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga - ST - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddf6 - 2003**\n\n**27 matches - 1444 minutes (42.2%) - 5 goals - 2 assists - 1 red card**\n\nLoren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga was basically the team's only real number 9 this season, so he started the season off as a starter at the striker position. He didn't really succeed at his main task of scoring goals, so he was quickly dropped to the bench, then missed a few months with injury. When he returned, he was mostly a sub option, and after he got a really stupid double-yellow against Atl\u00e9tico B, I thought Ra\u00fal wouldn't bother with him anymore, but quite on the contrary, he finished the season with a good stretch of matches, scoring 3 and assisting 1 while always playing from the beginning. Due to his age, he could leave the club this summer, or maybe play another season at Castilla since there are not many other striker options at the club right now.\n\n**My rating:** 6/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** no\n\n**Next season:** transfer/Castilla squad\n\n\u00a0\n\n**\u200b#21 Jeremy de Le\u00f3n - RW - \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf7 - 2004**\n\n**4 matches - 39 minutes (1.1%)**\n\nOur \"talisman\" in the 2024 UCL win does still not have any sporting relevance at the club after his first full season. He was nothing more than an emergency sub at the start of the season, injured his shoulder, came back, and then somehow severely injured his other shoulder, leading him to need surgery that kept him out for the remainder of the season. Let's see if he gives it another go next season, I assume he will be a backup for Castilla once he recovers fully.\n\n**My rating:** \\-/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** no\n\n**Next season:** Castilla squad/transfer\n\n\u00a0\n\n**\u200b#32 \u00c1ngel Carvajal - ST - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - 2004**\n\n**1 matches - 19 minutes (0.6%)**\n\n**My rating:** \\-/10\n\nRM C's \u00c1ngel Carvajal was brought on for the last 20 minutes on MD2 to rescue some points against Valencia. After that, he was called up with Castilla two more times, but didn't feature again. He could leave the club next season or spend another season with Real Madrid C.\n\n**Future at Madrid:** no\n\n**Next season:** transfer/Real Madrid C squad\n\n\u00a0\n\n**#35 Jacobo Ortega - ST - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - 2006**\n\n**1 match - 5 minutes (0.1%)**\n\nJacobo was subbed on in the dying minutes once due to lack of other options. Real Madrid C's main striker will probably play there for another season.\n\n**My rating:** \\-/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** no\n\n**Next season:** Real Madrid C starter\n\n\u00a0\n\n**#36 Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez - RW - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 - 2006**\n\n**13 matches - 272 minutes (8%) - 1 goal**\n\nDani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez was rewarded for his clutch performances with Juvenil A in the earlier part of the season both with a very short appearance for the first team as with some call-ups and minutes for Castilla, and eventually became a regular sub for Ra\u00fal. He managed to score his first Castilla goal, but he could not yet translate his performances from the youth levels to senior football yet. I think going back and forth between Castilla and Juvenil A really took some momentum and rhythm out of his season with the U19s too. Next season, I expect Arbeloa to take him along with him to Castilla.\n\n**My rating:** \\-/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** maybe\n\n**Next season:** Castilla squad\n\n\u00a0\n\n**\u200b#40 Baba Diocou - RW - \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddf3 - 2005**\n\n**4 matches - 39 minutes (1.1%)**\n\nBaba got some short cameos throughout the season, very surprising to me since he is not even an important player for Real Madrid C. I can't remember him doing anything of note in the little time he spent on the pitch for Castilla. Next season, he might leave the club, or play another season with Real Madrid C.\n\n**My rating:** \\-/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** no\n\n**Next season:** Real Madrid C squad\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q7083q3jz45f1.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=973461cc40b35a6f90a268c888b1966baddcce6c\n\n**Coach - Ra\u00fal Gonz\u00e1lez - \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8**\n\nPeople who follow my Castilla content know that I haven't always been fond of Ra\u00fal as a coach, that I had lots of things to criticise and couldn't understand various of the decisions he made throughout his 6 years of coaching Castilla, but this season, I said from the very first moment - if Castilla fail to hold the division, it will be through no fault of his, as he was left with a very imbalanced squad that quite apparently lacked quality and experience. Multiple important players like Nico, \u00c1lvaro, Obrador, Marvel, Carrillo, Vini Tob\u00edas left the team, and the club didn't make any signings to replace them. The squad was filled up with players from Juvenil A (de Llanos, Youssef, Fran Gonz\u00e1lez etc.), who had a pretty disappointing season and lack senior football experience, and players from Real Madrid C (Campos, Antonio David, David Jim\u00e9nez etc.), who were just promoted from the 5th into the 4th division. As expected, the team struggled a lot in the first half of the season, consistently placing in the relegation spots, even dropping down to last place temporarily. The team was naive in defense, had no urgency and definition in attack, and at one point, I was certain the team would inevitably get relegated if the club made no winter signings. The club didn't make any winter signings, but instead, Ra\u00fal worked with what he had, set the team up to play simple and precise football on the counter, finally no weird positional experiments anymore, all of which made players like Gonzalo and V\u00edctor literally explode in their performances while Castilla turned into a cold-blooded goalscoring machine, finishing the league with the highest amount of goals scored. The defense, while still being shaky and naive at times and making costly errors in tighter matches, also became more stable with the return of Jacobo Ram\u00f3n, Ra\u00fals decision to put de Luis back between the goalposts, and, I know it sounds weird, but also the de facto-promotion of Asencio to the first team. They finished 6th, just outside the playoff spots, which was nothing short of a miraculous turnaround after fighting relegation throughout the entire first half of the season. The team only lost a single match in 2025. After all, with the conditions set by the club at the start of the season, this season was more than succesful for Ra\u00fal and his boys, and this season honestly might have been one of his best as a coach so far, turning the extremely dire situation around in this way has left me hugely impressed. As bad as the first half of the season was, the end was a more than conciliatory ending to his time as Castilla's coach, and I'm very excited to see where he goes next.\n\n**My rating:** 8/10\n\n**Future at Madrid:** unlikely\n\n**Next season:** ?",

She's been wanting to leave her club Tigres for a while now it feels like. But she's a winger and I'm worried what that will mean for Athenea or Linda Caicedo. I frankly think Real Madrid don't need her and I don't think she'll come to Real Madrid just to sit on the bench. Especially since it looks like she's the centerpiece for Tigres. ",

He returned from injury in the closing stages of this season, in Real Madrid C. I assume this was for administrative and registration reasons. \n\n\nDoes anyone know if he played any games there? What was his form? From what I\u2019m gathering, we do not expect him to be part of first team setup for next season. Maybe he\u2019ll play for Castilla for a year, since he\u2019s still 17. \n\n\nI have high hopes for him to be a great Real Madrid player, and appreciate any insight you guys might have.\n\nCheers!",
