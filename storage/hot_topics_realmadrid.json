But wow, I had NO IDEA how expensive tickets are\u2014even for games that aren\u2019t considered big matchups!\n\nI\u2019m planning to fly to Madrid in the first week of April, hoping to catch the home game against Valencia. Based on what I\u2019ve read online, my best option seems to be getting tickets from reselling platforms like StubHub. However, the prices are shocking\u2014an above-average ticket costs at least \u20ac400 on every resale site I\u2019ve come across in this subreddit.\n\nInitially, I was also hoping to grab a cheaper below-average ticket if Madrid make it to the UCL semi-finals on April 8th or 9th, just to experience the magic of the Bernab\u00e9u on a Champions League night. But seeing how expensive resale tickets are even for the Valencia game, I\u2019m starting to doubt if that\u2019ll be possible.\n\nIf anyone has tips on how international fans can find tickets at more reasonable prices, I\u2019d be so grateful!",

        "content": "Hey Madridistas!\n\nI came across a discussion in the r/ChampionsLeague subreddit about the three clutchest players in the history of the competition. The answers were a bit mixed, but I wanted to ask this question here in our community, since we have so many clutch players who have left a massive impact on the tournament.\n\nWho would you consider the top three clutchest players in Champions League history?\n\nNot the most clutch players, but in our current squad, I consider Rodrygo, Vini and Courtois to be very clutch as they seem to perform even better when the stakes are highest.",

        "content": "Hello! I'm not sure if this is the right place for this, I've never posted anything on Reddit before. I need help or actually some tips for getting tickets. I want to surprise my boyfriend (life long Real Madrid fan) with tickets to the Real Madrid : Atletico Madrid match in February as it coincides with his birthday and he's never seen them in person.\n\nWhat are even the chances of getting these tickets ahead of time online as it's a big match. And my other question is - are VIP tickets worth it? I am contemplating getting VIPs,  if they are available earlier than regular tickets as I also have to organise plane tickets and a hotel as we have to fly in from a different country. I also paid some premium membership (35 EUR/year) type of a deal on the official website as it was quite cheap and they advertised one of the perks was earlier or easier access to tickets? What are your experiences with this?\n\nThank you so much for all the help and answers and sorry if this is not the right place for this kind of a post.\n\nX",

        "content": "Real Madrid have an insanely packed calendar up ahead with potentially 12 games in just over a month. That\u2019s just over 3 days per game on average. I hope Ancelotti rotates where necessary and that injuries do not occur (although seeing our luck so far this season, I\u2019m kinda nervous). Below are the next possible 12 games if we advance in all the cup rounds:\n\n5 LaLiga Matches:\n\n- January 3: Valencia away (rescheduled from earlier in the season)\n- January 18/19: Las Palmas at home\n- January but 25/26: Real Valladolid away\n- February 1/2: Espanyol away\n- February 8/9: Atl\u00e9tico Madrid at home\n\n3 Copa del Rey Matches:\n\n- January 6: Round of 32 against Deportiva Minera\n- January 14/15/16: Potential Round of 16 match\n- February 4/5/6: Potential Quarter-final match \n\n2 Spanish Supercopa Matches:\n\n- January 9: Semi-final against Mallorca in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\n- January 12: Potential Final against Barcelona or Athletic Club \n\n2 UEFA Champions League:\n\n- January 22: RB Salzburg at home\n- January 29: Brest away\n\nIn total, if Real Madrid wins all their matches and advances in each competition, we could play up to 12 matches between now and February 9! Hala Madrid!!",
