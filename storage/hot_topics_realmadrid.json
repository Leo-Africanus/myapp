Even in 23-24, we ran less than nearly all of our knockout stage opponents . \n\nWe could still win because Kroos/Modric could take pressure and switch flanks to with young players who are willing to make runs and help them defend. But now it's different and I think it's a big problem of last season. We could no longer pass and dictate the tempo better, and we ran less so we can't win. Not sure will Xabi help improve it.",

Ticket sale hasn't opened yet, only the VIP is (no tickets available anymore apparently, is that permanent tho? Could any VIP tickets show up later?). I'm mainly looking at the official website and entradas com website.\n\nI know that tickets open almost a week before the game kick-off date. For the Madridista premium members, ticket sale opens one day before the general public category. I'm wondering if this would give me more chances to find a ticket than waiting for the general public tickets.\n\nThanks!!",
