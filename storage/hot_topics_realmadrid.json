        "content": "#FT: H\u00c9RCULES 1:1 CASTILLA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#1\u00aa FEDERACI\u00d3N\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:** \n\n1:0 Oriol Soldevila 16'\n\n1:1 Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga 90'+4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - kickoff, vamos!  \n\n13' - great save by de Luis on a shot from outside the box, then Rivas clears it last second to prevent the rebound\n\n\u26bd 16' - goal for H\u00e9rcules, cross from the right side and with his back turned to our goal, Soldevila heads it on amazingly for it to go over de Luis and into the opposite corner \n\nHT - Castilla were under huge pressure at the beginning of the first half and deservingly conceded  the first goal. They slowly started improving throughout the half, although they didn't create enough danger yet\n\n46' - 2nd half underway \n\n\ud83d\udd04 58' - first sub, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga for Campos\n\n\ud83d\udd04 79' - Pol Fortuny and Jeremy for Manuel \u00c1ngel and Edgar\n\n\ud83d\udd04 89' - David Jim\u00e9nez has discomfort and Loren Aguado replaces him \n\n\u26bd 90'+4 - GOLLLL DEL CASTILLA - phenomenal cross by Yusi, who whips the ball in from the left touchline all the way onto Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga's head - he heads it past former Castilla player Abad in H\u00e9rcules' goal for the late equaliser! \n\nFT - Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga's equaliser in added time keeps Castilla's unbeaten run in 2025 alive - although it was now the 3rd draw in a row. The team was overwhelmed in the first half, committing easy errors in possession against H\u00e9rcules' press, and quickly conceded the 0:1. They tried to find solutions as they gained more and more control over the match, but failed to create danger for the most part until Yusi's brilliant cross found Loren's head. It wasn't a very convincing performance by Castilla, but even if it came late, the draw is the deserved result over 90 minutes \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 20:30 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Jos\u00e9 Rico P\u00e9rez, Alicante\n\n**Referee**: \n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 2, Matchday 28\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[FEF TV](https://feftv.com) (subscription - 12.99\u20ac/month)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (5-3-2): Mario de Luis - Youssef Enr\u00edquez \u2018Yusi\u2019, Edgar Pujol (79' Jeremy de Le\u00f3n), Jacobo Ram\u00f3n, Mario Rivas, David Jim\u00e9nez (89' Lorenzo Aguado) - Jos\u00e9 Maria Andr\u00e9s \u2018Chema\u2019, Manuel \u00c1ngel (79' Pol Fortuny), Andr\u00e9s Campos (58' Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga) - Gonzalo Garc\u00eda, V\u00edctor Mu\u00f1oz \n\nBench: Diego Pi\u00f1eiro (GK), David Ruiz, Antonio David, Borja Alonso.\n\nUnavailable: Fran Gonz\u00e1lez (first team call-up), Ra\u00fal Asencio (first team call-up), Quique Ribes (?), David Cuenca (pubalgia), C\u00e9sar Palacios (ACL tear). \n\nCoach: Ra\u00fal\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** WDWDD\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 7th | 38pt | 9-11-7 | 44:29\n",

One time there was even a beach ball thrown on the pitch when our player was going to take a corner. There were even some spectators who spat on Courtois as well as Mbappe. Even Llorente was about to kick the ball after failing at taking a penalty. It was good that Mbappe intervened but why was only Mbappe shown Yellow and why not Llorente since he was about to disrupt the game itself. After the match, the ugly tone and intimidation of Simeone at the post-match press conference asking Journalists to raise their hands if anyone thought if there's a double touch from Alvarez?? This is utter hooliganism from Atletico Staff &amp; Management, Atletico played at our stadium as well in first leg but we get to witness a good game without any fuss/nuisance. This aggressive behaviour from Atletico staff/management/spectators should be shunned immediately else its going to take a far more dark turn very soon.\n\nUEFA should've also sanctioned Atletico players, staff as well as spectators who indulged in all these ugly affairs the other day? What was that ambiguous statement from UEFA regarding penalty call, saying they'll discuss with FIFA/IFAB about removing the rules where touch was unintentional. How are they sure about that?",

        "title": "Uefa's absurd press release",
        "content": "UEFA said that they were looking into the rules so that when the double touch is clearly unintentional, the penalty should stand even if there is a double touch.\n\nThe thing is: when is it ever intentional? How many INTENTIONAL double touches of a penalty kick can you show?\n\nAre we also going to not consider own-goals as goals as well? They're always unintentional as well. Why not disallow own goals as well?\n\nIt is an absurd statement and it is only made to try and paint real madrid as benefiting from a misapplication of the rule.",
