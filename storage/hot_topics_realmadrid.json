        "content": "Hello to all the so called real fans.\n\nI used to come here all the time, checking the Real Madrid subreddit for the latest club news, updates about injured players, or simply to discuss matches with you. Lately though, I get irritated the moment I see what some of you are posting, and I honestly start wondering whether some of you are actually Barcelona fans in disguise, trying to create chaos here.\n\nAll I see are absurd questions like: would we be better without Mbapp\u00e9? Or would Kane have been a better option instead? It feels like no matter how well the Frenchman performs, you still find reasons to go after him and criticize him.\n\nLast season you were glorifying Valverde and Jude, and now, almost overnight, you have turned your backs on them and want them replaced or sold. You complain nonstop about the state of the club as if you personally invested money and are now losing it because of the players. I have even seen attacks directed at P\u00e9rez. Fine, maybe we do not agree with every single decision he makes, but can we seriously not appreciate what we have? After P\u00e9rez is gone, you will all regret it, but by then it will be too late.\n\nThis subreddit is dominated by frustration, anger, and regret. Very few people actually stand by the players and the coach. Even fewer show real compassion and genuine love for the biggest football club in the world.\n\nReal Madrid, like any other team, goes through weaker periods. But because many of you are spoiled little bitches who grew up with Champions League trophies, Ballon d\u2019Or winners, and league titles almost every year, the moment things get difficult, instead of acting like real supporters, you rush to Reddit to post all kinds of nonsense.\n\nI genuinely think many of you have forgotten who Real Madrid really are. And that happens because some of you are here only for appearances, or because you support a single player rather than the team as a whole.\n\nIt is time for all of us to show that we are true Real Madrid supporters, because being a true fan of this club is a privilege. Hala Madrid!",

And people don\u2019t realize how hard is that, and obviously some people forget that apparently half of the squad is injured and still demanding the SAME results. \n\nThis is a transition stage, after any major success or dominance for a club, things has to change around, and usually the transition stage doesn\u2019t come with the most appealing results, and therefore creating a rage among some fans who can\u2019t handle the fact that losing is part of this game and start booing on the manager to sack him and get zidane. \n\nFYI, i dont think zidane will come, at least in the near future, the guy is dedicated to his NT , And obviously getting him till the end of the season will only mess things more.\n\nWe need a solid foundation, we need to trust the manager this season even if the result aren\u2019t the best. And give him the required time for any manager to deal with those stars, injuries, media.\n\n",

        "content": "Reported by Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz (Tier 2).\n\nP.S. The cited texts are automatically translated. In the title, \"delantero\" should be more accurately \"forward\", not \"striker\".\n\nP.S. There is a similar post of the same source, but it altered the title.\n\nThe reason for Vini's drop in form is \"he hasn't quite reached his full physical potential\".\n\n&gt; The Brazilian, true to form, tried everything [against Man City], but luck wasn't on his side.\n\n&gt; He [Vini] has no doubt about it [regaining his form], nor about the club's constant support. There is no distance whatsoever between the management and the player.\n\nFlurries of weird statements from a journalist. Almost like Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz is a fanboy. But if you imagine these words said in Vini and his entourage's tone, everything makes sense.\n\n&gt; ## Seal the continuity\n\n&gt; The two parties,\u00a0player and president, maintain an excellent relationship and are in constant communication. In these conversations, they have discussed the future and the possibility of\u00a0a new agreement\u00a0that would secure the Brazilian's continued presence at Real Madrid.\n\n&gt; Vinicius has made it clear in recent matches that his understanding with Xabi Alonso is palpable after weeks of tension following the Cl\u00e1sico and the Brazilian's gestures, for which he apologized. Since then, the Brazilian has been untouchable for the coach. His willingness to try is something no one can doubt. He does it time and time again, and the first to know that the striker's streak will change is Xabi Alonso himself.\n\nAnother piece leaked by Vini's agent. The closest thing you get from an apology to Alonso.\n\nSo it looks like Vini's open to renewal again while Alonso remains the coach.\n\n&gt; Since then, the Brazilian has been untouchable for the coach.\n\nCan you believe this sentence is part of evidence that Vini and Alonso have repaired their relationship?",

A loan move, some may say made out of desperation after the failed Nico deal.\n\nI\u2019ll tell you why. Flick understands the strengths and weaknesses of Rashford and plays him to those strengths. That\u2019s it. The responsibility of a manager isn\u2019t just to explain tactics on a board. It\u2019s also to man manage, to manage egos and confidence. It\u2019s extremely naive to expect a team full of world class players to also have perfect personalities. I\u2019ll make it abundantly clear, I\u2019m not suggesting that the blame falls fully on xabi for our performances this season but I will say it\u2019s extremely naive to suggest that it all comes down to \u201cego\u201d, \u201cselfishness\u201d, \u201cnot working hard enough\u201d.",

One said he is a match-winner Number 10 and his goal scoring threat will be subdued if he is pushed back to being a box 2 box midfielder with additional possession building duties. Said he can also press and steal balls brilliantly in the final third using his pace and strength.\n\nOther one said Jude is a natural box to box midfielder and large part of his game is build on covering each blade of the grass , dealing with pressing and shielding the centre backs. At 10, the game passes by him and he hardly gets to use his best assets. Moreover, he loves to take his time in progressing the game and carrying the ball forward. 10 is too crowded for him and doesn\u2019t let his size come into play nor his durability.\n\nAnother point of discussion was his best partners - Whether Camavinga, Tchouameni and Valverde really compliment him and the common consensus was that one of the three should be benched for a possession building midfielder(Vitinha or Pedri or FDJ type) next season and Jude will cook the best with Trent AA at RB.",

        "title": "Do you want us to be structured or free flowing offensively ?",
        "content": "This question is purely from an offensive point of view in the final third.\n\nThis question has been running through my mind since the Celta game when the commentator mentioned **\"When you are structured, you are easier to defend, bcs you are predictable\"**. This does have a good value. In the premier league, the big boys have a tough game against brighton/brentford. Brentford are very transitional and hard for the possession hogging teams. Brighton has an insane structural play(especially during De Zerbi) and consistently outplayed Pep and Klopp. What this also tells is, **a structured team can be beaten by another structure.**\n\n  \nThis also correlates to the fact that madrid has won more UCLs over the last decade than the structured teams. Structured teams usually are good with the ball, but aren't as good without the ball when there is chaos(AKA Madrid). This makes me wonder, should we really want to be like them ? From a defensive POV, yes. From a pressing POV, yes. But do we need to be them in the final third. I'd prefer us to have a combination of both. I'd like more overlapping runs being used by our forwards, more low crosses, more third man runs. These keep us unpredictable, other than Vini/Kylian cutting in right now. These wil make the defenders track other players more, creating more space for the frontline attackers. What are your thoughts on this ?",

        "content": "When we look under at underying data, from understat and fbref, we can find that they deserved more points than they have won. Only bayern are above them in big 5 leagues in xGD. We are good at chance creation. We are underperforming on xG because of wastefullness in front of goal from other players other mbappe. Also mbappe eventhough scored some bangers, having the most outside box goals, he also missed some sitters. I think xabi deserves atleast one year and vinicius has to be sold if dont renew and get a creative left winger with a high floor like yildiz or semenyo. If we get an organizer with like locatelli, who is under the radar in january and incoperate endrick into the side, we can win the league and go deep in the champions league. \nThe most important thing xabi has to improve is the in-game management especially the substitutes. Hoping for the better. All this injuries may be a good thing as we can see the players who have'nt plated that much on where they stand.",

Joan and Valde hugely missed due to the injury crisis with the first team\n\n\u26bd 45'+4 - GOLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - corner from the left side taken short - Mesonero advances into the box with technique and willpower and lays it off to David - he wants to take a low cross towards the first post, but it gets deflected by Guadalajara's Calvo into his own net \n\nHT - the absence of so many players due to the (yearly...) injury crisis in both Castilla and the first team is duly noted, especially the centre of defense between Rivas and Fati is looking very disoriented - but Castilla manage to equalise with the last kick and salvage a difficult first half\n\n\ud83d\udd04 46' - 2nd half underway, with Arbeloa trying to stabilise the defence by subbing on left back Lezcano for his Castilla debut for Mario Rivas, moving Diego Aguado to center back\n\n\ud83d\udfe5 47' - second yellow card for Guadalajara's To\u00f1o Calvo, who crowns his nightmare performance with a stupid foul on Palacios, already being on a yellow -harsh decision but not scandalous\n\n\n\u26bd 49' - GOOOOLLLL DEL CASTILLA - Golazo de Mesonero! He receives the ball in midfield with a lot of space, drives towards the box and takes a shot from distance, surprising the keeper low at the near post\n\n\u26bd 61' - GOOOOLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - huge misunderstanding in Guadalajara's defence after a long clearance by Castilla - their defender heads the ball past the keeper who was storming out of the goal, and Z\u00fa\u00f1iga only has to pick it up and tap it into the empty net! \n\n\ud83d\udd04 63' - Mesonero comes off after a MOTM performance alongside Palacios, coming in in their stead are Beto for his Castilla debut and Pol Fortuny\n\n\ud83d\udd04 70' - Fortea comes on for David\n\n\ud83d\udd04 77' - and the last sub, Castrelo on for Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga\n\n90' - penalty for Castilla after Manuel \u00c1ngel is brought down in the box \n\n90'+4 - after almost 5 minutes of reviewing, the referee overturns it - another correct decision by her imo, way too little of a touch on our player \n\nFT - Castilla with a second half of suffocating dominance and great dynamism from everyone including the debuting players - which is also partly thanks to Guadalajara being their own worst enemy, scoring an own goal out of nowhere, getting an early red card in the second half and gifting us the third goal on top.
