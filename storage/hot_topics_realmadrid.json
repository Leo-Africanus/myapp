        "content": "To me stiller is the best young match in modern football to be out engine. Zubimendi is great, but he is a more defensive 6, whereas stiller has great progressive passes, way more touches and passes during a game and way more assists.\n\nHe also still has 6.3 recoveries per game and around 90% pass completion. He can pass long, short and medium and does well under pressure.\n\nZubimendi is a better dribbler, wich is how he remains possession often(it also slows the game down). He is a better defender and probably slightly more tactically aware. I do not think he is much of an upgrade to tchouameni/camavinga on the 6. I would compare him most to Busquets, and our style doesnt rly need that.\n\nStiller offers pace setting, passing and a link between defense and offense. \nZubimendi offers stability trough smart positioning and robust defending.\n\nWhat do you all think?",
