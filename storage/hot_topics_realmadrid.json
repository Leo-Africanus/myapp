Still everything to decide in the second half, but Castilla needs to be more daring in possession\n\n\ud83d\udd04 46' - second half underway with one substitution for Castilla, Cristian David comes off for Pol Fortuny\n\n\u26bd 55' - GOLLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - free kick from deep, curled into the box by Pol Fortuny - Cestero is free at the near post and taps it past the keeper for the lead! \n\n\u26bd 59' - GOLLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - long ball by Joan to Fortea on the right wing - he waits for support by Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez, who gets the ball, takes one touch, then curls it perfectly into the far bottom corner, golazo \n\n\ud83d\udd04 68' - Valdepe\u00f1as and Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga come on for Aguado and Y\u00e1\u00f1ez\n\n70' - penalty call for Lugo, Arbeloa uses the new challenge system (every coach has 2 per match) and it gets reviewed, for me, it's not enough , just a shoulder block by Lamini against their player - on second glance, he does hit him at the legs too - the question now is if the foul was inside the area\n\n74' - the referee gives the penalty after the review \n\n\u26bd 74' - ex-Mallorca player Lago Junior, who already scored against our first team a few years ago, steps up and converts the penalty - just 2:1 now\n\n77' - yellow card for Joan after a clear but necessary tactical foul \n\n\ud83d\udd04 81' - Bruno Iglesias comes on for Roberto Mart\u00edn, who has some muscular issues\n\n\ud83d\udd04 89' - last sub, Manu Serrano comes on for Rachad to help the team hold on to the lead\n\n90' - 8 minutes of added time \n\nFT - a good start into the second half gives Castilla the edge in an otherwise even game. Arbeloa's young team showed a very calm and collected performance, with no grave errors in defense after the scare in the 5th minute, and patient attacking. Castilla off to the best possible start of the season, 3 points at home against a good opponent\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 19:15 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee**: Abraham Dom\u00ednguez Cervantes\n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 1, Matchday 1\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[TVG2 (TV Galicia)](https://www.agalega.gal/videos/77550-tv-g2) (VPN to Spain needed) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-2-1-3): Fran Gonz\u00e1lez - Diego Aguado (68' V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as), Lamini Fati, Joan Mart\u00ednez, Jesus Fortea - Jorge Cestero, Cristian David (46' Pol Fortuny), Manuel \u00c1ngel - Roberto Mart\u00edn (81' Bruno Iglesias, Rachad Fettal (89' Manu Serrano), Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (68' Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga)\n\nBench: Guille S\u00fanico (GK), Javi Navarro (GK), David Jim\u00e9nez. \n\nUnavailable: Sergio Mestre (first team call-up), Mario Rivas (injury), C\u00e9sar Palacios (injury), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Thiago Pitarch (first team call-up). \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** \n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** - | 0pt | 0-0-0 | 0:0\n",

I would like to face them with an actual good and solid team. Arsenal is one of the only teams we haven\u2019t proven ourselves with. And you may even call me hurt, but I believe a big part of why we lost was luck. I mean, when did Declan rice do that before? It\u2019s like he did that specifically to beat Madrid. He is a great player, but that was pretty much a one time thing. It is just like a curse I feel we have to break. ",

A pathetic display in the Europa League last season, being utterly dominated by Pafos 3-0 in the CL qualifiers despite having much better players, and being also dominated by Maccabi Tel Aviv in the 1st leg of the EUL playoffs despite also having better players.",

Beliboy is pretty much a nonnegotiable starter(rightfully so) so what happens then?\n\nDoes one of the 3 midfielders get dropped and if so who?\n\nDo we revert back to the 3 in the back we used in CWC and start with Vinbappe up top?\n\nDoes Tchou get dropped to CB with Dean and Miltao/Rudiger or does Carvajal get the RCB position?\n\nWhere the f\\*ck does Camavinga fit in all of this?lol\n\nThoughts?",

He\u2019s clearly talented and can make a difference, but with so much competition for spots in both midfield and attack, it\u2019s hard to know if he\u2019ll actually play much. Do you guys think he\u2019ll get consistent minutes, or mostly be used as rotation? How do you see his season going overall?",
