He\u2019s so smooth and elegant with the ball. He glides across the pitch and is always 10 moves ahead. The timing of his runs and ball touches is incredible. No drama. Just pure football. Pure entertainment. Its what we can here to see!\n10/10 dribbling, 10/10 shooting, 10/10 pace, 10/10 Vision, 10/10 team work, 10/10 defending, 10/10 personality. 10/10 big game player. He is THE ULTIMATE BALLER. What a weapon to have. Always keeps his head down and does the work without complaining. Throw him in any position on that pitch and he is guaranteed to impress. Rodrygo deserves everything that he has achieved and more. Can\u2019t wait to see him grow and grow at RM. ",

        "content": "Any RM youngster who wants mins and feeling the pressure to improve G/A to impress Carletto, should look at the MILF or Rodrygo playbook.\n\nDebut properly (no need to make splashy headlines), dig in, don't complain, help make the job of the boss easier, play 5 mins to run down the clock when asked, team player, genuinely likeable at the club, be someone who looks like you are in for the long-term project of the club, let your own skills and capabilities shine over the games you play, and fans will come backing you.\n\nNo need to rush for 10 G/A as a 19 year old or aim for debut goal or a prodigy saviour or something like that. Any youngster genuinely needs to perform the best in his role among the seniors before he can expect regular mins.\n\nIf not as good yet, level up further until you are about as good as the senior in the first 11, or they are about to retire and hand the kingdom keys to you (e.g. Kroos to MILF).\n\nTrust the system. G/A alone will not grant you legitimacy in the first 11. Carletto will ask the seniors how good they think you are and whether they think you are ready. You need to impress them as a person and an athlete too.\n\nI cannot use asencio'a playbook as a reference because this means there needs to be a wipeout in a dept (such as our defence) in order to rise up. That may not happen so often in the midfield and forward dept.\n\nCan\u2019t use the Bellingo playbook. He is already akin to a 100m+ valued player coming into the club.\n\nVery few can succeed like Dani who gets loaned and be the best RB at the Bundesliga before coming back. But if you are that good, you can try that route.\n\nPls be patient with the process, and the process will be patient with you",
