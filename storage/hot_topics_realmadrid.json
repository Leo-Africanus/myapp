He will likely be leaving at the end of the season, and MAYBE Xabi comes in. Ancelotti has won 3 CLs in 6 seasons with Real Madrid. Two of those CLs with a squad sub par compared to Zidane\u2019s. He has had to deal with injuries, world class players leaving the squad, at times lacking financial backing for signings, a strong opponent in Manchester city (in the CL) and so many more things. Despite this, he\u2019s won everything for us in such a small amount of time. He\u2019s brought in world class players to build the Real Madrid of the future. He\u2019s faced every criticism with dignity and class. He\u2019s the most decorated European Coach in history. Yet our own fans with little to no football knowledge and management criticize him for small things like \u201cNot subbing in Arda earlier, blah blah blah\u201d. I will always back Ancelotti. I\u2019m glad to say I never folded on him like some of the fans here. Hala Madrid y Nada Mas. ",

        "title": "Ceballos has been quietly having a wonderful run of form",
        "content": "I must say, he's surprised me. His quality on the ball, his progressive passing, the way he maneuvers in the midfield. I've certainly had a lot to say about him in the past, but I'm very pleased with what I've been seeing from him as of late.It\u2019s not just the technical ability, he\u2019s showing a lot more confidence and composure when he's on the pitch. He\u2019s starting to pick the right moments to push forward and contribute to the attack while still being reliable defensively. That balance has made him a much more effective player, and it feels like he\u2019s finally carving out his place in the squad.Of course, there\u2019s always room for improvement. He still needs to work on maintaining this level consistently and avoiding some of the errors that have held him back in the past. But when he\u2019s in this kind of form, he brings a spark to the midfield that\u2019s hard to ignore. It\u2019s a side of him I\u2019ve wanted to see more of for so long. I hope he keeps this momentum going. The potential has always been there, and if he can continue to deliver performances like these, I think he\u2019ll play a key role for us as the season progresses. ",
