        "content": "Translation using ChatGPT\n\n\u00c1lvaro Carreras remains a top target for Real Madrid, but Benfica does not want to lose the player, and the price they demand to release the left-back is not pleasing to the Madrid club.\n\nBenfica wants to receive the full \u20ac50 million release clause, a value the Spanish side is unwilling to pay\u2014especially not in a single installment. However, they are open to making an offer of \u20ac30\u201335 million plus bonuses, which could bring the deal closer to the figures Benfica is seeking.\n\nAccording to our findings, the clubs have yet to take concrete or significant steps to bridge the gap, but Real Madrid is aware of the conditions that must be met to make the transfer viable.\n\nAccording to reports published in Spain this Saturday, particularly by AS, Real Madrid\u2014who recently introduced Xabi Alonso as their new coach, replacing Carlo Ancelotti (the Italian will lead the Brazil national team)\u2014is also focused on other signings. The resistance encountered from Benfica is believed to have \"cooled\" their pursuit of Carreras. If this retreat in interest is confirmed, it goes against earlier suggestions that Real Madrid would do everything to sign Carreras before the FIFA Club World Cup and have him play in white during the tournament, which will take place in the United States between June 14 and July 13. This is an important factor in the decision-making process, as Benfica also intends to rely on the left-back for the Club World Cup.\n\nOne possible scenario on the table is that Real Madrid could forgo signing the defender immediately and wait until Benfica finishes their participation in the U.S. Club World Cup. In that case, Benfica might also be more flexible in negotiations.\n\nAs reported by A BOLA, Carreras is happy at Benfica and has a contract until 2029, but returning to play for Real Madrid\u2014the club where he developed\u2014is a dream. In that sense, and as the Italian journalist Fabrizio Romano, a transfer market specialist, reported last week, the player and Real have already reached an agreement. Carreras is reportedly set to earn around \u20ac9 million per season\u2014figures that Benfica cannot match.\n\n\u00c1lvaro Carreras was signed by Benfica in January of the 2023/24 season, initially on loan from Manchester United. He signed permanently at the start of last season for \u20ac6 million (United retained a \u20ac20 million buyback clause, which they are unlikely to exercise). After some initial difficulties, he rapidly established himself, especially after Bruno Lage took over the team. He played 50 matches\u201448 as a starter\u2014scored 4 goals, and provided 5 assists. His strong performances, particularly in the UEFA Champions League, attracted interest from several clubs, with Real Madrid leading the pack. He is only 22 years old and is knocking on the door of Spain\u2019s senior national team.\n\nAccording to the Spanish media, Real Madrid sees Grimaldo\u2014formerly of Benfica and now at Leverkusen\u2014as an alternative to Carreras. However, Grimaldo is 29 years old and would not be a cheap signing either.\n\nCarreras is indeed the top priority for the new coach, Xabi Alonso. Neither Real Madrid nor Benfica has yet made any official statements on the matter. Benfica\u2019s squad is set to return to training next week, and the U.S. Club World Cup kicks off in two weeks.",

He has always wanted to play for Real.\n\nYes we had a terrible season. Yes our forwards don\u2019t press that much but things will always change \n\nYes we don\u2019t play beautiful football like psg or Barca or whatever but we never did anyways and we won 6 ucls in 11 years so idk what the fuss is about \n\nThings will click in over time . He did win the golden boot and the pichichi. So that\u2019s one for starting. \n\nWe have a new manager , a new right back and a new center back. We are having our new era. Things won\u2019t click on instantly maybe so give it some time\n\nIt\u2019s Real Madrid and we will be back so relax.",

        "title": "Updated Lineup For The Club World Cup (+Carreras doesn\u2019t arrive)",
        "content": "Real Madrid\u2019s defensive situation is in flux ahead of the Club World Cup and the second half of the season. Injuries to David Alaba, \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o and Ferland Mendy have thinned out our options, while Fran Garc\u00eda\u2019s inconsistencies and Mendy\u2019s questions about his form and fitness have prompted Xabi Alonso to demand reinforcements at left-back. Ongoing talks have looked at top targets like William Saliba and Ibrahima Konat\u00e9, but their price tags and the tight window before the Club World Cup make those moves unlikely in time. Our alternative pursuit of Alphonso Davies fell through after Bayern Munich\u2019s \u20ac22 million valuation and his recent injury. Meanwhile, Myles Lewis-Skelly (18) impressed against us in the Champions League; The Guardian reports that Madrid are monitoring him closely, likely for a 2026 free transfer rather than this summer. The most concrete negotiations involve \u00c1lvaro Carreras, where Real have secured Carreras\u2019s agreement but still need to negotiate Benfica\u2019s \u20ac40\u201350 million price (with \u20ac18 million owed to Manchester United). Talks between the three clubs have been intense; Madrid already has Carreras\u2019s \u201cyes,\u201d but the deal must close before next Tuesday\u2019s (by July 1, 2025) pre-Club World Cup window shuts. Interest has also been noted in Guti\u00e9rrez, Kerkez and Hatto, but none are slam-dunk, immediate solutions.\n\n* **If Carreras does arrive: 3-4-1-2**\n\nGK: Courtois, sub: Lunin\n\nRCB: Asencio, Carvajal ---- CB: Rudiger, Jacobo ---- LCB: Huijsen, Alaba\n\nRDM: Trent, Vazquez ---- LDM: Carreras, Fran  \nRCM: Valverde - Modric ---- (\\~CDM: Tchou) ---- LCM: Bellingham, Camavinga  \nAM: Arda/Bellingham, Brahim\n\nRCF: Mbapp\u00e9, Rodrygo ---- LCF: Vini, Endrick\n\n* **If Carreras doesn't arrive:** **3-5-2**\n\n**GK:** Thibaut Courtois\n\n**CBs:** Asencio \u2013 R\u00fcdiger \u2013 Huijsen\n\n**(L/R)CM\\*:**  Valverde &lt;-&gt; Trent Alexander-Arnold (acting as inverted backs when needed)\n\n**CM's\\*\\*/\\*\\*\\*:** Arda - Tchou -  Bellingham\n\n**Forwards :** Bappi - Vini\n\n\\*:TAA, Normally a right-sided player, he could invert into left-defensive midfield to negate threats down his channel and initiate attacks through midfield passing. His long-range passing and vision help counterbalance the loss of a natural left-back. Hes done this at England. Valverde playing in an inverted right-back role, Valverde\u2019s engine allows him to track back and cover the right flank defensively when we press high. His ability to drive forward also adds a midfield overload. These can switch.  \nBoth can tuck inside to form a back five when needed, minimizing exposure down the width and allowing G\u00fcler and Bellingham to roam between the lines.\n\n\\*\\*Tchouameni, The anchor in front of the back three, he can break up counter-attacks and recycle possession to the more creative midfielders. His presence is vital, as he\u2019s our only natural defensive midfielder fully fit. He connects defence and offense. And as we know Xabi does NOT want Tchou's quality lost playing as a CB.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Deployed centrally, Arda\u2019s dribbling and directness help unlock defenses when we\u2019re pinned back. Doing so, Arda opens space for bappi to make the runs.  Bellingham\u2019s dynamic movement creates space for Vin\u00edcius Jr. and the wing-backs. He can link play between the midfield and front line, arriving late into the box to finish or pull defenders out of position.\n\nBappi and Vini should speak for itself, pace and skills combined. Personal goals need to be set aside for these two to become an iconic duo and win many trophies togheter. Xabi will have to prioritise the relationship, Jude should help as a leader and generally positive spirit.\n\nIn central defence, don\u2019t forget youth options Jacobo Ram\u00f3n and Joan Mart\u00ednez, but they\u2019re insurance more than first-team priority.",
