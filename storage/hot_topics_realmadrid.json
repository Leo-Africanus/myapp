        "content": "The game last night wasn\u2019t really a surprise. We\u2019ve seen the same scenario play out, with competitive teams this season. The reason for it is we don\u2019t have a midfield maestro, except the 2 games where Ceballos played good, then he got injured. You can see it in the transitions from the midfield to the offense. That\u2019s what makes the offense what it is. We\u2019ve seen our wingers drop because of it. This season they have been forced to be creative, and you can only do so much. We need Bellingham to move out of CAM, and assume this role. He\u2019s the only visionary in our midfield unfortunately, except Modric for 15 minutes of the games, due to his age. Valverde is a box to box, so I\u2019m not sure why we are reliant on him to do that type of work. Offenses need key midfielders that make key passes, if we don\u2019t have that we don\u2019t have a team. That role isn\u2019t just to find solutions in the offensive end. It also creates value in terms of moving pressure from the opposition on our defense. Brahim can play a hybrid CM because he can create spaces and dribble. (we did it with DiMaria in 2014), but we need the coaching staff to see this. Our offense outside of Mbappe looks like Man utd\u2019s and it\u2019s scary. ",

        "content": "Let me start by saying that Ancelotti is responsible of what is going on, as a coach. He is NOT innocent and deserves all criticism, as things barely improved since the beginning of the season.\n\nIt's fine if you're a supporter and you want change because you see things are not working for your team. Nothing wrong with being mad at your team losing like this in the favorite competition.\n\nWith that being said, the brain dead takes of 'Bring in Raul/Zidane/X for the second leg and the rest of the season' is just un-fucking-believable. This is not Lopetegui or Rafael Benitez. This is Carlo Ancelotti, the coach with the most titles and who won us 3 UCLs ! Doesn't he deserve to finish the season ? If he doesn't, who does ? And you all counter Bar\u00e7a posts about Real Madrid disrespecting their legends !!!\n\nAnd none of these motherfuckers watched a game managed by Raul in Castilla. It was the same cries last year and the year before and the year before, since Carlo took charge. Don't tell me this is because of his performance this season.. even when he performed, I still see the shit he takes, and people wanted Tuchel to replace him back in the day !\n\nWe have lots of problems, including players mentality and squad depth and injury crisis. But y'all love summing everything into 'Carlo is garbage fuck off bring in Xabi/Klopp/Zizou'...  because you want results right away and can't take a loss and want a scapegoat and an easy roast. You think managing an institute and a club like Real Madrid by switching legend coaches with 10 matches or 15 matches left in the season is the way to go...\n\nI will not change reality with this, as I believe those stupid cunts exist in every 'popular' club. I remember Bar\u00e7a fans posting a 'Hansi Flick is not right for us' upvoted post when Benefica was winning against them in that 5-4 remontada. This is where a club like freaking Atletico Madrid is even more respectful towards Simeone... and even Man City out there, who is supposed to have 'glory hunters' is defending Guardiola despite the shit performance.\n\nI ain't asking to defend Ancelotti. Ancelotti is NOT a failure of a coach, but now he is failing. We won, made crazy come backs, celebrated UCL wins like nothing under this coach... the least I can do is NOT disrespect him and let him have what it looks like it's his final season and even if my brain doesn't believe in a come back, my heart does. He has given a lot.\n\nI'm no Ancelotti nut eater, I'm a man who has been watching Real Madrid since 2011 and lived his most joyful moments under Ancelotti and during our worst moments, I understand the old man is human and prone to mistakes and not just some idiot sitting in his room playing FIFA and thinking of players as PS5 bots and acting like they understand 'tactics', like a lot of people.\n\nNothing wrong with 'We need a new coach' and 'Ancelotti did a lot but his time is up'... but seriously any 'Ancelotti has been a lucky bastard carried by individual brilliance' or 'Ancelotti is stupid, bring in Raul or Zizou' for the second leg, GTFO",

        "title": "Arsenal had a clear PLAN throughout the game, what was ours?",
        "content": "Arsenal were missing their best CB, their main RB, LB and BOTH of their striker options. Both of their wingers had just returned from injuries as well. They played with a back four with like... 22 yo average age and still barely had any issues against a 500m front three.\n\nDespite all those setbacks, they had a clear plan. They had two ways trying to score:\n\n1. Isolate wingers in 1v1 situations against our fullbacks/CMs. Saka and Martinelli tried to do it all game and perform cutbacks inside our box, many of them were really dangerous. That's how they won both fouls that lead to goals, that's pretty much how they created the 3-0 (Rice driving the ball, pass to Trossard, 1v1, pass to Skelly, cutback, goal).\n2. Taking advantage of set pieces. Yes, no team can rely on scoring a freekick every game (let alone two), but they have clearly put hours into this aspect of the game. Almost all their set pieces were dangerous, Saka even tried to score an Olimpico.\n\nOn the other hand, what was our own plan? We started a 40 year old controlling midfielder (nothing wrong with that), but our \"plan\" was to sit back and never have the ball. All that without pressing. We started a 33 year old at LB, who has done nothing to deserve to start there in the past 2 seasons (Arsenal's LB was 18 and was amazing) and forced our AM to play... LCB to cover for him. And still failed. Our front three have zero cohesion with each other, or with the rest of the team for that matter. Our midfield is just there for the vibes, no one tried to carry the ball forward. For yet another game this season, we constantly tried to launch long balls from the defense, with like 1% success rate. Our \"transitions\" feel like a relegation zone team that have no talent to keep the ball, so they just send the ball to their striker, in hopes of something randomly happening (like the time Kiwior slipped yesterday and we almost had a good chance).\n\nAlso I saw a stat that **Arsenal run 12km more than us** yesterday, that's literally like playing with an extra player. So, we have a team that can't run, can't press, can't pass, can't create, can't defend, can't defend set pieces, aren't good at taking advantage at set pieces. What is this billion Euro valued squad even good at? What are they doing on training sessions? \n\nAny other day I would be extremely mad for losing 3-0 by 2 freekick goals, that only happens if you had prime CR7 or Juninho as your opponent. But Arsenal fully deserved this victory. I try to be optimistic for next week, but it's not that easy.",

        "content": "I think the distances covered in this game might be one of the best stats to show our season in a nutshell.\n\nTop 4 performers from Arsenal and 1km less on average. Our players are spent.\n\nIt has been discussed plenty of times how unlucky we are with injuries. 2 regular starters missing from the defence (Dani and Eder) and most midfielders struggled with at least one significant injury (min. 1 month) throughout the season.\n\nIt has also been mentioned how our squad has caveats. No backup RB. 2 CBs at the start of the season (Rudi is 1 and Eder and Alaba I count as half each since they had major injuries). We got lucky with Asencio, his integration was not a result of precise planning but rather necessity. No proper alternate FW.\n\nThen the misallocation of minutes. Obviously we don\u2019t see how the players work in trainings so let\u2019s trust Carlo\u2019s and his team\u2019s judgment on the players performance and deserved minutes. But I cannot fathom that for them the only two options for the fringe players are less than 5 mins or 90 mins every 1,5 months. There were several games where some of them could have started. There were other games where they could have been substituted earlier.\n\nAnd now Jude and Fede are running on their last reserves. Rudiger is a colossus but I think even he might start to feel fatigued and some cracks start to show up in his performance. Asencio is great but not experienced enough. Tchoumani is our best player right now. Luka is unfortunately not fit anymore to deliver every 3 days. Camavinga for one 8+ performance has 2 underwhelming ones. Vini-problem no need to be elaborated anymore.\n\nI\u2019m being too pessimistic and just had to vent a little?",
