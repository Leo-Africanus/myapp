        "content": "I've been a madrid fan since like 15 years and started looking things up on reddit only like 3-4 years ago. But damn one thing I noticed is whenever something is not going well people on here hype players up and then doom them if they make 1 mistake AND! vice versa!\n\nJacobo: \"He is so shit omg how can he play for madrid\". He scores 1 goal after doing mistake after mistake and everyone \"omg Im so sorry, you are the best, this kid has talent\" - I'm not hating on jacobo just pointing out what happened so far\n\nBrahim: \"Wow he really has creativity, he can actually help us\". After he does a mistake \"bench this guy, never really understood how people could think he is good\"\n\nArda: Plays okayish, gets only a few minutes but is on the wrong position, \"omg he is so useless, stop hyping him up\". then he plays at his real position and does a great job, \"omg he is the best ever how could anyone ever doubt him\". then he plays 1 mid game after that and everyone is again like \"overrated player, he only does well if the team does well\". he crosses the ball from the corner and tchouameni scores \"he is a magician at the corners\" - there is no player that is good at headers (injured or suspended) and no one scores \"damn he cant even play a decent cross\"\n\nVini: Sees the tactic Ancelotti is trying to establish doesnt help shit and takes responsibility and dribbles through 4 players just to miss the goal by an inch \"horrible player, so selfish and useless, hopefully he goes to saudi arabia\" then he does the same thing again but scores \"wow truly ballon dor player and a madridista by heart, he is so passionate\"\n\nBellingham: Plays great for months and carries the team \"he is the best, its so much fun to watch him play, he gives 120% for the team\" - he is off form for 3 games \"bellingham lost interest in football, he spends too much time at the barber, he should train more\"\n\nLong story short, some fans here are so incredibly toxic it just annoys me. It doesnt take a pro to see that ancelottis tactics dont work for madrid this season, sure perez and the injured players had a big impact on that but some stuff is just 100% on ancelotti. \n\nstop blaming the players for every mistake they do in a team that has no tactics, no ideas. you want vini to attack and be creative but also to not lose the ball, how is that possible? you want arda to play magic crosses when there is no one to head the ball in. you want bellingham to give 120% every game and when he is too exhausted to do a full sprint back you blame him for being lazy. you let it out on the players whenever you can. you can see the system is simply not working. \n\nstop overhyping players for 1 good game and also stop dooming players for 1 bad game. enough of these players have already shown they have the qualities for real madrid and simply need a better coach",

It's just that we need aerial threats going forward someone who can play the role joselu did for us last season and endrick is not it. I hope we loan him out to portugal to develop more and also I hope gonzalo develops his ability as a CF/ST.\n\n2) JUDE needs to get that surgery done now. He is one of our best players someone xabi would be looking upto to build the team around. Ik CWC brings alot of money on the table but next season is going to be very pivotal for his career (with WC right there and a new coach at club)\n\n3) With jude gone for surgery we can give his responsibility for CWC to arda and watch how he handles it give him more minutes. I'd love to see what he can do.\n\n4) Luka Modric just played another 90 minutes for us . HE HAS TO BE ONE OF THE BEST SIGNINGS WE EVER MADR. I love him\n\nThat's it for my rant. Hala madrid y nada mas . Here's to hoping next season is better",

        "content": "I\u2019ve held off on this opinion all season, but after today\u2019s game against Sevilla, I finally feel it: we need a midfield reinforcement.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 our midfield is stacked with talent. But something feels incomplete without Kroos. We\u2019re missing that player who can absorb the tempo of the game, control the rhythm, and dictate when to speed up or slow things down. Kroos wasn\u2019t fast or physically dominant \u2014 he was intelligent, composed, and his presence stitched together the defense and attack. Especially his pinpoint long passes and through balls\u2026 We felt it bad this game and I think we will next season. Our defense and attack needs to be stitched together and our current midfield does't seem to be equipped for that particular task.\n\nWe don\u2019t need a flashy or expensive signing. We just need someone who can bring calm to the chaos. Someone who can take the pressure off when needed, and help maintain control in tough moments.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t know who that player is. But after today, I\u2019m convinced we need one. Would love to hear your thoughts \u2014 who could realistically fill that Kroos-shaped void? Someone with a similar profile who could grow into it, may be?",
