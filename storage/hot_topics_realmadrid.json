Valverde had to go back to RB, Camavinga. The Early mistake also ruined the game and our morale.\n\nSo I don't think it should be used to judge our squad, our players' quality, and it's not wise to buy 2-3+ players simply because of this game.\n\n\nBut yeah we need to learn from it. The whole team need to know how to press and form a balanced midfield. The 3 forward combination was terrible. \n\nI don't think Vini and Mbappe's main problem is their attitude, but they need to know how to press, how to do their job under Alonso. Especially Vini actually has very high workload but he needs to be given more instruction.",

Besides the lack of pressing and collective effort, it seems we simply miss that brain in midfield. Who\u2019s a realistic signing you\u2019d want to see? I\u2019ve seen links to Angelo Stiller from Stuttgart. Do you think he fits what we need, or should we be looking elsewhere?

But in 2016\u20132017, he shifted more into a striker role, delivering clutch goals in the Champions League and showing insane efficiency.

Of all defensive mistakes you look in the squad, and honestly majority of it is from positioning.

Since today marks Vinicius' 25th birthday, I've decided to go ahead and collect all the data about his goal contributions throughout his career for **club and country.**\n\nI don't think it's a surprise seeing Barcelona topping the list since he has played so many games against them.\n\nWhat's interesting in my opinion is the fact that Liverpool and Manchester City appear on this list. This shows his great performances in big games in the UCL.\n\nNOTE: All the data has been collected by myself, I used sources such as fotmob, besoccer and flashscore. it may differ a slightly bit from what Transfermarkt shows. For example, Transfermarkt gives the player an assist if he gets fouled inside the box and his teammate scores the penalty (check Brazil-Colombia 2-1), which normally shouldn't be the case for an assist.\n\nI am  open for suggestions and recommendations on what to improve visually.",

Players are still building fitness and chemistry, and Xabi Alonso is still figuring out the system.\n\nCriticism is okay, that\u2019s a part of football. But what I\u2019m seeing isn\u2019t just criticism, it\u2019s pure hate. We wanted Mbapp\u00e9 for years, he did okay this season, and now some fans are turning on him, let's not be too quick and let Xabi have his time with him. He's arguably the best in the world currently and Xabi will get him to play that way. \n\nLet's just step back and let Xabi do his thing. ",

Shockingly, **26.6% of posts about Mbapp\u00e9** were negative, followed closely by **25.3% for Vin\u00edcius** \u2014 making them the **top two most targeted footballers for online abuse globally**, based on a 150,000-post sample.\"\n\nIt\u2019s staggering to see our players subjected to so much hate. This isn\u2019t just criticism \u2014 it's sustained, toxic bombardment. Social media platforms and football authorities need to step up. These mainstream stars deserve protection, not persecution. Enough is enough.\n\n",
