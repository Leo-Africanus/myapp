Over the years we\u2019ve hosted watch parties, sent members to matches, partner with brands - the sort of things a Pe\u00f1a is supposed to do. We\u2019ve gone through the requirements on the official site and we\u2019re confident we meet all of them.\n\nThe issue is with actually getting a reply from the club. Every time we email the Department of Pe\u00f1as, we get one rather hasty reply asking for some info...and that's about it. No follow-up, no progress, fully ghosted. We\u2019ve tried different contact addresses, provided all the details and evidence they could possibly need \u2014 same story every time. It\u2019s been like this for almost three years now.\n\nSo, to those of you who\u2019ve successfully gotten your Pe\u00f1a officially recognized \u2014 is there another way around this, or someone specific we should reach out to? Any insight at all would be super appreciated.\n",

He had left that position far behind before even coming to Madrid. Even at the 2020 Euros, when France had literally Benzema as a striker, they were still playing 3-4-1-2, with both Benzema and Mbappe as CF\n\nIt can also be seen that he has had better stats as CF too.\n\nCompare that to Vini, who won the best player in the world award(FIFA the Best) and came second in Ballon d'Or, being one of the main reason Real Madrid had their most succesful season since the 1960's, as a LEFT WINGER.\n\n  \nVini was straight up the best winger in football, for at least 3 years.
