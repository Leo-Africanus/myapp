        "title": "The Vini Mbappe rift is only worsened by our \u201cfans\u201d constantly picking sides and insisting on them not being compatible",
        "content": "If you search Vini and Mbappe highlights on YouTube the majority of the results are videos showcasing how each player is \u201cselfish\u201d and \u201cneeds to go\u201d. It has been one season and while I\u2019m not saying we shouldn\u2019t be critical of the bad there is a tremendous overreaction on this sub and across Madrid fans that it is hopeless and each player is selfish and immature. By polluting the conversation of these two players with only negatives and narrative of inherent incompatibility we as a fanbase are only serving to create more of a rift. \n\nThese are arguably the two best players in the world. Vini\u2019s \u201cbad season\u201d is one where he contributed more g/a in the UCL than games played. And still recorded 21 g/a in La liga. He\u2019s also only a year removed from a balon d or season and has contributed more g/a in the UCL than any other player across the last 5 seasons. Mbappe bagged 31 goals and while he also struggled last year when it came to link up play his contribution shouldn\u2019t be understated.\n\nRather than spread a narrative of incompatibility,  lack of motivation and selfishness (God forbid a player is trying to negotiate the best contract for himself) let\u2019s have faith that it may take two of the best in the world more than a single game under Xabi to find their best form.",

Someone that you feel a sinking feeling whenever they get open space, and whenever you saw them in the starting lineup felt scared. Aside from Messi, who I would assume to be an obvious answer.",

        "content": "Hello Madridistas,\n\nIt is time for the annual 90-50-20. With the arrival of Xabi Alonso, the transfers of Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dean Huijsen, \u00c1lvaro Carreras and Franco Mastantuono, and the departures of club-legend Luka Modric, Caf\u00facas V\u00e1zquez and Jes\u00fas Vallejo, the club looks in for a revamp. \n\nThe game is simple: You write 3 statements: One you are 90% sure will happen, one you are 50% sure, and one you are 20% sure.\n\nMy thoughts:\n\n\\- 90%: Mbapp\u00e9 pichichi, and breaks the record from this year in both goals and assists\n\n\\- 50%: Tchouam\u00e9ni establishes himself as the most important system player for Alonso\n\n\\- 20%: Mastantuono scores a crazy free kick in a crucial match.\n\nLink for last years predictions: [https://www.reddit.com/r/realmadrid/comments/1erbuqs/905020\\_for\\_the\\_2425\\_edition/](https://www.reddit.com/r/realmadrid/comments/1erbuqs/905020_for_the_2425_edition/)\n\nCome back with your receipts if you nailed one!\n\n",

But that's brings a lot of problems for us Bellingham was the only \"attacking\" starter we have that who actively tues to press the opposition. We are literally defending 9v11 right now, it'll only go worse and also with sources saying Perez isn't interested in buying more midfielders. How do you guys think Xabi will tackle this?",

Note - Madrid management thinks there is not one good enough in the market. It means they don't rate stiller that high.",
