I can only assume this would be if a player joined after a season where we won at least one trophy, stayed for a number of trophy less seasons, and left before we won a trophy again.\n\nCan anybody help list such players in our history? Or at least in the 21st century.\n\nBy the way in this case I\u2019m considering first team players who were part of the squad for any given tournament, regardless of if they played much or at all.\n\nThanks!",
