        "content": "There has been a lot of push recently saying he should stay a fullback, and shouldn't complain about it. But as we can see from the match, RB does not utilize his skillset the best. He is forced to be too defensive and not contribute enough offensively. Remember that Trent pass to Valverde over the defenders where Valverde gave a 1v1 pass to Gonzalo with the goalkeeper? Could never have been possible if he was RB.\n\nIn our best season ever, 23/24, he was an RM. He is excellent at tackles, and at crossing the ball into the box. But most of his work as RB is tracking players, preventing runs into the box, stopping headers. All of which he's nothing special at.\n\n  \nAt RM, he can run box to box, as he loves to. Without the same amount of defensive duty, but still helping his fullback partner with the occasional amazing tackle (which he did with Trent yesterday). Let the RB stay back when it's time for defense, help them with tackling and winning the ball, then offensively, run with the ball down the wing, either pass to the winger or let the fullback make the overlap in which case he can stay behind to stop any counter attacks.\n\nHe can make runs into the box, and when the team is in the box with the RB involved in the attack, he can camp at the edge of the box so he can put his generational shooting talent to use (a talent which gets utterly wasted whenever he plays RB. His shooting and scoring rate goes down immensely).",

Meanwhile there has been multiple occasions where Madrid played just like this. 2-1 vs Barca, 3-0 vs Bilbao, 6-1 vs Monaco. \n\nThe reasons why Madrid \u201clook better\u201d are as follows:\n\n1. Sociedad isn\u2019t a low block team. Madrid historically always play better against teams that don\u2019t sit in a low block even if that means they lose sometimes (against city this season for example)\n\n2. Second and most importantly Trent Alexander Arnold. His passing ability is something Madrid desperately needs. His cross field passes, through balls through defensive lines opens up so much more for Madrid. \n\n3. Mbappe and vini payed for dinner. This one is obviously a joke but an act like that from two of the main stars can go a long way. So from now on they must pay for dinner before every game. They will also have to pay for breakfast on UCL nights. ",
