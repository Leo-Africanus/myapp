A French team is still yet to win here too. Mbapp\u00e9 also hit 50 goals for us as well.\n\nThe first half was enjoyable, fluid, and electric; the second half turned into a grind, exposing defensive transitions that need sharpening and a finishing touch that could have made it more comfortable. Worried a little about Fede and Vini. Hopefully they can bounce back before things get tough later in the season.\n\nWe\u2019ve broken down every performance, player by player.\n\nWhere do you think the team needs to improve the most?\n\n\\- MadridNoir \ud83e\udd0d\ud83d\udc51",

        "content": "Before the bandwagoners cry panic and Player FC fans chop the throat of their favourite\u2019s competitor, I must tell you that these are the games the Champion teams win even if it comes at the cost of good fortune, mentality or pure tactical masterstroke. Today, we could have easily collapsed after Dani\u2019s red card, yet the players knew they had enough quality to pull off a win.\n\nOur youngsters started brilliantly but a very poor lapse of concentration from Guler cost us the first goal and Mastantuano\u2019s open goal miss came as a shocker. However, I was delighted to see Xabi backing them and giving them the chance to redeem themselves after half-time. The correct message went to the players that they need to step up rather than \u201cone mistake and you perish.\u201d I thought Franco was electric in the first half and Arda had a promising second half. However, I also saw Arda\u2019s stamina giving up on him after first 20-25 mins, maybe Xabi could look to manage that better.\n\nSpecial shout out to Rodrygo who felt sublime with his intent and technical progress giving us the equaliser. And Vini brought his UCL charm once again. Very good from Tchou once again and Valverde\u2019s running was the difference between the possession stats of the two sides. People questioning Fede\u2019s presence have never really realised that modern football needs players who can match, crash and one- up anyone\u2019s tempo. Mbappe is a man possessed and goals would come for him no matter the up and downs he experiences this season.\n\nYoungsters would not be perfect anytime soon but it\u2019s a risk Xabi knows could yield us something very special. There were many visible shortcomings and disappointments but in the end we march forward with one hundred percent record. I am sure everyone will bounce back and have their moments.",

In Vin\u00edcius\u2019 case, it seems to be partly a mental struggle that affects his decision-making, combined with a noticeable drop in explosiveness\u2014he simply doesn\u2019t look as sharp as he did 18 months ago. Valverde\u2019s case, however, feels more tactical: we still don\u2019t seem to be using him in a way that maximizes his qualities. In any case, Xabi needs to find both the tactical solutions and the right words to bring them back to where they belong\u2014at the very top level.",

        "content": "I remember either Xabi or Fede saying that Xabi wanted them to play higher up the pitch and only really provide support if it was needed. I see Arda doing that, but with Fede, he legit seems stuck in the double pivot with Tchouameni or even being the one staying deeper. Is xabi trying to give Fede less of a workload, or something? It just feels like a weird way to use Fede, especially when we know he's a good goal scorer ",

What are your thoughts on Carreras so far ?",

        "content": "  After the match today against Marseille it is obvious, there is still something lacking, a more clinical finishing. The team was over the place and we depended on luck, if we are honest, to barely win. It seems that our whole game plan relies on Mbappe. Mastantuono showed to be promising but still lacks development, same as Guler who is amazing, but had a bad game. Our attack is not necessarily bad, but besides Mbappe the team missed way too many chances today. What do you expect to happen from here on? Since for now it seems like Liverpool will give us a big defeat. ",
