The teams performance was sub-par as a whole. He carried the team for past few seasons. Carried us at the start of this season as well while Mbappe was adjusting. (since Benzema Ballon d'Or season he's been our most creative player). Now all this hate?\nI get criticism for his attitude, because it's horrible and he has it coming, but he's our player, and he puts up numbers, we need to support our players. We can call him out on his antics all day and I'm all for that.\nWe can't be calling for people's heads after some bad games. When you look at the bigger picture, he's a crucial part of our team and won't leave.",

I think Camavinga, Tchouameni, Jude, Guler, Valverde, and Cabaillos are elite talent that will grow and develop at Real Madrid. I don't want any high profile players to join at the moment. I see what Xabi is doing and I'm very excited to see the team improve and better execute the ideas. I hope we don't sign anyone in midfield. I want to see Guler and Camavinga play more, learn, and improve. Becoming a great team with these names is 50x more satisfying than buying Wirtz or some most wanted midfielders at the moment. We should only buy first team players for positions we don't have (RB, CB, LB, ST)\n\n  \nLooking forward to watch more games under Xabi and see how the game changes. Last game I saw Courtois playing higher and providing passing options. We saw Huisjen as well driving the ball forward to exploit spaces left by 1:1 marking. The second half change of Guler gave us massive advantage and we completely dominated the second half, while also struggling to score.\n\n  \nWe also tried to play high press but didn't really do it well and Al-Hilal was able to get out easily every time. But I'm sure it will improve.",

        "content": "While a win would have been perfect, the draw is an acceptable result too, considering the state of our team.\n\nIf we had played our first game against semi-pros like Bayern did, it definitely would have made our team over-confident and they likely would have taken the group stages less seriously\n\nHad it been against PSG, we would have definitely lost badly and that would have destroyed the morale.\n\nAl-Hilal, despite being a Saudi Team, is one of the best teams in the Saudi league. They have some good players who can even play in Europe. Our struggle against them will definitely motivate the lads to do better. Although it was a draw, it was not one of those games where we were lacking overall energy and dangerous chances.\n\nWhile some of our starters definitely are under-performing ATM, the team is definitely more organized and I believe we will do much better in the next game. Xabi, for sure, doesn't have any favorites right now and we will surely see flexible lineups and tactics that adapt to our opponents and situations.\n\nPS: We haven't even used our Turtle yet.",

        "title": "Xabi Alonso won\u2019t fix Real Madrid overnight \u2014 unless the squad fits his vision",
        "content": "I\u2019ve closely followed Xabi Alonso\u2019s entire journey at Bayer Leverkusen \u2014 every detail \u2014 and that\u2019s why I\u2019m convinced he\u2019s the right coach. He\u2019s a dreamer of the game. What sets him apart is his willingness to learn from experiences in order to correct his mistakes. Xabi is not a rigid, formulaic coach \u2014 and rigidity never works in the long run. Instead, he\u2019s someone who seeks balance, and that\u2019s one of the most crucial elements in football.\n\nFootball is not just about names \u2014 not even the biggest or the best ones. It\u2019s a reflection of the social and environmental makeup of each player, each country, each league, and so on. That\u2019s why, for example, players who rely primarily on physicality are rare in La Liga \u2014 it\u2019s simply not in the league\u2019s player DNA.\n\nNo coach can succeed by using a tactical setup that doesn\u2019t suit the players\u2019 profiles. It\u2019s like asking a plumber to do electrical work \u2014 it\u2019s just not their job. That\u2019s why people expecting Xabi Alonso to instantly bring positional play, tiki-taka, or complex patterns to Madrid are being unrealistic. That kind of transformation doesn\u2019t happen overnight \u2014 and it certainly doesn\u2019t happen if the squad\u2019s characteristics don\u2019t fit.\n\nThere\u2019s also this idea that, just because Madrid has \u201cbetter\u201d players than Leverkusen, Xabi will automatically produce better results. That\u2019s a flawed mindset. Coaches can only work with what fits. Xabi\u2019s responsibility is to build a system with the right players \u2014 not just the best names. Blaming him for not succeeding with an incompatible squad is unfair.\n\nTake this example: If you tell someone that a player from Getafe is a better fit for Madrid than someone from Liverpool, they\u2019ll accuse you of being a \u201cfake intellectual.\u201d These people think football is just about big names and player rankings. But at Leverkusen, Xabi built a team around players who fit, and that\u2019s why the product on the pitch was so good.\n\nAt his press conference, Xabi said the team needs to control possession and slow the tempo \u2014 which has been a major issue for Madrid since Kroos. The team became overly vertical, and as a result, started losing possession far more frequently. Why? Because there\u2019s no true midfield organizer who can manage tempo and dictate play.\n\nThat\u2019s why a midfield made up of Valverde, Bellingham, Tchouam\u00e9ni, and Camavinga has failed repeatedly \u2014 they\u2019re all direct players. This leads to higher turnover, especially when there\u2019s no one playing between the lines effectively. That\u2019s also why the team looks better with Ceballos or Modri\u0107 on the pitch.\n\nEven the claim that Liverpool under Klopp had a similar midfield is a poor comparison. No one talks about the technical quality and on-ball organization of their backline. And even Klopp eventually brought in players like Thiago and Gravenberch to fix that. Likewise, Madrid won\u2019t improve until it has players with the right profiles.\n\nWith Milit\u00e3o, Arda G\u00fcler, Hausern, and someone like Carreras in the side, Madrid will naturally improve in possession. Then you can start building a proper midfield. That\u2019s where someone like Zubimendi \u2014 or any true midfield organizer \u2014 becomes essential. Only then will Madrid start solving its biggest problems.\n\nYes, the attack has issues too, but those will ease over time. The main thing is that Xabi Alonso learns. He observes, he studies his opponents, and that\u2019s why he\u2019ll eventually build a coherent system. There will be progress. There will be improvements. But the team won\u2019t reach the level people dream of unless the squad profile fits the system.\n\nPeople get excited watching training clips, but reality hits hard \u2014 just like it did in the match vs Al-Hilal. And then you had fans defending Ancelotti who were attacked for saying this very thing. The squad wasn\u2019t balanced. It wasn\u2019t built properly.\n\nFor instance, why did Hausern look so good vs Al-Hilal?\nBecause he has the quality and the right profile for what was asked of him.\n\nNow imagine signing a random defender with poor positional awareness, who can\u2019t contribute to buildup, can\u2019t show for passes, doesn\u2019t move intelligently, lacks spatial awareness \u2014 and then expecting the coach to teach him fundamentals he never learned growing up? And if that doesn\u2019t work, we blame the coach?\nThat\u2019s just unfair.",

        "content": "yes another post about Vinicius Jr.\nIn the first few minutes I was happy seeing Vini showing the intention to press and was looking forward to it. As the match progressed it became more clear he's \"pressing\" for the sake of it, there was literally no intention to get the ball ever, he just stood close to the player in possession. Also another thing annoyed me, whenever he lost the ball instead of tracking back he just stood there complaining. I've never liked this attitude, but he was making people like me ignore it with his performances from the last 6 months I don't remember any instance where Vini has performed well in 3 matches consistently, one match here and there is all I see. Hes getting too stuck up on numbers Goals Assists, he doesn't pass the ball unless there's a chance to assist and loses the ball and when there's even a small 1% chance to score he goes for the shot, if the shot doesn't go wide or over the goal it's a simple save for the goalkeeper. I want to back him in debates with my friends but all I can say is he was the best player itw 2 years ago and just a shell of his past right now.",
