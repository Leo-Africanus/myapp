        "content": "I never used to believe in PR in football. I thought performances on the pitch spoke for themselves. But recently? The spin is hard to ignore \u2014 especially when it comes to Bar\u00e7a.\n\nJust look at this:\nI saw a post comparing Yamal\u2019s La Liga titles to Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s. No mention of Champions League football. As if La Liga is the ultimate metric now? When did we stop counting UCLs \u2014 where Ronaldo and Madrid actually built their legacy?\n\nEven worse, I\u2019ve seen takes like \u201cMessi destroyed the Ronaldo-Benzema era.\u201d\nReally? That same era where Zidane\u2019s Madrid beat MSN, won 3 UCLs in a row, and consistently showed up in big games? Somehow MSN is still glorified as the peak, and now people are acting like Yamal will \u201cdestroy\u201d this current Madrid era \u2014 based on one season?\n\nAnd the double standards don\u2019t stop there.\n\nLast year, when Bar\u00e7a were manager-hopping, it was called a \u201crebuilding phase.\u201d\n\nThis year, when we\u2019re dealing with a massive injury crisis and still competing on all fronts? Silence. No talk of transition, no credit for fighting through it.\n\n\nLook \u2014 I respect La Masia. They develop real talent.\nBut these kinds of narratives feel rushed and selective. If we win, it\u2019s \u201cexperience\u201d or \u201cluck.\u201d If they win once, it\u2019s \u201ca new golden era.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s not rewrite football history just to fit an agenda.\nMadrid\u2019s dominance is recent. It\u2019s real. And it\u2019s earned.",

        "content": "Now I am not saying he will be successful or jinxing it in anyway. I'm saying he fixes the key issues in our defense and reduces our flaws in that central defensive zone.                                                                                         \n\n1. He is a proactive defender so he likes to be aggressive with his defensive actions. So if the opposition counter attacks he likes to step forward to make the challenge therefore  not leaving them space and time on the midfield and defense gaps exposed and limiting option for the ball carrier. The major thing is that this is supported by asencio's recovery pace. therefore even if the flaws of a single centre back pushing to press the ball carrier can be expected (like bypassing huijsen), this can be nullified by asencio's recovery pace and ability.                                                                                                                                                        \n2. His aerial ability is gonna be a huge boost to our backline and our set piece chances. A 6'6 defender known for his high aerial duels won percentile is perfection needed right now for our team. Our teams struggle with aerial duels is no shock for us as we know other than 3 first team players, our whole team is under 6 foot.                                                                                                                                                                   3. \n3. Great at starting offensive plays. He is a driver with a ball. His quality on the ball is one of the best. One of the main things everyone talks about is his ability to dribble with the from his half to the oppsition half. This is key for us as we lack options to progressive the ball against high pressing teams.                                             \n\n4. well the known facts: he's spanish and young( hence more time to improve and pick up his game to another level, even if he stumbles in his first couple of months or a year in spain due to the new environment he has time to grow as he's just 20, 2 years younger than raul asencio and same age as arda).                Also remember give them time, most signings take time to recover their game or improve as its a new country, environment and tactics. Let's not be harsh and see how it goes.",

But how can we blame the board to not predict our entire defence being injured?).\n\nBut let\u2019s be real, papa Perez is the GOAT.\n\nLet\u2019s remind ourselves:\n\n- It\u2019s only May.\n- We\u2019re signing Trent.\n- We\u2019re signing Huijsen.\n- We\u2019ve signed Xabi Alonso.\n\n&gt; No departure fee for Don Carlo (compare this to the \u00a340m+ Man Utd paid to get rid of successive managers);\n&gt; Huijsen most exciting CB in the world for \u20ac50m spread over 3 seasons.\n&gt; No (substantial) fee paid for Xabi.\n&gt; Trent (the most offensive RB in the world) in his absolute prime for no transfer fee.\n\nThese are deals which the top Premier League clubs can only dream of. What an absolute legend.\n\n6 UCLs in 10 years.\n2-3 generations of Galacticos.\nRevamped stadium.\n\nThank you, daddy Perez \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc ",
