        "content": "With Vazquez struggling at right back I feel the team would benefit massively on the defensive end with Ascencio and Valverde covering that right side. Valverde can also have the freedom to push up on attacks where Asencio can shift to right back with Tchouameni coming down as center back to complete the 4 back. Valverde was having to stay back anyway due to Vazquez being a liability, so placing him there and giving him more help with a player like Asencio just makes sense. ",

        "content": "I have been a staunch Carlo supporter amidst the flood of \"Carlo out\", especially when there are no suitable immediate replacements.\n\nBut this is how you kill the confidence of a player who was thrown in at the deep end and held his own phenomenally. Tchou is not a natural CB, just got back from injury, looked really uncomfortable last match, and yet Carlo starts him over Asencio? Not only do you kill Asencio's confidence, you are yet again risking recurring injury on Tchou (was dreading him pulling a muscle the entire match). And if an injury did happen, we not only lose a great CB cover, but also our primary DM. I understand the thin squad is on Flo, but these preferences and heirarchy that have a high chance of reinjury is on Carlo.\n\nCriminal from Carlo and he should not continue beyond this season. Xabi or any other preferred manager has to come in.\n\n\nP.s. - this is not bashing Tchou. Rather a Carlo-bashing post. ",
