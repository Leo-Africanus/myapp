This setup fluidly allowed Tchouam\u00e9ni to support both midfield and defense, showcasing tactical flexibility and control. Those 2 matches makes me very excited for the future. \n\n For those who followed his work at Bayer Leverkusen, what happened after that unbeaten season? Why didn\u2019t Leverkusen maintain that same momentum in the following season? Was it injuries, transfer departures, or just the natural pressure that comes with high expectations?\n\nCurious to hear people\u2019s thoughts on both his recent performance and what went wrong after such a promising start at Leverkusen.",

        "content": "I think we all saw the recent reports coming in that Rodrygo wants to stay at the club, I was surprised at first as he seemed to definitely be leaving due to his lack of minutes at the CWC and all the buzz surrounding his situation in the media. However I think it's starting to make more sense to me and here's why : I think Rodrygo sees the writing on the wall that Vini &amp; Mbapp\u00e9 (in their current form &amp; attitude) can't coexist, and he sees that as an opening to secure a starting spot at LW ahead of one of them. He presses, works hard on defense which is something Xabi appreciates, his numbers are low but maybe he can improve under Xabi. Vini for example also has incredibly low G/As recently compared to what we usually expect of him, and doesn't even bother to do the work off the ball - something that Rodrygo is willing to do.\n\nI'm also quite concerned about Vini's contract situation, his contract ends in 2027 and neither him or the club seem to be budging on their demands. I believe that he has no right to ask for a 30m wage while performing the way he does and the attitude he's been showing, and I think the club might force him to make a decision this summer because if he doesn't renew, next summer he'll only have 1 year left on his contract and the club would lose a lot of leverage if he were to be sold. Maybe Rodrygo is aware of this and is waiting to see how it plays out.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",
