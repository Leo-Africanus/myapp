        "content": "I\u2019m honestly surprised by the amount of talk about sacking Xabi. Yes there are things to criticize for example, I genuinely don\u2019t understand why Fran Garc\u00eda is starting but turning on the coach this quickly is completely wrong.\n\nWe\u2019re watching matches where some players simply aren\u2019t delivering. Vini hasn\u2019t been at his best for quite some time. If Mbapp\u00e9 wasn\u2019t carrying us in key moments the situation would look much worse.\n\nPeople seem to forget what Xabi Alonso did with Bayer Leverkusen last season. That wasn\u2019t luck. That wasn\u2019t \u201cone good run.\u201d His team never gave up, remember all those late goals and last-minute draws? He won the league unbeaten with a club that was mocked for years as \u201cNeverkusen.\u201d That takes mentality, discipline and leadership.\n\nWhat worries me more than the coach are players who focus more on being flashy, creating social media moments, trash-talking. Remember Vini\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or post? Big words and then nothing to show for it. Now there\u2019s talk of contract demands that don\u2019t match recent performances.\n\nWe\u2019ve had players who talked trash before Cristiano did it all the time but the difference is simple: he always delivered. He never hid, never gave up and never let the team down when it mattered.\n\nIf there\u2019s a problem at Real Madrid right now, it\u2019s players trying to influence the dressing room instead of letting the coach lead. Xabi needs authority, not sabotage. Support him, let him impose his rules and if certain players don\u2019t follow? Bench them or replace them. This squad is full of players who are hungry and ready to make a difference.\n\nSacking the coach is the easy excuse. Fixing mentality is the real challenge.",

        "content": "It's not like his stuff never worked, his stuff worked. As long as we can press with intensity.\n\nbut he couldn't keep it for certain reasons. Even in the CWC he had used Fran Garcia quite well, letting him charge into the box to create threat.\n\nHe was also right to use Franco as RM to bring more balance/pressing and let Rodygo rotate with Vini as a LW, where he played much better. But things all changed.\n\nLike Rodrygo, Xabi was right to use him rotate Vini on the left, where he plays much better. And use Franco as RM to bring balance. But now he used him as RW and it didn't work well at all.\n\nIt has to do with his decision ,but most likely the dressing room also played the part, if we just fire him now. The problem would not be solved. I think his top priority is to let the players do what he had asked instead of being too easy on the stars and harsh on the youngsters(Endrick).  Remember 2019? Lopetegui was sacked so quickly also because he was too afraid to touch the star players. Solari could at least let the things work for a while because he had the balls to take off players and use youngsters. Till this day I still thank him.\n\nI really think a big mistake Xabi had made was being too easy on Vini after the Barca incident. I'm not saying Vini did something super evil or not playing well after. But no punishment(starting up in the Valencia game) simply let the players think \"hi we can do whatever we want without consequences\" Hiddink also mentioned it in the ESPN interview.\n\nWhat can save Xabi now is himself, he got to have the guts to do what he wanted the players to play, at the same time improve on the structure in time. If he couldn't do that, then he 100% would need to leave.",

        "title": "We have to get rid of the untouchables mentality",
        "content": "The biggest issue we have right now is the untouchables problem. We have a group of players who know they will start every game no matter how they perform. When players feel safe from being benched, intensity drops. They play without urgency, they stop tracking back, they stop making the extra effort, and the whole team suffers for it.\n\nThis is exactly what is happening with Vini, Mbappe, Jude, and Fede. These are great players, but they have reached a point where they are never held accountable. They know they will not get subbed off, even when they are having a bad game. That creates a culture where performance becomes optional. It is one of the reasons we struggle when we dominate possession. The players become too relaxed because they know nothing will happen if they lose the ball or waste chances. It doesn't click in their minds that playing like this will cause us to lose a game until the 80th minute. Then suddenly there is urgency to win.\n\nYou could see the difference in today\u2019s game against Celta. We only started playing well and actually running after the red card reduced us to ten men. Suddenly, the team had no choice but to attack with urgency. The reason we played well against barca is because they dominate possession therefor we are forced to attack the moment we win the ball. Urgency changes everything. When the team feels pressure, players push themselves. Without it, the effort drops.\n\nThe solution is simple and necessary. We need to make it clear that no player is above the club. If someone is playing poorly, they come off. If someone is not defending, they get subbed. If someone keeps losing the ball, they sit on the bench next game. It does not matter how talented they are or how many trophies they have won. Other top clubs treat their stars the same way. Even Yamal gets subbed when he is off his game. So why do we protect our players like they are untouchable?\n\nUntil we fix this mentality, nothing will change. Talent alone will not win us games when hunger disappears. The club must come first. Always. Hala madrid! ",

        "content": "Listen I understand that some of the players are part of the problem but please tell me how that excuses us getting outplayed by all of these teams? Just look at the liverpool game, he put cama on the RW and arda as a DM against szoboszlai and gravenberch, that's basically suicide, we stood no chance. And then against vallecano we couldn't create more than once chance, and the elche game was also bad. Against olympiacos we weren't even that good, and they would've equalized or even won if it wasn't for some great saves from lunin. That girona game was the worst match of football I've seen in the past few years. The bilbao game was good but they didn't play a low block and their defense is terrible, either way I thought it was good but today I got reminded that our coach still has zero solutions for teams that sit back. Elche beat girona 3-0 and we needed a pen to draw with them. At least last season carlo had an excuse since he had terrible defenders but there's no excuse for a coach with these players to be getting dominated like this. How can you look completely toothless against celta vigo at home?? He still doesn't even have a starting 11 and he makes terrible subs. At the end of the day a manager that gives 2025 brahim diaz so many minutes is questionable to me.  It's funny how he saw every team realize we only have attackers on the left and just shut us down, yet he NEVER gave endrick a chance on the RW. It's hard to feel bad for a coach like this honestly, but I'm not saying he should get sacked yet, I just don't like seeing everyone make excuses for him and act like he's been good or something.",

        "content": "Mourinho, Ole Gunnar, Rangnick, Ten Hag, Amorim. All of these recent UTD manegess have had many problems, but one is main, the player power is too much. Pogba, Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Harry Maguire, Dalot, CR7(only in 2022/23). These guys shouldn't start for United, but they did because of player power at the club, and because the managers don't have power or ego to not play them.\n\nAt this moment, we're going through something similar here. Vinicius making a mess on the field when being subbed agasing Barca after having a good game really soured relations. And his \"apology\" not even talking about Xabi. People say it isn't a big deal but just think of being disrespected in the biggest game of football and the apology you are owed doesn't even have your name.\n\nBut what's worse is, it worked. Vini has started every game and has been worse than mediocre.\n\nNot to dwell on Vini too much. Guler, and Valverde are still starting. I know we don't have Midfield options but using 2 out of form players in the midfield is asking for trouble\n\nXABI BENCHED MASTANTUONO AFTER MANY CHANCES BECAUSE HE WASNT PERFORMING. This is important. I know Mastantuono doesn't have any goodwill at the club but him being able to see this at the start of the season and not now is concerning.\n\nUsual points- no gametime to Endrick or Gonzalo, trusting Rodrygo to turn the game around after he has been benched for 6 months. Concerning managing all around.\n\nPoint is--  FIRING XABI AND GSTTING ANOTHER MANAGER EONT CHANGE ANYTHING. Time and time again, if you have 5 \"superstar level\" players, however much you try player power will prevail.\n\nTL;DR- Player power will ruin the club. Managers can't do anything if it's not someone like 2010 Mourinho or 2009 Pep.",

This stretch will reveal Xabi\u2019s adaptability, man-management, and tactical creativity in the same pressure cooker Carlo survived for years, making the comparison between the two far more legitimate.",

        "content": "Let\u2019s get one thing straight: Xabi isn\u2019t the problem. We\u2019ve already seen his ideas work; Castilla, Sociedad B, and Bayer Leverkusen all showed a clear identity, a consistent style, and a squad fully committed to his methods. The results backed that up.\n\nFlorentino hired Xabi knowing exactly what kind of football he plays. If he wanted the comfort of the status quo, then Carlo was already the perfect man for that job. Xabi was brought in to evolve the team, not repeat old patterns.\n\nThe real issue is that some players believe they\u2019ve outgrown instructions\u2026 that they\u2019re too good to actually execute what their coach demands. In the Club World Cup we saw the version of the team Xabi intends to build: fluid, attractive, and steadily improving. Even in El Cl\u00e1sico, the signs were there.\n\nBut injuries have wrecked the foundation. You can\u2019t build defensive structure when your back line changes every other week. We\u2019ve been fielding a Frankenstein defense since September. Injuries along the back line ruined Zidane\u2019s second stint, and they did the same to Carlo. Nothing new there.\n\nIf the rumors about a squad rebellion are true, then it\u2019s on Perez to stand publicly behind Xabi and send a message: the coach comes first. Xabi shouldn\u2019t water down his philosophy just to keep players happy. Adjustments are fine, but not at the cost of losing identity and authority.\n\nAnd let\u2019s remember, this isn\u2019t new. Zidane was despised by the Spanish media not because of results, but because he refused to play their game. He didn\u2019t feed them quotes or drama, and that hurt their clicks. Xabi looks cut from the same cloth, and the media can\u2019t stand that long-term. They\u2019ll spin narratives and stir problems whenever they can.\n\nThe season isn\u2019t over yet, and I still have full faith in Xabi to turn it around.\n\n",

        "content": "Camavinga or Arda Guler: Who will fit the Xabi project long term?\nMy take:\nIts 2016 all over again. Zidane had a tough choice to make between Casemiro and James Rodriguez. Fans wanted James, some news portals said the then attackers liked James too(more goal scoring chances for them), fans even called the Brazilian 'Cancermiro' but Zidane took a bold decision and chose  defensive stability over offensive threat. \nResult: The legendary KCM trio, one of the most successful periods in club history.\n\nThe Camavinga and Arda Guler story rings a similar bell.\nBut its different. Though James and Arda Guler are prolific #10s but Casemiro was a CDM and Camavinga is an all phase monster. \n\nArda Guler is good but out of the two only Camavinga is generational. Arda Guler is well liked by fans and Mbappe but Camavinga is not far behind, he is liked by fans and Mbappe is his compatriot. \n\nWhen the time comes, Xabi will have to make the big decision , it remains to be seen if he has the nerves of steel that Zidane had. I wish the decision comes sooner rather than later.\n\nTell me your thoughts.",

Dean huijsen is most likely to participate in the training session but there is no way he start after a long week out. Rudiger and asencio are our most likely centerback against city.",

        "content": "Yesterday We had 20 total shots with 8 on target. Celta vigo had 10 total shots with 8 on target. Are you not seeing the pattern there? We keep missing chances then have the audacity to blame the ref and manager for our losses. Happens every game this season.\n\nWe got lazy scumbags on the pitch that lack discipline and hunger (unlike xabi) pushing their individual success more than the team's. Its like everyone's main goal is to be in the highlights vid after the game. The amount of times vini recieved the ball and just ran out the pitch with it into a goal kick is ridiculous and people are letting it pass. The referee's calls were all correct cuz he knew what he was doing and he wasn't scared of the players and management teams. \n\nWe always try to convince ourselves that the ref is the reason we lost that game nd not that we were disgraceful, that bellingham and carreras screaming at the Ref right infront of his face is smart somehow. Bellingham went through this before he should learn better imo as much as i love him. Garcia and carreras were simply dumb, nothing explains you making 2 unnecessary and dumb tackles like that, run and scream at the ref's face and you expect people to support you for some reason? Everything that happened to us yesterday is completely on us and DESERVED.\n\nLook at the 2 goals we conceded, by far the most disrespectful goals we conceded this season. Look at what the players are doing. Not even Fifa NPC's can f*ck up that bad. First we blame the ref, then we point at the Negireira case, then we blame xabi and tell him he \"ruined\" us. We are LOST, the players are completely spoiled and in my opinion they deserve the kompany treatment, especially vini. Xabi's not even that tough but this spoiled generation makes it look like he is. \n\nBut it sadly looks like xabi's gonna get sacked if ywe lose the city game anyway, cuz of how braindead we and our players are. My opinion is that we bring in someone like mou or vincent who have  ridiculous attitudes towards anyone that disrespects them or the team.\n\nWe are F*CKED.",

        "content": "Reading the sub these days is probably the hardest part of being a Madridista. My dear friends, Vini is not 'washed'; Fede is not 'lazy'. They're just forced to play in a system that doesn't suit them. Players don't lose their calibre in a year, and miraculously find it under a good manager. \n\nFootball may appear individualistic to the naive, however, it is an incredibly tactical game. Blaming a player is akin to blaming a pawn for losing a chess match. \n\nXabi has been stubborn about his 4-4-2, while managing some of the world's best wingers. A 4-4-2 by design allows less space for the wingers, who often find themselves double-marked even before they touch the ball. It's painful to watch a player of Vini's calibre trapped in the box and forced to invert as a striker, and then get blamed for a poor performance. This stubbornness has led to the downfall of Rodrygo and the apparent inflation of Arda, who clearly needs more time to adapt to such a high responsibility. \n\nEven Gareth Bale, upon returning from injury in 2018, was benched for Isco to accommodate Zidane's 4-4-2. Oldies in this sub like me (beg your pardon) would all too well remember Isco's re-emergence under Lopetigui, whose setup is not quite dissimilar to Xabi's. \n\nWe need to revert to the familiar 4-3-3 (which Xabi is inept at), or it may take a year or so to get used to this Barcelona-esque system. Until then, I pray our players are spared the vitriol.",

        "content": "It\u2019s not just Xabi\u2019s fault. It\u2019s the players and  more importantly in my opinion, the constant injuries to the back line. Just when you think everything is clicking, someone or the other gets injured, and you can only do so much with key players out. Who would have thought that having two right backs in the squad still wouldn\u2019t be enough to get through even the first part of the season trouble free?\n\nI don\u2019t know whose fault it is, but Trent seems extremely fragile. He plays a game or two and that\u2019s it, it\u2019s over. Militao came back from two successive ACL injuries  and it\u2019s unrealistic to expect him to complete an entire season injury free. Rudiger was out injured for a long time. Now Huijsen joins the list as well,Alaba, Mendy..You get the picture.\n\nMomentum is a huge thing in football, and if something keeps disrupting it every single time, then there\u2019s only so much a coach can do.\n\nComing to the players, barring Courtois and Mbappe, no one is playing to the level they are truly capable of.\n\nOur fitness coach has a lot to answer for.These frequent injuries, in spite of having the best training and rehab facilities in the world, need to be looked at very seriously.\n\nUnless the overall fitness of the team is fixed, we are not winning anything for a very long time in my humble opinion.",
