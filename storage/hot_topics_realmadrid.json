You can blame Carlo if you have proof that they did advise the player not to play but Carlo didn't listen.\n\nDo you understand how insane some of you sound? His job is \"Manager\", not \"Doctor\".",

He has missed several great chances by choosing not to use his weaker foot, instead attempting to reposition his body to shoot with his stronger right foot. This often results in losing the ball or wasting valuable opportunities. I initially believed he was confident with his weaker foot, but it seems I was mistaken.\n\n",

        "content": "As the title states, i will be traveling to madrid for new years and it will be my first time there. I just saw that the valencia game has been rescheduled for january 2nd. My questions are:\n\nWould it be possible to travel by train to Valencia early morning, and come back to Madrid by train that same night after the game? \n\nHow do I go about buying tickets for this match?\n\nSide note: Does anyone know if the Stadium Tour is fully open again? ie: are we able to tour the locker rooms now?\n\nThank you all for your help, as a life long fan I really appreciate this community. Hala Madrid!",
