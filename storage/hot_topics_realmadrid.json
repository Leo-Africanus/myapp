        "content": "#FT: CASTILLA 3:1 GUADALAJARA \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#1\u00aa FEDERACI\u00d3N\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scorers/replays:** \n\n0:1 Salifo Caropitche 25'\n\n1:1 To\u00f1o Calvo (own goal) 45'+4\n\nSecond yellow card: To\u00f1o Calvo (Guadalajara) 47' \n\n2:1 Dani Mesonero 49'\n\n3:1 Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga 61'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**match updates:** \n\n1' - kickoff, vamos! \n\n17' - Y\u00e1\u00f1ez gets brought down in the box and Arbeloa asks for a challenge, but the referee doesn't change her decision of no penalty\n\n\u26bd 25' - goal for Guadalajara - Rivas gets beaten extremely easily by their winger, then Lamini makes a huge marking error in the middle, and Salifo can tap the ball in. Joan and Valde hugely missed due to the injury crisis with the first team\n\n\u26bd 45'+4 - GOLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - corner from the left side taken short - Mesonero advances into the box with technique and willpower and lays it off to David - he wants to take a low cross towards the first post, but it gets deflected by Guadalajara's Calvo into his own net \n\nHT - the absence of so many players due to the (yearly...) injury crisis in both Castilla and the first team is duly noted, especially the centre of defense between Rivas and Fati is looking very disoriented - but Castilla manage to equalise with the last kick and salvage a difficult first half\n\n\ud83d\udd04 46' - 2nd half underway, with Arbeloa trying to stabilise the defence by subbing on left back Lezcano for his Castilla debut for Mario Rivas, moving Diego Aguado to center back\n\n\ud83d\udfe5 47' - second yellow card for Guadalajara's To\u00f1o Calvo, who crowns his nightmare performance with a stupid foul on Palacios, already being on a yellow -harsh decision but not scandalous\n\n\n\u26bd 49' - GOOOOLLLL DEL CASTILLA - Golazo de Mesonero! He receives the ball in midfield with a lot of space, drives towards the box and takes a shot from distance, surprising the keeper low at the near post\n\n\u26bd 61' - GOOOOLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - huge misunderstanding in Guadalajara's defence after a long clearance by Castilla - their defender heads the ball past the keeper who was storming out of the goal, and Z\u00fa\u00f1iga only has to pick it up and tap it into the empty net! \n\n\ud83d\udd04 63' - Mesonero comes off after a MOTM performance alongside Palacios, coming in in their stead are Beto for his Castilla debut and Pol Fortuny\n\n\ud83d\udd04 70' - Fortea comes on for David\n\n\ud83d\udd04 77' - and the last sub, Castrelo on for Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga\n\n90' - penalty for Castilla after Manuel \u00c1ngel is brought down in the box \n\n90'+4 - after almost 5 minutes of reviewing, the referee overturns it - another correct decision by her imo, way too little of a touch on our player \n\nFT - Castilla with a second half of suffocating dominance and great dynamism from everyone including the debuting players - which is also partly thanks to Guadalajara being their own worst enemy, scoring an own goal out of nowhere, getting an early red card in the second half and gifting us the third goal on top. Castilla continue their good form and are 2nd for now, with the other teams at the top of the table still having to play\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 14:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Madrid\n\n**Referee**: Olatz Rivera Olmedo\n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 1, Matchday 16\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[LaLiga+](https://www.laligaplus.laliga.com/) (subscription - 14.99\u20ac/month) (only available in Spain)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-3-3): Fran Gonz\u00e1lez - Diego Aguado, Lamini Fati, Mario Rivas (46' \u00c1lvaro Lezcano), David Jim\u00e9nez (70' Jes\u00fas Fortea) - Cristian David, Manuel \u00c1ngel, Dani Mesonero (63' Diego Mart\u00ednez 'Beto') - C\u00e9sar Palacios (63' Pol Fortuny), Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga (77' Gabri Castrelo), Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez \n\nBench: Guille S\u00fanico (GK), Jacobo Ortega. \n\nUnavailable: Sergio Mestre (first team call-up), Joan Mart\u00ednez (first team call-up), V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as (first team call-up), Manu Serrano (injury), Jorge Cestero (first team call-up), Roberto Mart\u00edn (injury), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Rachad Fettal (injury). \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** WLWWD\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 4th | 25pt | 8-1-6 | 19:19\n",

        "content": "When we look under at underying data, from understat and fbref, we can find that they deserved more points than they have won. Only bayern are above them in big 5 leagues in xGD. We are good at chance creation. We are underperforming on xG because of wastefullness in front of goal from other players other mbappe. Also mbappe eventhough scored some bangers, having the most outside box goals, he also missed some sitters. I think xabi deserves atleast one year and vinicius has to be sold if dont renew and get a creative left winger with a high floor like yildiz or semenyo. If we get an organizer with like locatelli, who is under the radar in january and incoperate endrick into the side, we can win the league and go deep in the champions league. \nThe most important thing xabi has to improve is the in-game management especially the substitutes. Hoping for the better. All this injuries may be a good thing as we can see the players who have'nt plated that much on where they stand.",

        "content": "Usually, managers of clubs of this magnitude are sacked mid-season only when the season is already crippled by December, with no hope or ambition of a top-2 or top-3 finish.  \nWe are safely in the UCL, merely four points off the top in La Liga, with one El Clasico still remaining, multiple starting XI players injured for a long time now, not to mention our previously world-class athletes showing childish tantrums, having bouts of sabotage and hilariously poor form visible for all to see.\n\nAll of them are now vocal that they are coming back to their senses and will fight for the badge.\n\nThere are about ten points for Barcelona to drop from now until the end of the season, excluding El Clasico. It takes one or two moments of madness or a single injury to flip their season upside down.\n\nWe still have all our knockout games ahead of us, and we have already beaten Barca this season, so that monkey is also off our back.\n\nIs there even any sense in sacking Xabi when the board has already committed to transitioning into the tactical-meta era of football?",

        "content": "I'm asking because every week we see Vini, Mbappe, and Fran on the left, sometimes even cooking the defenders and midfielders out there while the box is completely vacant. It gets swung out to the right and they're... still sitting on the left. Inevitably, TAA, Valverde, etc looks up to cross and there's nothing to aim at. What do we do? We swing it back to the three LWs waiting near the touchline and usually leads to Vini or Mbappe trying to dribble 2 or 3 defenders and then the counter comes when they are inevitably shepparded into a dead end. \n\nThe commercial decision to get Mbappe while we had a top 5 winger already on the left has caused the rhythm of the team to completely break down unless the opposition presses and they have the space to work with. It's on the precipice of pushing out a second manager in a matter of months, and the attack will continue to do the exact same until we change something. \n\nMy question is, how long does that have to continue before the Bernabeu says enough and forces the board to change the front 3?
