Are we forgetting that when Mbappe was doing his best Hojlund impression for the first 6 months vini was the one saving us and he would have had about 30 assists if Mbappe wasn't going through whatever he was going through mentally? And yes his attitude needs to be fixed but at the end of the day despite mbappe missing all those chances we literally NEVER saw vini complain, not even once, and this is the guy people want out of the club? Yes, he's been average sometimes over the past 6 months but he still helped us a lot in different games like the last clasico for example where he gave mbappe 2 assists. He's literally played one game in this new era so far and now people want him gone, give him some more time, this is the guy that has saved us in the UCL multiple times.",

        "content": "Yes, first match under Alonso finished in a 1-1 draw, but finally we can see that Real Madrid has tactical ideology. We saw that team played in 3-2-5 formation with the ball, with one full-back tucking in to play alongside centre backs. In the first half, Arnold played as a attacking midfielder in right half-space, but he wasn't looking good. However, in the second half Alonso made change and got Arnold in defensive midfielder position. After that change, team looked good. I hope that Rodrygo and Vinicius could often get into 1 vs 1 against opposition's full-backs.\nYes, it is Xabi's first match as a Madrid coach, but we can already see changes. Some players doesn't have great understansing of half-spaces and positional play, but I believe that Xabi Alonso will get the best out of this team and I believe that we will see positional play. \nOne more thing. Remember that Guardiola's first season at Man City wasn't the best, but already in second season Man City was very, very scary team to face. Real Madrid will need some time to change and to adapt to new playing style, but it will worth it. Madrid is going to be one of the most dominant teams tactically.",

The teams performance was sub-par as a whole. He carried the team for past few seasons. Carried us at the start of this season as well while Mbappe was adjusting. (since Benzema Ballon d'Or season he's been our most creative player). Now all this hate?\nI get criticism for his attitude, because it's horrible and he has it coming, but he's our player, and he puts up numbers, we need to support our players. We can call him out on his antics all day and I'm all for that.\nWe can't be calling for people's heads after some bad games. When you look at the bigger picture, he's a crucial part of our team and won't leave.",

I think Camavinga, Tchouameni, Jude, Guler, Valverde, and Cabaillos are elite talent that will grow and develop at Real Madrid. I don't want any high profile players to join at the moment. I see what Xabi is doing and I'm very excited to see the team improve and better execute the ideas. I hope we don't sign anyone in midfield. I want to see Guler and Camavinga play more, learn, and improve. Becoming a great team with these names is 50x more satisfying than buying Wirtz or some most wanted midfielders at the moment. We should only buy first team players for positions we don't have (RB, CB, LB, ST)\n\n  \nLooking forward to watch more games under Xabi and see how the game changes. Last game I saw Courtois playing higher and providing passing options. We saw Huisjen as well driving the ball forward to exploit spaces left by 1:1 marking. The second half change of Guler gave us massive advantage and we completely dominated the second half, while also struggling to score.\n\n  \nWe also tried to play high press but didn't really do it well and Al-Hilal was able to get out easily every time. But I'm sure it will improve.",

Tchouameni is a lock at cdm and non negotiable but one or even two of the others have to go because we are in desperate need of a Kroos/modric type of profile in the midfield and it hurts to say this but it\u2019s the unfortunate truth.  Arda Guler needs to be a starter and we need someone like an Angelo Stiller to control the game from deeper(not Tchouameni deep)\nLet me know what you guys are thinking ",

        "content": "While a win would have been perfect, the draw is an acceptable result too, considering the state of our team.\n\nIf we had played our first game against semi-pros like Bayern did, it definitely would have made our team over-confident and they likely would have taken the group stages less seriously\n\nHad it been against PSG, we would have definitely lost badly and that would have destroyed the morale.\n\nAl-Hilal, despite being a Saudi Team, is one of the best teams in the Saudi league. They have some good players who can even play in Europe. Our struggle against them will definitely motivate the lads to do better. Although it was a draw, it was not one of those games where we were lacking overall energy and dangerous chances.\n\nWhile some of our starters definitely are under-performing ATM, the team is definitely more organized and I believe we will do much better in the next game. Xabi, for sure, doesn't have any favorites right now and we will surely see flexible lineups and tactics that adapt to our opponents and situations.\n\nPS: We haven't even used our Turtle yet.",
