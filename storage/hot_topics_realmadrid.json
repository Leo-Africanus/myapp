It\u2019s not a like-for-like comparison, but the closest I could find of a similar game used football.\n\nPerhaps in light of his weaker attacking start (compared to last season), is this a signal of how much Jude\u2019s stock dropped from his dizzying heights of 2023?\n\nP.S. Not a hate post at all - love the guy and think that, for what he\u2019s done, he got a lot fewer plaudits than he\u2019s earned, especially leading up to the Ballon D\u2019or ceremony.",
