Not only has he been resilient defensively, he's shown that he ia able to move the ball forward which is necessary in today's football. I hope that Alaba/Militao/Tchou coming back won't push him to the bench because he has shown that he deserves a chance. I also hope this motivates the coaching staff to be more open to trying talents from the younger team, the squad has been ravaged by injuries so this is the time to take a chance on these guys.",

Now I am hearing that mbapp\u00e9 and Jude are both out for the game and I just feel so gutted that my first game will be watching a very depleted lineup playing castilla players that I won't even know about... Even paid extra on the tickets to have a good seat closer to the dugout\n\nOf course I am happy to enjoy the atmosphere of the stadium and support my team regardless but just frustrating that I somehow managed to choose the worst match possible of the year.",
