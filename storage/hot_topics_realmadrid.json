        "content": "As a Madridista, the contrast between Vini Jr and Doku going up against Conor Bradley was honestly eye-opening. When Vini faced Bradley in the UCL, he just couldn\u2019t get going as Bradley anticipated almost every dribble and matched his pace, which really threw Vini off his game and halted a lot of our attacking threat. In the city vs Liverpool game, Doku stepped up against Bradley and it was a completely different fight. Doku\u2019s physicality and explosive speed were on full display; he bullied his way past Bradley with ease, absorbing contact and powering through tackles that Vini avoids due to contact. Doku didn\u2019t just rely on skill but pure athleticism, something that made Bradley look much less assured than he did against Vini. Analysing them back-to-back really made the contrast in their styles feel leagues apart.",

        "content": "Four main types of Control through playstyle \n1. Positional Control(tiki-taka), seeking to hog the ball, a DLP/Regista is an absolute must, in fact the more the merrier, false fullbacks,  ball playing cbs, etc (Prime Barca Xavi-Iniesta-Busquets, pass around till there is an opening )\n2. Spatial Control( Space Manipulation)- Not manipulating the ball, manipulating space, dragging out players subtly for through balls, opening space for others,, doesn't need the ball, A tempo manipulator is also needed to avoid predictability, but it's less about passing and more about football IQ in manipulating the football field's space, A modric type of player (Kroos-Modric-Casemiro)\n3. Territorial Control (High pressing)- Hustle, dueling football, immediate counter, absolute chaos control, a DLP is not necessarily needed, it does elevate the ceiling though(e.g Thiago Alcantra at Liverpool), but the requirements are workhoses in the middle and runners in attack for pressing and transitions.(Prime liverpool 2018-2022 that pressed everyone to dust), rotations needed to manage fatigue.\n4. Block Control - Italian football, a DLP (Pirlo) is also needed to launchpad attack and transitioning when opponents lose the ball (Prime Milan, Juve).\n\nI rank them as\n1. Spatial Manipulation- The Swiss army knife, perfect for most scenarios, though can be somewhat stale sometimes vs deep blocks(RM ucl run of 6ucls in 10 years\n2. Territorial Control- Perfect counter to positional football that requires perfection, might falter vs deep blocks without that incisiveness, Spatial battles can turn into battles of Individual brilliance (Liverpool under Klopp)\n3. Positional Control- Requires perfect execution for maximum result, best for teams that like to sit deep, but can be somewhat stale if the block stays too strong(Inter 2010 or if pressed super intensely(Pool-2019).\n4. Block Control - Prime Italian Catteneciao football, controls by denying central space, but surrenders some kind of identity, relies too much on opponents making mistakes to get counter opportunities \n\n\nOur historical sweet spot last 10 years was that Space Manipulation that didn't need the ball to control and worked like a charm in knockouts. Which kind of control mechanisms do you think this current squad should work towards pending when we get a DLP/Regista, though elite teams nowadays usually blend these control mechanisms with each other.",

With players like Zidane, Raul, Ronaldo, Robinho, Beckham, Baptista, Casillas, Ramos, Pepe, Marcelo... absolute club legends. Obviously, you don\u2019t remember how nobody believed in us in 2013/2014, that we could actually win the UCL. Obviously, you don\u2019t remember how everyone criticized Real Madrid for signing Modri\u0107, how that transfer was even labeled one of the worst in the club\u2019s history, and that the club supposedly wasted around 45 million euros on a totally average player.\n\nBut most importantly, you\u2019ve got foggy memories and don\u2019t remember how tough those matches were and how many times we had to come back from behind. Everyone acts as if Real Madrid used to step onto the pitch and completely dominate, being a class above every opponent. Which simply wasn\u2019t the case. Those were hard-fought victories, often after very poor performances, especially in the knockout stages.\n\nYou\u2019re spoiled and expect Real Madrid to crush anyone by several classes. Look at the 2021/2022 season, once again, nobody believed we could win, and in every single match we were the underdogs. Every knockout game was extremely difficult, and often we were outplayed. Same thing in 2023/2024.\n\nEveryone keeps saying we\u2019ve been playing \u201cnothing\u201d for the last few seasons, yet in those few seasons we\u2019ve won the Champions League twice and La Liga twice.\n\nWe lost 1\u20130 to Liverpool in the UCL group stage and everyone loses their minds... You\u2019re exactly the same type of people who criticized Real Madrid back in 2012: \u201cWhy is this guy playing and not that one? Why did we buy this player instead of that one? This one has to go, that one\u2019s a disappointment.\u201d Instead of proudly supporting the best team in the world, you\u2019re throwing crap at it. But history will show you were wrong.\n\nShow me a single team that has as many Champions League titles as Real Madrid. Show me a single team that has won 6 UCLs in the last 12 years. Show me a single team that has managed to defend the UCL title twice in a row under the modern knockout format. Let alone winning it three times in a row, a record that won\u2019t be broken for decades.\n\nReal Madrid has always had weaker seasons during rebuilds, and it\u2019s always proven to be just a matter of time before we ruled Europe again. Your pathetic analyses and dramatic comments like \u201cthey played absolute garbage,\u201d \u201cXabi is useless,\u201d \u201cextremely disappointed with the performance,\u201d etc., are laughable. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just this subreddit that\u2019s so toxic and spoiled and who\u2019ve only supported Real Madrid for a few years and don\u2019t know what a real crisis looks like or if this is now the standard kind of Real Madrid fan, but honestly, you should be ashamed.\n\nAm I happy with the way we play? No. But we\u2019re in a rebuilding phase, and Xabi has been coach for only few months. We\u2019re first in La Liga. We won El Cl\u00e1sico. We\u2019re the best-performing Spanish team in the UCL and quite possibly the only Spanish club that will qualify directly for the Round of 16. Yet all you can say is how terrible we play.\n\nPull your heads out of your asses and stop pretending to be professional football analysts, because you clearly have no idea what\u2019s actually going on.",

I\u2019m talking here about Gonzalo Garc\u00eda.\n\nBut after 16 matches between La Liga and the Champions League, all I see is a player who doesn\u2019t play \u2014 and when he does, it\u2019s only for the last 3 or 4 minutes, either to waste time or to give Mbapp\u00e9 a brief rest so he doesn\u2019t get injured in the final moments.\n\nI understand that Mbapp\u00e9 is the best player in the world, and that he\u2019s untouchable \u2014 but even when you\u2019re the best, that doesn\u2019t mean you have every solution. When facing teams that defend deep inside their box, why not resort to what I like to call the \u201cJoselu card\u201d? A striker who can score with his head when all other options fail, who can play one-touch football and cause chaos for defenders inside the penalty area.\n\nWhy not move Mbapp\u00e9 to the left when Vin\u00edcius isn\u2019t performing well and bring on Gonzalo as a center forward? Why not even substitute Mbapp\u00e9 himself in the last 15 minutes when he\u2019s trapped and unable to make an impact? What\u2019s the point of having a classic number 9 \u2014 physically strong and good in the air \u2014 if you\u2019re not going to use him in matches like yesterday\u2019s?\n\nWe all thought Xabi Alonso trusted young players, but it turns out Mbapp\u00e9 was only absent during the Club World Cup. His handling of Gonzalo has been deeply disappointing.",

        "content": "When we brought Mbappe, everyone was worried about the fact that he might bring with him those ego problems, the primadonna problems and all that type of stuff, there was even deliberate negative propaganda towards him from some users on this sub trying to portray him as bad as possible, I vividly remember a video from training were Modric and some of his teammates were laughing at him and joking,  Mbappe sort of made a gesture with his hand being pissed off and the conclusion of those users was: \"THAT'S ONLY THE BEGGINING GUYS, MBAPPE WILL RUIN THE DRESSING ROOM\" and all this type of stupidity, in the end we saw none of that, more than that Mbappe he seams/behaves/talks like a leader and is one of the few players in our team like  Tibu, Bellingham or Valverde that can grab the game by the neck and say \"nah we are not losing today\" does he has some tactical problems on the pitch of course he does, but this are tactical problems witch can be improved/fixed and not PERSONALITY problems like the followers of PLAYER X were saying( I won't even mention this fucking guy 's name anymore)\n\nNow while we were all worried about the ego of Mbappe, in our own fucking club we were growing and raising without realising a guy, THE X PLAYER ! witch was always acting and the behaving to say the least bad , but we didn't wanna pay attention to that cause the followers of THE X PLAYER were always shifting the blame towards Mbappe, and all this bullshit about \"PASSION\" and how much he cares about the club is just excuses to explain the complete and utter miserable behaviour, don't forget guys that this X player is the 3'd captain of the club, and this motherfucker DELIBERATELY is trying to sabotage his fucking manager, witch needs fucking support, witch needs help from his captains, but naaah, our guy doesn't do that, he doesn't give a fuck about his manager, teammates and club cause he's a selfish egoistical narcissistic prick.\n\nThe first Clasico that I saw was the 1-0 win on Bernabeu 2007/08 season when Julio Baptisa scored that beautiful goal, so I support the team from that period, and I've seen the conflicts, the Casillas one with Mourinho, CR with Mourinho, the Ramos one with Perez, Bale and Zidane, Isco and Solari blah blah blah all of them, but in all this conflicts and tensions in the dressing rooms I never had the feeling that those guys put themselves above the club or their teammates, do I think that Casillas has been naive and stupid to leak stuff to the journalists, yes, was Ramos and his agent brother dumb to not sign the contract ? 100%, but they were never acting like they are bigger then the club or trying to deliberately sabotage their teammates or managers. THE X GUY situation is different, the rubbish that Xabi said that the whole Clasico stuff was solved between him and the X player is complete false, or probably he thought that everything was solved but didn't understand yet with what type of person he is dealing with.\n\nThe X guy situation needs to be solved as fast as possible for the future of this football club, and when I say solved I mean we need to get rid of this narcissist fuck as fast as a serial killer would get rid of his victims . Every time we gonna draw or lose, the main questions from the media, the board, the manager and us the fans won't be about \"How can we improve the team ?\",\"How can we improve the tactics\", \"What Xabi got wrong in that specific game?\" etc. questions witch helps us to get better, to move forward and so on, the questions will be \" X PLAYER was subbed off is he happy ?\", \"X PLAYER wasn't subbed off, is Xabi scared to take him out? \", X PLAYER didn't play well why Xabi doesn't sub him off ?\" unnecessary noise for the club and the manager that is in a complete rebuilding phase with barely 2/3 leaders in the team and a bunch of players that are not good enough for what we want to build or are to young yet and you can't really demand a lot from them right now.\n\nThe X PLAYER is not a leader, doesn't deserve to lead this team and will never be one, the only way he can lead us is towards misery, toxicity and conflicts. SO CUT HIM OFF NOW!",

        "content": "What was the purpose of bringing in Trent? If Xabi refuses to ever play a traditional 9, while Vini and Mbappe play patty cake at the edge of the box, what is Trent offering to this team? It\u2019s definitely not defending, so what\u2019s the deal? \n\nHe came on against Liverpool, puts a ball into the box, and other than Jude, nobody there. Comes on today, gets the ball, looks up, and sees fuck all movement up top. We acquired one of the most creative fullbacks in world football without a clear target man. \n\nThe only time our attackers do make runs into the box is on the counter. Problem is 99% of the teams in this league play ultra low block, so that\u2019s pretty much useless. Might as well send Trent back to Liverpool. ",

It\u2019s not the players I want to discuss today, but the FANS of the individual players. Go on social media, all you\u2019ll see is Mbappe fans attacking Vini, Vini fans retaliating (and vice versa), then Arda fans jumping into the mix, with Jude fans ready to pounce as well. It\u2019s a shitstorm. We as a fanbase need to get it together and start uniting under the badge, not the individual players.",
