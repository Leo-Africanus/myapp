If that\u2019s you, I\u2019d love for you to try it for a week and tell me honestly if it makes your football conversations more fun or not.\n\nIt\u2019s built for small private groups - not a public forum, not a place to meet strangers.\n\nWhat it does:\n\n* A private squad space for your group (text + voice)\n* A persistent \u201clounge\u201d to talk anytime\n* Match-specific \u201cmatchrooms\u201d for individual games, where you can react together around that match\n\nIt\u2019s early-stage and I want real feedback to shape it. If you try it, you can reply here or message me directly and I\u2019ll respond.\n\nIf your group wants to keep a specific vibe (banter, analysis, casual), you can invite people accordingly and keep it tight.\n\nIf anyone\u2019s up for being an early experimenter, I can share the links in the comments or via DM.",

        "content": "I think mastuono, despite his huge signing fees, is not talked enough as a youngster(mentioned signing fees because with huge fees you get more attention). For instance, he has similar or better stats than Yamal had in the first 15 games. Maybe Yamal was younger than him so we can't really compare them. Arda was the talk of football community when he signed with us, his age-18 was the highlight. Mastuono being of similar age, I don't really see him getting similar fame others before him got.\n\nAnd, I personally feel he's the proper right winger we've got since Gareth bale, a left footed right winger. Like we also had rodrygo and he was nice on the right, but him being right footed always had us lacking something during games. Mastantuono helps in so much ways, creates a balance on both sides while attacking. He runs, presses, tracks back, passes perfectly,...RUNS. Maybe he runs too much at times, but he doesn't look under confident on the pitch, and the number of fck ups are quite negligible by him.\n\nI feel like we don't talk about him enough like we did about Arda or huijsen. Or even the football media don't talk about him enough like they did with the likes of Yamal or cubarsi or pedri, etc.",
