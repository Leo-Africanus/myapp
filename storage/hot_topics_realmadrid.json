Over the years we\u2019ve hosted watch parties, sent members to matches, partner with brands - the sort of things a Pe\u00f1a is supposed to do. We\u2019ve gone through the requirements on the official site and we\u2019re confident we meet all of them.\n\nThe issue is with actually getting a reply from the club. Every time we email the Department of Pe\u00f1as, we get one rather hasty reply asking for some info...and that's about it. No follow-up, no progress, fully ghosted. We\u2019ve tried different contact addresses, provided all the details and evidence they could possibly need \u2014 same story every time. It\u2019s been like this for almost three years now.\n\nSo, to those of you who\u2019ve successfully gotten your Pe\u00f1a officially recognized \u2014 is there another way around this, or someone specific we should reach out to?

        "title": "What Zidane Understood \u2014 and What Xabi Must Now Learn.",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/k6x1eim9gzzf1.jpg?width=286&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c21734048358b7a4475205150c3ec6aee425945\n\nI started following Real Madrid around the 2013\u201314 season, drawn in by the drama of the Gareth Bale transfer saga and the renewed intensity of *El Cl\u00e1sico* after both Bale and Neymar joined the Messi\u2013Ronaldo era. It was the perfect moment to become invested: Madrid finally achieved *La D\u00e9cima* and won the Copa del Rey, highlighted by Bale\u2019s iconic solo run in the final against Barcelona. The following summer reinforced the club\u2019s Gal\u00e1ctico identity, with the arrivals of World Cup stars James Rodr\u00edguez and Toni Kroos. On paper, it looked like the most talented squad in Europe, fit to win it all.\n\nThe reality, however, proved different. Despite an impressive run of 22 consecutive victories at a point, Madrid\u2019s form collapsed due to injuries, fatigue, and Barcelona\u2019s dominance under the newly formed \u201cMSN\u201d attack. The season ended without silverware and with Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s dismissal \u2014 a decision many saw as premature. Rafa Ben\u00edtez\u2019s tenure that followed was short-lived; his more conservative approach clashed with the squad\u2019s profile, and a heavy defeat in *El Cl\u00e1sico* ultimately led to his sacking.\n\nZinedine Zidane\u2019s appointment marked a shift not through major tactical innovation but through clarity and trust. His first major adjustment \u2014 introducing Casemiro for James Rodr\u00edguez \u2014 provided balance and defensive structure to a side overloaded with attacking talent. That single change transformed Madrid\u2019s season: they went from 12 points behind Barcelona to finishing just two adrift, and eventually won the Champions League against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.\n\nOver the next seasons, Zidane continued to prioritise control and adaptability over individual brilliance. Gareth Bale, the club\u2019s record signing, was gradually replaced by Isco during the run-in to the 2016\u201317 title and Champions League double \u2014 a decision rooted in maintaining midfield dominance. Even when Bale returned fit for the 2018 final and delivered a match-winning performance, his exclusion reflected Zidane\u2019s long-term tactical philosophy rather than form alone.\n\nZidane\u2019s departure and subsequent return in 2019 came during a period of instability following Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s exit. Although his second spell was less decorated, his decision-making remained consistent: placing trust in players like Federico Valverde and Rodrygo, even when it meant benching established names such as Modri\u0107, Bale, and James. His management emphasised balance, work rate, and team structure over star status.  Two players who were once considered fringe figures in Real Madrid\u2019s constellation of stars went on to become central to the club\u2019s 2021\u201322 Champions League triumph \u2014 a campaign defined by improbable comebacks against PSG, Chelsea, and Liverpool.\n\nToday, Xabi Alonso faces a challenge of similar scale, albeit in a different phase of Madrid\u2019s evolution. He inherits an immensely talented group led by Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 \u2014 arguably the defining player of his generation \u2014 and Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, already a two-time Champions League final standout and the club\u2019s new emblem. Around them, he has access to two of Europe\u2019s most gifted young midfielders in Jude Bellingham and Arda G\u00fcler. On paper, the potential is extraordinary; in practice, the task is complex. Like Zidane before him, Alonso takes charge of a squad that is not yet a complete, winning unit but one still in transition, balancing generational change with the expectation of immediate results.\n\nEarly signs suggest Madrid remain dominant against weaker opposition but inconsistent against elite rivals capable of matching their intensity and tactical discipline. Alonso\u2019s main challenge lies in turning a talented side into a cohesive, resilient team, which is something that requires time and trust, two commodities historically in short supply at the Bernab\u00e9u. The Club World Cup provided a glimpse of Alonso\u2019s readiness to take bold decisions. In the absence of Mbappe, his choice to start Gonzalo Garc\u00eda, a relatively untested forward, was emblematic of that. Garc\u00eda responded with four goals and six assists, earning the tournament\u2019s best player award and validating Alonso\u2019s decision to reward form and tactical fit over reputation. However, ever since the majority of Real's biggest players have gotten fit to drag themselves into contention, Alonso has ditched the promise of radical revolution and went by the Ancelotti playbook of alleviating his top stars. Early signs are this arrangement does not work for either player or manager - Xabi still has a not so ideal relationship with Vinicius, while his insistence at playing Mbappe at the expense of others has the possibility of creating deep resentment in the squad. In the midfield, while Arda Guler and Aurelian Tchouameni have raised their game much higher than before, questions still remain on whether the midfield has the right balance in tough games where opponents while exploit Real's vulnerabilities in possession. Garcia who is a handy forward profile required at Real has been completely sidelined, while Rodrygo has been reduced from a competitive bench option early on to a substitute.\n\nWhile internal club support is extremely crucial for Xabi, he needs to take a leaf from Zidane's book more than Ancelotti's. Zidane's work was not only crucial for sustainable success, it was a way of showing the board that had long considered only the Galactico template for success that there was no point in stacking up the best players if they were ultimately going to unbalance the team. That the success of the team relied on a balancing act of complementary squad profiling and man management. Currently while work rate is not an issue for the players, they lack the tactical unpredictability that defines great teams, while also lacking the in-game management that sustains them. Players like Vinicius and Valverde who are supposed to bring that experience and calm to the team lose it more often than others, while the XI is wildly inconsistent when it comes to implementing the game plan against stronger opponents.\n\nTough calls, which may lead to scrutiny and derisiveness at first, are crucial if Xabi wants to make sure he doesn't repeat the Ancelotti playbook in terms of being sacked. He needs to make sure the right set of players start. It may take a while, but we will start to see progress like never before. That is what Zidane understood - and what Xabi must now learn.",

He had left that position far behind before even coming to Madrid. Even at the 2020 Euros, when France had literally Benzema as a striker, they were still playing 3-4-1-2, with both Benzema and Mbappe as CF\n\nIt can also be seen that he has had better stats as CF too.\n\nCompare that to Vini, who won the best player in the world award(FIFA the Best) and came second in Ballon d'Or, being one of the main reason Real Madrid had their most succesful season since the 1960's, as a LEFT WINGER.\n\n  \nVini was straight up the best winger in football, for at least 3 years. Even now he has more G/A than any other winger in the world, except for Bayern's\n\n",
