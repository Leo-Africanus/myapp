When we are winning and smashing teams, they stay and when we don't, they talk big and criticise and switch clubs.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti was not our only problem. It looks like our players are just not there playing for the ball anymore.\n\nI watched every UCL game of us and our forwards barely track back and we cant string even 10 passes in line. There is no fluidity in the game and we always keep losing the ball\n\nLong passes in the box where there is no one to head the ball inside the net. It's like our players look lost and we cant see Mbappe or Vini as the X-factor anymore. It's like our players forgot passing after Kroos left our team.\n\n\nI am sure that Ancelotti would have requested for defensive reinforcements but maybe Perez denied this requests to save money to splash in the main transfer window. But blaming all this on Ancelotti is completely wrong. That guy is the best in what he does. His tactic isn't to smash 10 goals in a game but to simply win one anyhow. He is the  type of good old time manager.\n\nI respect Ancelotti and  I think he is in the conversation of all time best managers. A Carlo Ancelotti appreciation post.\nThank you boss, Adios maybe after this season.\n",

        "title": "Should fortea be given a chance the next game?/ squad building for next season?",
        "content": "Obviously no lord Vazquez as he\u2019s injured (blessing in disguise maybe.) and while the first choice would be Valverde I think since the season is now basically done for and we are definitely not winning la liga anymore, it might be time to give the academy players yk, an actual chance? We all know what happened in el Classico with Munoz and yes, it was a very VERY good chance and he probably should have slotted it in the back of the net I just can\u2019t seem to bring myself to blame him due to the circumstances of that game (hell I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he\u2019s had a nightmare about that miss by now, or is currently thinking about the miss and will think about it for a Long time).\n\nI\u2019m getting off track but I\u2019m sure most of us heard of fortea an actual rb who has been said to have an abundance of potential and is also said to be a very talented player and Is one of the starts of the castilla, and yet for SOME reason he just hasn\u2019t been given any chances at all. Would this be the perfect time now? I mean since Jacobo should be starting aswell I don\u2019t see why we shouldn\u2019t just give another kid a chance. I know some people here don\u2019t care about the castilla at all and only want big money names but really think about it for a second. \n\nThe club really only needs to make 3 signings to be at its absolute best again. \n\nNico paz (debatable)\nHujisen \nAnd carracas \n\nHear me out, if we bring these 3 players and use the academy more the squad could be built perfectly (but it\u2019s up to xabi ofc) I know this is real life aswell so it\u2019s obviously not as simple as \u201cbring them in and they\u2019ll fit in perfectly\u201d we signed Trent and Carvajal will return but who knows how he\u2019ll be like but we could have 3 options for rb Trent carvajal and fortea, and fortea is super young so he wouldn\u2019t even have to be registered. Same with cb, joan Martinez will return and hopefully get more gametime and yea the acl will hurt him but he\u2019s very young so I think he could push thru it, not to mention Jacobo, if he plays well the next game he might get lucky and do an asencio, but that\u2019s if he plays well. And including all the other defenders we\u2019ll have 7 (but who knows with militao and alaba anymore.) \n\nBasically what I\u2019m saying is that I feel like the squad really doesn\u2019t need an instant panic button of signings besides defenders (and maybe Nico paz) because we need like 2 players from defense and trust the academy a bit more. I know people also want a new st but idk why we would need one if xabi is going to the play 3-5-2 but who knows. \n\nThats all I have to say, im curious on what you guys think about my idea, if its an interesting one, or if im the dumbest fan in the server who pretends like real like is like fm or fifa. \n\n ",

He completed four training sessions during the week, but his feelings weren't particularly good.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti decided to include the Brazilian in the squad for the match against Barcelona in an attempt to protect a player who has been very important in the Italian's four seasons in charge of Real Madrid. But since last February, his importance, in terms of his contribution to the game, has disappeared. Curiously, this season began with doubts due to the BMV issue, but he managed to turn things around. However, this time, he wasn't included in the plans during the week of preparation for the match.\n\nRumors and doubts about his future:\n\nThe substitution in the Cup has been a definitive blow to his morale, to which have been added the numerous rumors that have appeared about his future, which has led to a situation that is not to the liking of the footballer.",

        "title": "How do you think about Mourinho, Zidane and Ancelotti's coaching style?",
        "content": "I think Jose is very strict with tactics and details. You can see very quick counterattack style in most of his RM games. Everyone was doing what they were told. He is also good at making in game changes. He always wanted to win all the trophies.\n\nBut other than dressing room(he was good at encouraging players and got zealous followers, but sometimes players can't endure his management), his style would suffer setback when the opponent found its weakness-choke Alonso and right flank being too unstable. He also realized problem and bought Modric, but couldn't fully rebuild the system around him.  He tried to further improve his tactics but in the most crucial game, he still went back to his old style and this is a big reason he was going downhill afterwards.\n\nAlso I think he went a bit too far with \"beating Barca\", remember the 2012 UCL semi? He subbed out Ozil after 1-1 to save energy for the El Clasico and we got owned by Bayern. Even if we lose that El Clasico we still lead the league!\n\nStill I thank him a lot to take down prime Barca and rebuild confidence.\n\n\n\nAncelotti is quite the opposite, he didn't have very strict discipline(maybe other than a few positions like DLP).  His style is quite fluid, can use nearly all the superstars well. Much Like Del Bosque. \n\nBut he was \"too nice\" to the players and didn't like to rotate squad. He didn't have a very clear season plan like Jose or Zizou. So sometimes when they got tired/injured, we will see very awful games. Among these 3 coaches' era, the best and worst RM games are all from Carlo. The players sometimes also went too relaxed and lost discipline after a successful season.  \n\nAlso he doesn't like to use young players unless they are really good. He doesn't easily build confidence on them.\n\nCarlo's 2nd spell improved a lot on tactics and in game changes. Last season we saw very good defense discipline. But this season it didn't work well.\n\n\n\n\nZizou probably has the best balance among the two. He has discipline of defense and possession but doesn't go over the top with it. He can use nearly all the players well, even James did fine when he got chance to play. \n\nHe also has a very clear mind with rotation, even if we don't have a squad with depth. So his team can have the best form in big games. \n\nZizou's mind is very clear in big games. And his control of the dressing room is like witchcraft, even in 20-21 the team was able to fight till the end. And the 17-18 UCL win also showed his magic both in the dressing room control and tactics.\n\nZizou is nearly perfect for the coach of RM but not as the manager, if you give him the power to buy/sell players he would make bad decisions. Like Hazard and keep Marcelo. But overall he is still great.\n\nWhat do you think?",
