I saw Yamal and, yes, he's really good and creates a lot of chances, but he misses a lot of passes, too. He makes unnecessary and useless dribbles, and attempts crosses that get nowhere. However, I see madridistas all the time showering him in praises they never have for Vinicius.\n\nVini has been an incredibly effective player for years and he has been doing that in high profile games as well. But he gets trashed over and over because of his misses, like his good plays didn't exist. Is it really that difficult to show him more support than what is shown to the rival?",

        "content": "honestly, i'd still prefer klopp over xabi. he may not have a huge trophy record, but his game control, tactics, and man-management are top-tier. carlo is good too, but i feel he\u2019d benefit brazil more than madrid. his hesitation to trust academy players and young signings is a major drawback. still, he's not clueless\u2014he took a broken team, never complained, and brought us this far. that shows he's competent. now that the brazil move looks unlikely, i\u2019d still choose him over xabi. if carlo leaves, then klopp is my ideal choice. i respect xabi\u2019s unbeaten run last season and his passion for madrid, but paying both his and carlo\u2019s exit fees could be too much, especially with talk of signing trent, a new cb, and an lb. and yes, with a solid backline, carlo could easily outperform xabi\u2014maybe even try out new attacking setups, which he couldn\u2019t do this season due to a broken backline.",

One of the most annoying parts of TwitterMadrid was the constant rumors from bad sources. People take them at face value and react as if they were facts.\n\nLet's build a community around our love for this club, let's have honest discussions, enjoy/suffer through the games together.\n\nI think there are other avenues for rumors and made up \"news\".",
