Playing him as Number 10 would be akin to playing Xavi Hernandez as Number 10, sure he can do great and has all the ability but the team would suffer a lot in the midfield and recovery transitions when we will lose the ball. Arda is a machine in releasing very deadly passes between the lines and has that Number 10 technique through and through in turning, feint and making the markers life miserable. He is not good in getting into CM positions to provide a passing option when the pressing is too fast paced. IMO, Jude can still switch with Arda when our wingers have the ball and Jude has to crash the box. Then Arda can go deep. \n\nBut, playing from the back , I truly believe Arda has to stay in front of Jude just behind Mbappe.",

If the relocation happens (with success) , others will follow. Therefore, fans must speak. The best way to do so is during El Clasico, when a lot of football fans around the world and casual fans (at least in Spain) will be watching. In Germany, their fans manage to stop owners from doing stupid actions. I hope it will happen in Spain. And if players feel supported by fans, it will be easier to sit out this game.",
