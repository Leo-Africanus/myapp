I support Chelsea and I have seen downfall many times in my lifetime as a Chelsea fan, the biggest one came in 2022/23 season where we finished Below 10th. That was pretty embarssing\n\nMan Utd is a perfect example of a top club facing downfall, they dominated in 90s, 20s and even early 2010s, but since fergie their downfall started and it's not stopping anytime soon\n\nReal Madrid are a top club and always have stayed there, I just wanted to know that when did real Madrid faced their worst downfall? And what are the reasons that real Madrid never face downfall and consistently have competed with top clubs?",

He is Tier 2 mainly because of his closeness with Florentino Perez.\n\nMost voted comments:\n\n**\u00d3scar P\u00e9rez:** Vini is a good player. Fast, good in one-on-one situations... but in his position, the best is Mbapp\u00e9, and Vini doesn't accept that. Mbapp\u00e9 has been able to adapt to his position and continue performing at a high level, while Vini does whatever he feels like at any given moment. They say it's easier to get rid of one player than twenty-five... so maybe it's time to transfer Vini and address the team's needs.\n\n**Luis Serra:** When you indulge a child's every whim, overprotect them, always portray them as a victim, and never call them out on their bad behavior, they grow up to be an irresponsible, completely self-centered, arrogant, and conceited person, utterly lacking in self-awareness. The entire Real Madrid community\u2014the club, the fans, and the paid media\u2014you have created a monster that is now devouring you.

        "content": "Did you guys read this caption. How obsessed is fabrizio with him. He literally had no reaction today after being subbed off but this guy is posting as if he was throwing a tantrum. And how dumb are people in the comment section. Fabrizio never posts about Negreira case though there were many new updates recently. He would never post about messi\u2019s brawl when he choked an mls coach. But hell this guy would post shit like this. ",

        "content": "I did a bit of research and I have found out that RMA won the league only once while in a deficit of more than 2 points after Matchday 18 in the 21st century. That was the 02/03 season where Real Sociedad was first with 3 more points than RMA after MD 18. Last season after the same number of matches played we had 1 more point than this season while being first. Now with 42 points we are sitting at 2nd place just shy of Barca that has 4 more points. Do you think this team has the capacity to overturn this deficit and win La Liga despite having a not so bright first half of the season?\n\n[Won the league that year despite the deficit of 3 points](https://preview.redd.it/gm2ozjyfim8g1.png?width=345&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e144e8fcb58b27b4b7708ed0a4040b1bf56aa25)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/maeapiksim8g1.png?width=350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1b84d1fa6dd3f0ebb70c95d6a3109bbad1c80e2\n\n[this season just to compare a bit to last season](https://preview.redd.it/w80izckwim8g1.png?width=687&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4db29497041dcd8e95ec427812888dfdb48af055)",
