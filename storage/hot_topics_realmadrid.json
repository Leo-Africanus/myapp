        "title": "After matchday 5 of La Liga, I compiled data for all teams about \"Fouls Drawn\" \"Fouls Committed\" \"YC drawn\" and \"YC received\". This is how the data looks like, and some insights",
        "content": "Some key insights:\n\n**Yellow cards per number of fouls committed:**\n\n* Barcelona picked up a yellow card for every 10.2 fouls committed. This is the highest Fouls per YC received in la liga so far. Valencia and Alaves close seconds\n* Real Oviedo picks up a yellow card for every 4.5 fouls. Girona is close behind with 4.7\n* Real Madrid picks up a yellow card for every 6.57\n* Average for La Liga is 6.8\n\n  \n**Yellow cards drawn per times fouled:**\n\n* Barcelona oppositions receive a yellow card for every 3.87 fouls on Barcelona players. This is the lowest. Alaves is second with 4.47\n* Real Madrid oppositions receive a yellow card for every 16 fouls on Real Madrid players. This is BY FAR the highest number of fouls before a yellow card is shown. Sevilla is second with 12.67\n* Average for La Liga is 7.4\n\n  \nData source: [https://www.thestatsdontlie.com/football/europe/spain/la-liga](https://www.thestatsdontlie.com/football/europe/spain/la-liga)\n\nI never used it before but I checked some random teams and data seems accurate. I got from there the number of fouls and YC\n\nFun fact there have been 1266 fouls in 5 matchdays\n\nCompiled the rest using good old Excel :D\n\nI will run the same exercise on Premiere League and see how it looks like.",

        "content": "Yes, Vini had a bad season by his own standards, but the hate is ridiculous. People are way too quick to call him a bum when his \u201cdown year\u201d still looked like this: 21 goals and 15 assists in all competitions, 8 goals and 2 assists in 12 Champions League matches, a spot in the La Liga Team of the Season, plus an average rating of 7.6 on FotMob and 7.39 on SofaScore.\n\nThat\u2019s elite output, even if it wasn\u2019t his very best. The bigger issue was the team as a whole, no clear style of play, shaky defense, and no rhythm. Of course, Vini looked less explosive at times, but let\u2019s not pretend he suddenly became useless.\n\nNow compare that to how Bar\u00e7a fans treat Pedri. In 2023/24, Pedri struggled for form, didn\u2019t make the La Liga Team of the Season, and his ratings were lower than Vini\u2019s 2024/25 ratings. But were Bar\u00e7a fans calling him overrated or finished? No, they defended him, hyped him up, and waited for his return to form. Meanwhile, Vini drops a 20+ goal, 15+ assist season and people act like he\u2019s some fraud.\n\nThat\u2019s not how we should treat our own players. If this is his \u201cbad season,\u201d just imagine what his peak looks like. Let\u2019s back him the way they back theirs.\n\nIf this is considered a \u201cbad season,\u201d just imagine what happens when he hits top form again.",
