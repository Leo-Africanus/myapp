        "content": "I see a lot of people shifting the blame onto one or two players to explain the disaster that was last season and this season, but we\u2019re not looking at the bigger picture.\n\nThe board sets the standards for the team and decides who has authority. After we won the Champions League in the 2023\u20132024 season, our most important player for the team\u2019s dynamics left (Kroos). The board basically set Carlo up to fail when they didn\u2019t sign a ball-controlling midfielder or any center-backs, even though we clearly needed them due to the high age ceiling and Nacho leaving.\n\nThis season, Xabi still didn\u2019t get a ball-playing midfielder, even though he explicitly asked the board, and now Modri\u0107 has also left. We\u2019re left with a midfield that can\u2019t pass the ball if their lives depended on it. Regardless, we still started the season relatively well until the Cl\u00e1sico happened. We were winning, Vini got substituted, and then he acted like a fuckinh 25-year-old man-child clown. Regardless of whether you agree with Xabi\u2019s decision, that doesn\u2019t give him the right to act like that.\n\nBut fine, we are still 7 points ahead. Vini would get his lesson and we will move on\u2026 except we didn\u2019t. The board decided to back Vini, saying he shouldn\u2019t have been substituted, and basically endorsed his behavior. From that moment on, you could feel that Xabi lost control of the team. Things started going south, and we ended up losing everything.\n\nThis is obviously not all the reasons, but most of the problems we suffer from can be traced back to the board.",

I saw a tweet bashing him for being at a party shortly after the Benfica loss. And this wasn\u2019t just some small tweet, it had about a million or so views and counting. Quotes full of people mocking/ridiculing him. All that just for the picture used in the tweet to be a picture from 2024\u2026 This is the news our fanbase is consuming (and believing) day in and day out.\n\nAnd don\u2019t let it be a player who\u2019s currently disliked (such as Vini). When people who already don\u2019t like a player see negative news about said player, all critical thinking goes out the window. That post affirms their bias so they\u2019re not about to go fact checking or commit real thinking on it. Textbook confirmation bias. If it\u2019s drama you want, there\u2019s plenty of reality TV out there for you, but I guess it doesn\u2019t quite scratch the itch of spreading false narratives of a player on a team you love and support.",

So what do you think the real problem is?",

        "content": "Seeing this video makes me realise that all real Madrid needs is a midfield that is fast paced with passing and movements. It's exactly what Modric said once \"I learned that the quicker play moves, the less physical the game will be. When the game moves fast, you have to think fast. When it slows down, it gives physical players a chance to get close\". Our current midfield is just so slow on the ball like oh my days.\n\nSee this video with Prime Madrid plays like the speed of passing and counter attacks is crazy.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHvN4oCSfj4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHvN4oCSfj4)\n\n",
