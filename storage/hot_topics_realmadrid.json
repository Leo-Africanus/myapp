Right backs always injured Our Main CB is injured .\n\nAs vini and mbappe doesn\u2019t really track back and help defence the midfield gets overwhelmed and players like jude and camavinga needs to do much more work and jude gets overwhelmed with all the tasks he has to do\n\nI think it is the media which is overly focusing on the problem with ego .\n\nIn reality the 3 peat Madrid with bbc and kroos casemiro and modric wouldn\u2019t survive if they had this defence.\n\nThe defence is all over the place that is the main problem.\n\nEven when we played the last ucl semi finals vs City which was undoubtedly the most inform and best team of that time we won because our defence was rock steady.\n\nLast season even under Carlo we had to play vasquez as right Back Tchoumeni as Centre Back and constant defensive worries made us loose a lot of games\n\nThis stat backs the claim as well\n\nReal Madrid have conceded 80 goals in 67 games in 2025, the second MOST of any team in the top-5 leagues. Only Tottenham Hotspur (83 in\n\n59) have conceded more.\n\nMedia just points at things where they get the most views from\n\nWhat do you think about this ?",

        "content": "Yeahyeah everyone is probably tired of the talk but i want to put my two cents in. This isnt a vini or mbappe problem either is a play style problem. There is no identity in the club. We arent a creative team and arent a counter attacking team. Yeah we counter well but thats just when the opportunity opens itself up. \n\nThere is no fluidity in the team. We hold the ball and dont do anything will it. There is no triangle passing in the team. The off ball movements are terrible. Everyone passes and stands there after, noone passes and moves to  get open for another ball. Only pass side to side in the back and try to take it up a wing and it is just bad play. \n\nVini and mbappe have been shit at dribbling and pass recently. Mbappe scores goals but dude has trouble making a simple pass and he has been getting stopped on more dribbles than not. \n\nIm glad trent is back because i think he will be a massive boost to the squad with how he passes. \n\nWith all that said 7 wins in a row playing ugly ball is impressive and can definitely win the league this year",

        "content": "Hello there!\nBarca fan here and I have a question. I started following football during 2010 WC when I was 8. I was mostly watching casually till 2017/18 but I always supported Barca. I saw least years of Messi's Barca journey and some games before then. So I was too young to able to see Figo play. I know he was our captain when he left and I'm wondering how good he was. Was he better at Barca or Madrid. Did he meet expectations and do yall consider him a Madrid legend? \nTy for reading and your answers.",

        "title": "So this sub is going after Mbappe?",
        "content": "Look at this sub page over the past 24 hours or so. It\u2019s littered with a bunch of videos going directly after Mbappe. I don\u2019t think you have to be a genius to realize why that is. Are Vini FC fans really this insecure that they have to relentlessly target Mbappe when Vini doesn\u2019t play a single match? In all seriousness, how many times do we have to have this nonsense Player FC chat on here? Why so many people on here continue to attempt to individualize collective team problems to a single individual is mind boggling. \n\nBigger picture, the back line in front of Courtois has been a shambles for several seasons between injuries, aging players, new inexperienced players, and not enough synergy between any one unit. In front of them, Perez never replaced Kroos and Modric with tempo setting midfielders who genuinely control and dictate matches. Too many of the current midfielders are athletic and able to cover lots of ground. But are not the technicians of Kroos and Modric levels who know when to speed games up, slow things down, and keep things ticking. \n\nUp top, Mbappe, Vini, and Rodrygo all prefer to operate from the LW area. We all know that. Of the three, yes, Mbappe is the most effective attacking wise operating from the left side space. You only have to look at his career numbers to very quickly realize Vini and Rodrygo are nowhere close to Mbappe\u2019s output. And I\u2019m also talking about operating from wide areas as well as a winger. Personally, I think Mbappe operates best from a floating role going across the front lines. With Garcia playing ahead of him as the striker. As for Vini, his one real move of kicking it past the defender and trying to beat them for pace has been found out. Vini visibily looks slower than several years ago and his separation pace looks diminished. You only have to go back and look at highlights from several years ago and compare him to now to see that it\u2019s quite obvious. And he never allows the LB to get forward to work with him. As for Rodrygo, he very likely wants out but knows Madrid is as good as it gets for him. We will never see the best of him playing from the RW. Which is a shame because he\u2019s a very good player.
