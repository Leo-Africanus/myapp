        "content": "Regarding the Schottlerbeck Signing, I think it would be a good move from our side to get him or someone like him. \n\nSome may say we already have Huijsen - a slower ball playing CB - so why get another? Well the reason is because injuries and suspensions happen. And also, loss of form (as we've seen in some games for Huijsen).\n\nIf we're going to implement a system, a style of play, that system has to be fault tolerant. It can't break down because 1 player in a certain position is injured. There should have a backup for every important player in the system\n\n\nIf the system requires a ball playing CB, there must be a back up for him. If it requires a conventional no 9, there should be a comparable back up. \n\nWe can't play different systems each game cos of an injury or suspension. We should only change our style if we deem it fit for the opponent we are playing. Otherwise we should have an identity and have the squad to stick to it. \n\nCurrently only Huijsen is a ball playing CB. When he doesn't play we either suffer or we have to find solutions in Midfield which are not always there. ",
