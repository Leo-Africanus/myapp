        "content": "Matrim Neto from Elche\nFerm\u00edn from Barca\nOur turkish ozil\nCarlos from Levante\nJavier Guerra from Valencia\n\n\n1. Matrim has one assist so far this September with 2 game played.\n\n2. In September's La Liga fixtures, Ferm\u00edn L\u00f3pez\nproved highly effective in limited minutes. Across 194 minutes and four appearances, he scored two goals, showing sharp finishing with 6 shots, 4 on target. Creatively, he contributed 3 key passes and posted an expected assists (xA) value of 0.32, highlighting his growing influence in Barcelona's buildup play. Technically, he was tidy on the ball with an 85% pass completion rate, and dynamic in duels, completing 9 of 12 dribbles (75%). Defensively, he added 6 tackles and 1 interception, showing balance between attacking flair and work rate. Overall, September confirmed L\u00f3pez as a lively, impactful presence in Bar\u00e7a's midfield rotation.\n\n3. Carlos \u00c1lvarez enjoyed a breakthrough\nSeptember with Levante, standing out most in the\n4-0 win over Girona where he scored his first La Liga goal from a free kick and influenced the attack with sharp link-up play. Across his September appearances, he registered 1 goal, 1 assist, 0.5 expected assists (xA), and 4 shot- creating actions, reflecting both creativity and efficiency in limited minutes (194 played). While quieter against Betis and struggling for space against Real Madrid, his passing vision and pressing energy remained consistent. Overall, September showcased him as a young playmaker\nbeginning to translate potential into real output.\n\n4. Martim Neto has quietly become one of Elche's most effective midfielders this September. In limited minutes, he showed strong creative output, recording 2 assists, 1.1 expected assists (xA), 5 shot-creating actions, and 3 goal-creating actions. His progressive passing (5.2 per 90) and dribble success (1.6 per 90) underline his ability to advance play under pressure. While he has yet to score, his vision and composure on the ball made him a consistent link between defence and attack. September confirmed Neto's role as a reliable playmaker - not flashy, but quietly\ndecisive in Elche's midfield structure.",

        "title": "Xabi Alonso's Next Formation",
        "content": "The Madrid derby will be the first time Xabi has to make a choice in the midfield. During the CWC, pre-Bellingham surgery, he's been able to get away with playing 4 midfielders by putting one of them at RW. Now that Jude seems ready to start again, he will now have to make a choice on who to bench between Arda, Tchouameni, Jude, and Fede. \n\nHe could, obviously, play Arda at RW, and bench Mastantuono, but both players seem more suited for the current positions they are playing now (Arda at RM/CAM and Franco at RW). And, as I'm sure is evident to Xabi and everyone else, Franco is much better in the team press and has better work rate at winning the ball back in dangerous positions. So, it comes down to a case of does he want to play with a RW or not. \n\nIf he does, then it poses the question: which MF should be benched? Certainly, a great problem to have, but with how the guys have been rolling lately, I figured I should pose the question now that the reality of the situation is before us. ",
