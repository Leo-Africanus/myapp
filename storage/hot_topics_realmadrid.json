But he still had a lot of potential and to some extent has proven that he is a top talent.\n\nHonorable Mentions: Gareth Bale and Isco. I didn\u2019t include them because they contributed and have their own legacies but they had potential for even more.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Any players that come to mind?",

It\u2019s almost impressive how obsessed he is\u2014La Liga could be burning, and he\u2019d still be online blaming Real Madrid before sunrise.",

Of course I think we needed another CB but maybe aguado can fill that role seeing as dortmund wanted him yet the club insisted on keeping him, and also having academy players succeed is a very positive thing for the club and fans overall. Now, successful academy players means nothing if we don't win anything though lmao so we'll see. Also I didn't include Joan Martinez because he's still recovering from the ACL so I doubt he'll be with the first team that much this season",

Also considering the scenario in which rodrygo stays that means endrick could possibly get less minutes than last season since we might be playing with 2 attackers. It's really sad to see honestly because endrick is better than gonzalo (except for aerial ability) and has the potential to be insane, he literally saved us in the copa del rey and had 5 goals in 5 games",
