Huijsen shone with composure beyond his years, Milit\u00e3o\u2019s return was encouraging, and Arda showed glimpses of magic.

Room for improvement, absolutely, but this is the first game for Pete\u2019s. We endured years of high blood pressure matches that we either won last minute or lost/tied. At least here we were in full control of the match.\n\nHere are some things to take away from the match:\n\n- We got 3 points against a very stubborn opponent with basically 8 men defense\n\n- No injuries and long term injured players are back in full force. Militao &amp; Carvajal looked great out there.\n\n- Depth in the squad like we\u2019ve never had. People also aren\u2019t playing out of position. Everyone in their favorite spot.\n\n- Super solid defense with barely any mistakes. No highway spaces like before. Huijsen and Tchou were great. Trent needs to gel in better but Carreras looked very promising and I see a Marcelo spark in him.\n\n- Much faster ball recovery and press.\n\n- Balls to sub Vini for Garcia. This is a huge point for Xabi\u2026 no one is protected from being subbed or rotated.\n\n- Rotate all players. Again, this is something we really lacked. This will keep our players fresh for the long season.\n\n- Trust in youngsters. Not just for the last 5 minutes. ",

Anyway, all I'm saying is, we created good chances, we had shots on target, Mbappe was great, Franco was good, Hujsen is looking great, Vini is still just average, but atleast thats better than being trash. I'm not saying don't panic, I'm saying don't panic FOR NOW. We can criticise after 6-7 games. We played quite well for a team that had such high defensive pressure. Our plays will just get better, we got this. Hala Madrid!",

At the start, he missed easy passes, missed penalties, even looked like he couldn\u2019t handle pressure. People wanted him sold, saying he was destroying the team. But he kept working, kept improving, and in the end he won the Pichichi. Those same fans went silent.\n\nNow it\u2019s the same story with Xabi and the team. These plastic fans don\u2019t want to wait. They just want to bash players and push their own agenda. One bad pass, one slow game, and they start crying.\n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s new players, a new system, new tactics, and a new manager. You all want to judge everything after just three weeks of training? We all know the biggest danger in the league is losing points. That\u2019s what matters most. Beautiful football is nice, but points win us the league.\n\nYes, we are lacking in some areas like the final third. And yes, the coach is experimenting in his early days. But that\u2019s part of the process. Let them breathe, give them time, and trust the project.\n\nIn Real Madrid, I believe.\nHala Madrid.\n",

I feel like he wasn\u2019t given a particular clear role or any instructions yesterday. He played in a kinda like a 10 position for the first half. Where he was really like nullified. He was on the ball more in the second half. I feel like his best position is on the right hand side of the midfield with Guler operating in the centre. Yesterday I felt like he was one player with the least impact for the team with Trent . This is not a criticism at any point by the way I know how much he means to us we all absolutely adore him.

        "content": " Carreras - He was a sight for sore eyes as he was the brightest among the new signings and we finally have a left back with attacking threat.\n\nHuijsen- Confident on the ball and had few cracks that will eventually lead to golazos later. \n\nTrent - He had an average game but i think he will grow into his role as he was too cautious and not as adventurous as i know him to be. Had a few good crosses but was tentative with his approach to the game.\n\nMastuntaono - His brief cameo  was eye catching, i thought he will struggle being that young in his debut but he changed the game with how he dictated play and was demanding the ball at all times.",

        "content": "Hear me out before yall flame me, Mbappe  the way he plays he often drops back to help with temmates in mid. I was wondering if he drops back as a false 9 and Rodrygo/Vinni drops inside when this happens. We're struggling to make plays of the wing anyways. This might create better options.\n\nLets say we're outside the box when this happens and he cant get a pass out then he can take a shot on net with his insane skills. \n\nMbappe definitely has the playmaking ability to accomplish this. I wonder if Xabi will try to use him this way as well. ",

        "title": "Hot take : the midfield needs a lot more ballers",
        "content": "I hope I\u2019m not the only one noticing a lack of technical quality in the midfield. \n\nTchouameni is very good at recovering balls and providing some stability in the midfield, but whenever this guy has the ball at his feet, I\u2019m just scared about what he will do to be honest. \n\nThe same can be said about Valverde. Yes he spends so much energy on the field, he can break lines with his runs, he can track back and recover balls. But balls at his feet ? He hasn\u2019t stepped up technically in the slightest to make us forget about Kroos\u2019s absence. \n\nOur midfielders can only control the ball and make simple passes. No line breaking passes, no tempo controlling, no switch of play\u2026 Guler used to do all of that when he was in a lower position, but yesterday Xabi put him in his usual position (10/false 9) and his teammates couldn\u2019t pass to him. Of course it went this way because Osasuna were playing low block and cutting off any pass lines leading to our dangerous players, but if we had more technical players in the midfield, we would\u2019ve created more opportunities than that. \n\nBellingham\u2019s absence is obviously a problem, he\u2019s basically our only other midfielder who\u2019s comfortable on the ball, press resistant aside from Guler, and I think we need to build our midfield on these two for the future. Valverde and Tchouameni must improve their technicality imo or we\u2019ll have to put one of the two on the bench. Look at the midfields of the strongest teams in the world. PSG, Barca, Liverpool\u2026 they all have three highly technical players in their midfield. Yesterday, we had only Guler and he was too high on the field to create plays. We\u2019re gonna have to build the midfield around Bellingham + Guler, and find something that works around them, but I\u2019m not confident with the players that we have. ",

Vinicius was starting to dribble again and tried making chances today and some people are saying \"Oh Vini Mbappe isn't going to work.\" Mbappe is literally our Centre Forward, how do you expect him to find spaces when there are 2 to 3 players always surrounding you? And then there are those players who say \"Rodrygo &gt; Vini.\" Yeah sure. If he ever gets gametime. No disrespect to Rodrygo but what is the point of comparison when the guy is uncertain about his future at the club? Yes he is a great dribbler but Vinicius also performed better than the dogshit he was dropping since the past 6 months. We just have to be patient it's the FIRST MATCH of the season. ",
