But what do they want the new 9 to do? Isn't score goals? Or the idea is to replace Mbapp\u00e9 (which is what people are saying) with a 9 that assists? Isn't obvious that having the top scorer is a good thing.\n\nI get that Xabi should think about using a striker that dominates the aerial game, but that cannot be to replace Kylian, but to complement him.\n\nI honestly don't understand how so many people share this opinion. It's insane thinking being the top European scorer is somehow a bad thing.",

        "content": "I think most of us are already dumbfounded about how xabi has managed this team since after the CWC. It\u2019s understandable somewhat because we had a good start of the season until now but recent performances cannot go unnoticed. \n\nTalking about today\u2019s game, holy shit was there even a game plan? And what were those subs? Not only were they so late but he brought on two players we absolutely didn\u2019t need for that game. We have Endrick and Franco who can play RW but he does Brahim and Rodrygo \ud83d\udc80 why did he even start. And wtf is the point of Trent coming on in the 85th minute? He should\u2019ve started let alone barely get anything. Bro was signed to watch from the sidelines. Valverde was holding his hamstring for like 10 minutes too. Mbappe must have Xabi hostage for being on that field for the full 90\n\nOnto the main point which is the 352. Most of our players had their best games in that formation. Trent as RWB, Valverde as RCM (we do NOT want to see him in the pivot again \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f), Tchoua as the CB/CDM hybrid role. Guler and Bellingham also played really well tg too, now they both just want to be 10s. After Endrick goes on loan we won\u2019t have a competent RW. And we actually had players inside of the box and aerial threat. Why has Xabi completely ditched this formation? It worked out so well and the players that we have are best fit for it, Xabi was seriously genius for setting it up like that. I don\u2019t know what goes on in his mind every time he plays 433 it just doesn\u2019t work with our team as it NEEDS creativity which we DON\u2019T HAVE! Does he watch the same games we are watching or is he in another universe?? I hope when he finally starts Trent (if he even does) he\u2019ll feel compelled to use it, maybe after the break when tchoua is also back. \n\nI want to iterate that I am not overreacting but just pointing out the flaws. I still trust in Xabi and know we will get better as the season goes on I just hope he has full control of the team and it\u2019s not Perez putting a gun to his head, or maybe should hope for that so we know it\u2019s not him lol and Perez gives him the freedom. A draw is a draw and we move on. Hala Madrid!",

If Xabi refuses to ever play a traditional 9, while Vini and Mbappe play patty cake at the edge of the box, what is Trent offering to this team? It\u2019s definitely not defending, so what\u2019s the deal? \n\nHe came on against Liverpool, puts a ball into the box, and other than Jude, nobody there. Comes on today, gets the ball, looks up, and sees fuck all movement up top. We acquired one of the most creative fullbacks in world football without a clear target man. \n\nThe only time our attackers do make runs into the box is on the counter. Problem is 99% of the teams in this league play ultra low block, so that\u2019s pretty much useless. Might as well send Trent back to Liverpool. ",

Anyways xabi was making team play well with 3-4-3, but after CWC he changed to 433 or 442, we are very good defensively, exclude Liverpool and Athleti match, that may be due to inexperience in defensive line, but I am happy with overall defence, but during low block we need to play a proper striker.\n\nI guess board doesn't make him allow Playing 3-4-3, or maybe because of Mbappe's arrival.\n\nIn my opinion(this is purely my opinion): Vini has been dropping stinger on the left, its like he doesn't have a single braincell for decision making, dude has immense talent but his decision making is some times shit, taking on 3 players at once instead of passing and moving forward. I think instead of making Vini competing with Rodrygo, they should make Vini compete with Mbappe on Lw, and in striker Gonzalo or Endrick, or play Endrick in Right wing until Eminem comes back.\n\nYesterday we were just passing and passing and passing nothing in final 3rd, we were playing like headless chicken.\n\nI saw a post saying Perez supports Vini than Xabi, he didn't like the Vini Substitution, that's why we didn't see Vini get substituted. Xabi should be allowed to do whatever he wants, he is senor, and coach.\n\nOur team is good, but to be greatest only few more tweaks and that's it.",

I think G.Garcia should start so we can see more from him especially since this next game should be an easy win. I put mbappe on the rw cause he's clearly capable of playing there, not to sure of the midfield tho just wanted to see what you guys thought. Just tried to have a civil convo about my criticisms for madrid with a fellow fan on tiktok and he decided to be delusional and just respond with a pic of previous matches where we won against barca as if that's all this club should care about. He seemed to think that just cause we beat barca, we could beat anyone and win the ucl(even though it's very very obvious that id we keep playing the way we play against big teams, we are definitely not winning the ucl) Please feel free to share your thiughts WITHOUT being rude",

Since Adidas is having a great sale on last year's stock, this is the perfect opportunity to upgrade. If I purchase the authentic version also in size L, will it simply fit a bit tighter and more tailored than the replica L, or will the difference be significant enough to warrant sizing up?\nI am strongly leaning toward the authentic jersey because, to my eye, they simply look 100 times better than the standard, normal ones. The quality of the materials, the heat-pressed crests, and the overall slimmer cut make them a much more premium item that I'd love to add to my collection while the sale lasts. I need to be sure about the fit before I commit to the purchase.",

The goal looked like offside to me, and it came off a free kick that was never a foul and even a yellow for Y\u00e1\u00f1ez - the end of this first half could not have been more frustrating\n\nHT - an incredibly unjust result after a first half that has seen Castilla create, but miss a number of chances, as lapses of concentration in the defense by Castilla allow M\u00e9rida score with their only two opportunities, in the shape of a center back that has now doubled his total career tally with this match. A big reaction needed to forget these disappointing minutes by the team\n\n46' - second half underway \n\n\ud83d\udd04 57' - Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga off for Bruno Iglesias \n\n70' - phenomenal save by Fran from a short distance after M\u00e9rida's Chiqui runs all by himself into our box on the counter \n\n\u26bd 73' - absolutely no words, Valdepe\u00f1as wants to play the ball back to Fran, but completely mishits it and lobs it over him into our own goal. Schoolboy error to even play the ball straight at goal, and a grave technical mistake on top. A match to quickly erase from the memory for Castilla\n\n\ud83d\udd04 74' - Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez off for Leiva\n\n\ud83d\udd04 86' - Joan and Palacios off for Manu Serrano and Mesonero \n\n\ud83d\udfe5 90'+5 - disgusting and disgraceful challenge by David Jim\u00e9nez, who kicks the M\u00e9rida player into the knee on purpose. This should be a lengthy ban for him, which is especially painful in the absence of Fortea, leaving the team without a right back \n\n\ud83d\udfe5 90'+5 - a big fight breaks out, with even the police on the pitch, Manuel \u00c1ngel gets a red card\n\n\ud83d\udfe5 90'+8 - for some reason, Arbeloa asks for a review despite the clarity of the red card, escalating the situation further. Palacios said something to the referee, and he also gets a red\n\nFT - a disgraceful, unprecedented end to this match and to Castilla's winning streak. With potentially multiple game bans coming for Jim\u00e9nez and Manuel \u00c1ngel, and likely a single match ban for Palacios, this match might just ruin the next stretch of matches as well. Arbeloa needs to keep his team in check, this cannot ever happen again. The fact he challenged the red card at the end, letting things escalate even further should make him question himself in the process too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 12:00 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Romano Jos\u00e9 Fouto, M\u00e9rida \n\n**Referee**: Rub\u00e9n Ruip\u00e9rez Mar\u00edn\n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 1, Matchday 11\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[LaLiga+](https://www.laligaplus.laliga.com/) (subscription - 14.99\u20ac/month) (only available in Spain)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-3-3): Fran Gonz\u00e1lez - Diego Aguado, V\u00edctor Valdepe\u00f1as, Joan Mart\u00ednez (86' Manu Serrano), David Jim\u00e9nez - Jorge Cestero, Thiago Pitarch, Manuel \u00c1ngel - C\u00e9sar Palacios (86' Dani Mesonero), Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga (57' Bruno Iglesias), Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (74' \u00c1lvaro Leiva) \n\nBench: Guille S\u00fanico (GK), Mario Rivas, Lamini Fati, Cristian David, Pol Fortuny.\n\nUnavailable: Sergio Mestre (first team call-up), Jes\u00fas Fortea (injury), Roberto Mart\u00edn (injury), Hugo de Llanos (injury), Rachad Fettal (injury). \n\nCoach: \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** WWWDW\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 4th | 18pt | 6-0-4 | 13:10\n",

        "content": "I keep seeing people say that mbappe's the reason why vini isn't performing as well as he used to, are we serious? When mbappe was in the worst form of his life last season, vini was still playing insanely well, and as a matter of fact that was probably his best start to a season (idk for sure, I don't feel like checking). My point is, vini was carrying this team at the beginning of last season but then after he got injured around november/ December, he's been nowhere near that level. Even in the CWC when he had Gonzalo next to him he was even worse than he is right now. His decision making has dropped significantly along with his passing, which is tragic but it's the truth. So blaming mbappe for that is just cope. Vini still has his good games every once in a while but in general he's been average for a whole year now, I hope he can bounce back but that might not happen.",

Why!? Perhaps that position is not right under the desirable spots of fame; if this is not about skills and fairness, then here should be called Circus Real Madrid\u2026\n\nAfter everything, all I see here is still Mbappe should be there, Vini should be here or Bell should do this, Rodrigo needs more time bla bla\u2026how much more time guys? these guys, believe me, are given everything possible; materially and spiritually\u2026they can dribble, shoot or simply walk\u2026without consequences\u2026I dont mean they are not great players but we obviously need to change the organization and traditional balance of the team even if it may hurt some players and some of fanboys\u2026\n\nAs it was said at the beginning, it is coming to a point of making bold decisions and creating a system based on merit and factual data, not on aristocratic bullshit or on sleazy dreams of a bunch of man-worshipping fans\u2026",
