        "content": "It might be a bit early to talk about Ancelotti's replacement since we still don't know if Don Carlo is gonna be our manager next season or not. But there are so many posts all around social media about \"who's gonna be our next manager\" and I noticed that many Real Madrid fans seem to be unimpressed with Xabi Alonso, maybe because he probably won't win the Bundesliga title for the second season in a row.\n\nI understand if you prefer another manager to take this job, but criticizing Xabi Alonso as a manger doesn't really make any sense. \n\nPeople don't realize that Bayer Leverkusen finishing this season as \\*\\*2nd\\*\\* is actually another big achievement for Xabi as a manager. We're talking about a team that was 17th after 8 games in 2022/23 and Alonso managed to carry this team to finish 6th and play in Europe. To win the league title (UNBEATEN) one year after. And now he will most likely finish in the 2nd place which is HUGE for a team like Leverkusen.\n\nBelieve it or not, since 2002/03, Bayer Leverkusen only finished in the 2nd place one time in 2010/11.. only one time in the last 23 years! And many of us are not impressed with Alonso this season?\n\nWinning 3 titles with a team like Leverkusen in 2 years. Reaching Europa League Final. Being Top 6 in the UCL league phase this season... I don't know what else he should do to prove that he's the right manager for us after Carlo!",

I even called Real Madrid support line to ask where to buy the away tickets and they said I need to buy it from Arsenal because Real only sell tickets for matches being played in Bernabeu.\nThe 3rd party sites are selling tickets for \u00a3600 each which is very expensive.",
