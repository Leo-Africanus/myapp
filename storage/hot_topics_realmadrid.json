Mbappe was never a target man and we all knew that. Vini's form in inconsistent but we can't ques his potential. Rodrygo on the other hand has been great for us playing as a sub but at this point he also wants regular game time and his preferred position is left as well. \n\nLast night as well we didn't have a threat on right wing hence it was predictable for liverpool . Ofc they were better than us and the we couldn't match their intensity. \n\nXabi is new as well and ancelotti have spoiled us by giving us 2 champions league with limited players he had and it has the downside as well which we saw last year in the form of injuries. we have been lucky with ancelotti and i don't know if luck will be on our side with Xabi or not but one thing that is certain that we need to sign players based upon our needs now. \n\nIt's our responsibility as fans to trust in Xabi because he knows his players and what to expect from them . We have certain set of players and by bringing the best out of them , we can have a goood season. Yesterday was just a bad game for our players and it happens once in a while tho we can't forget that we lost again liverpool , psg , arsenal and Barca 4 times last year and this year as well we have lost to Atleti and liverpool ( 2 big teams we faced) . Barca isn't a strong team right now and Juve is also a mess.",

        "content": "Considering the next few matches are against teams that are mid table and also the dead last one so far, Girona, it would be very stupid to continue using the main starting XI with barely any rotation or rest.\n\nAfter Endrick got those 10 minutes in the match against Valencia, and Mastantuono being injured, I think it would be fair to give him some more time. Gonzalo could come in for Mbapp\u00e9 after 60 minutes, especially if Mbapp\u00e9 has already scored once or twice.\n\nThese next few weeks could be great for testing new tactics and positions for players, and I'm worried that instead we're gonna get the same two or three systems that allow Mbapp\u00e9, Vini and Bellingham to stat pad, only for the next big match to be a let down when the team suddenly only has threat on the left wing or doesn't have a centerback that can handle physical pressure.\n\nIt's a great sign that the team is winning so much at this point, but if the crucial matches go like this, it might mean that some new things need to be tested",

The former footballer explained that crosses and attacking moves were left without a finisher, an obvious tactical gap.\u00a0**\"Sometimes you need to go and test the defender. There was no one in the box for the crosses. Maybe you need a \u20189\u2019\"**, he concluded, hitting the nail on the head regarding the role of a classic striker.",
