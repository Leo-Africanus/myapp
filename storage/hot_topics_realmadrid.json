        "title": "The Referees' Technical Committee needs to be sued",
        "content": "It has been awhile now that referees in La Liga have been incompetent, I don't even think incompetent is an accurate description, they literally have every single tool at their disposal yet they consistently fail at doing their principal job, most have have seen amateur refs oversee a game better than these PROFESSIONAL refs. If the field ref doesn't see it, fine, they have people scrutining every goddamn angle possible, plus they radios that they can use to communicate with each other, they have the best kits, socks, boots, goal line technology, VAR, EVERYTHING they need to accomplish their jobs. For the life of me, I don't see how people say that these refs are getting paid, they are CLEARLY too fucking stupid to even cheat properly. This is not malice or corruption or anything, this is UNINTELLIGENCE. \n\nUnder any other circumstances, if you hire someone to do a job and you pay them the budget equivalent of most countries on the planet, you can sue them for damages if you could show that you\u2019d experienced a financial loss as a result of a contractor not performing their duties and referees are often independent contractors. However, whether a referee is an independent contractor or an employee depends on the level of control the association has over them. I don't know what if La Liga refs would be independent contractors or employees.",
