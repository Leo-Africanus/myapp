        "title": "Can We Still Win LaLiga? A Statistical Look at Our Best-Case Scenarios",
        "content": "Hola Madridistas,  \nI\u2019ve been doing some math and thinking about how we could still win LaLiga this season. Honestly, there's not much we can do directly except **win every remaining match** \u2014 and even then, the title still depends on *Barcelona dropping points*.\n\nSo yesterday was Matchday 33, where both Real Madrid &amp; Barcelona won. So the current point table is like this, and the point gap is **4**\n\n* Barcelona - 76\n* Real Madrid - 72\n\nSo in the league, there are 5 matchdays left this season, with one El Cl\u00e1sico. There are many possibilities, but I'll go through the most likely (or our best-case scenario) ones.\n\n**1. We win all 5, including El Cl\u00e1sico | Bar\u00e7a wins 4 (losing El Cl\u00e1sico)**\n\n* Barcelona - 76 + 12 = 88 pts\n* Real Madrid - 72 + 15 = 87 pts\n* \ud83d\udd34 We will lose the title by just one point.\n\n**2. We win all 5 | Bar\u00e7a wins 3 (incl. losing El Cl\u00e1sico)**\n\n* Barcelona needs to lose both El Cl\u00e1sico and one more match.\n* Barcelona - 76 + 9 = 85 pts\n* Real Madrid - 72 + 15 = 87 pts\n* \ud83d\udfe2 We will win the title by two points\n\n**3. We win all 5 | Bar\u00e7a gets 3W + 1D + 1L (losing El Cl\u00e1sico)**\n\n* Barcelona - 76 + 10 = 86 pts\n* Real Madrid - 72 + 15 = 87 pts\n* \ud83d\udfe2 We will win the title by just one point\n\n**4. We win 4/5 | Bar\u00e7a wins 4/5 | El Cl\u00e1sico draw**\n\n* Barcelona - 76 + 13 = 89 pts\n* Real Madrid - 72 + 13 = 85 pts\n* \ud83d\udd34 We will lose the title by 4 points\n\n# TL;DR\n\nThere will be lots more cases, but in my opinion, these are the best chances we've got. So here are some insights in my POV (just my thoughts)\n\n* With the current situation, the only thing we can do is win all the next 5 matches (including El Cl\u00e1sico somehow) and pray to some other team to defeat Barca.\n* If we lose the El Cl\u00e1sico, the title is gone 99% because I can't see any Barcelona defeats in the next matchdays with their current pace.\n* Even if we somehow managed to win or draw El Cl\u00e1sico, the title still relies on Bar\u00e7a dropping points.\n\nYeah, that's it. Our chances are pretty low but not zero. If we keep managing to win the CdR final, it will boost the title race, I think. So either we win both CDR and LaLiga or...\n\nPlease mention if any details above are wrong or mistaken by me.\n\n**\u00a1Hala Madrid!** \ud83e\udd0d",

His biggest issue is that he easily gets distracted by issues during the game when he shouldn't (not talking about racism, of course). Defenders and fans can easily get under his skin and mentally isolate him. Unfortunately, we haven't seen him improve on this aspect and I believe that was critical in some games and made us suffer. \n\nAt the same time, we need a no.9 like Haaland who is fast, sharp, and clinical in front of the net. \n\n\n\nWhat are your names?

WE ARE JUST FANS. NONE OF US ARE QUALIFIED TO TOUCH THE GRASS. PLEASE DONT BE SERIOUS.\n\n  \n\\-----------\n\nMy Real Madrid GEGENPRESS football. 90 min press with super high defense line that relies on offside traps and physicality to harass forwards.\n\nLineup is 3-4-3 -&gt; 3-3-1-2-1 in possession : [https://imgur.com/a/njaWOAO](https://imgur.com/a/njaWOAO)\n\nAscensio and Rudiger as Wide Center Backs with Tchouameni in the middle organizing the whole line and playing the ball to midfielders in the build up.\n\nValverde and Camavinga as wide midfielders, defensively they support the backline and press the opposition wingers/wingbacks. Offensively they present passing options in wider spaces and cover some of the central spaces forward as more players move into the box. They can also play more centered and form the midfield trio with Guler while Rodrygo and Vinicius play more wider roles.\n\nGuler and Bellingham are my main engines in the midfield. Guler is the creative outlet and Bellingham is the work horse. Guler will hold the ball more often and link with the wide midfielders for options forming a midfield trio (Cama, Fede, Guler) while looking to unlock the defense with killer balls to the final thirds. Jude will move forward with and without the ball and form a trio with Rodrygo and Vinicius. He will be a Muller-esk Ramdeuter.\n\nVinicius and Rodrygo are the central forwards. Flexible in positioning and expected to play close together with Jude. Synergy is needed for one-two passes that unlocks any deep defense. But they are also expected to dribble and shoot as much as possible. Expected to press hard when out of possession.\n\nMbappe will have to turn into a Poacher. His job is to lock defenders with him and finish any half chances we get. The team pressing high and crowding the edge of the area will allow lots of balls inside the box. Kylian is expected to pick them up. Expected to press hard when out of possession.\n\n  \nPlaystyle will be a high intensity passing with players generally being close to eachother. Beating defense with dribbling and one-two link ups. NO FUCKING CROSSES.\n\n  \nHow many goals do you think we will concede?\n\nHow many injuries per season?",

        "content": "And yes, I've watched Casillas in his prime years between 2007 and 2012. I've watched Keylor Navas and even Diego Lopez that I actually loved. I think we've always been lucky when it comes to goalkeepers. Even Lunin was brilliant for us last season.\n\nBut honestly I've never felt safe with any other GK like I feel these years with Courtois. Except for his first season, I think Courtois has been the most consistent keeper for us. Casillas, with all respect, used to have some obvious flaws, like dealing with aerial balls and crosses (he was very poor with his feet as well). Navas was a bit inconsistent comparing to Casillas (in his prime) and Courtois, but I have massive respect for him too.\n\nCourtois is just perfect in every possible way.. his 2021/22 season might be the best that I've ever seen for a GK, especially in Champions League. His performance against Liverpool in the final is unmatched, in my opinion. \n\nHe will never play over 700 games for us like Casillas, and he might not end up being the RM keeper with most titles. But in my opinion, he's the best that I've ever seen.. and in my Top 3 GKs of all times (with Buffon + Neuer). I hope he still has 3 or 4 more years in him, because replacing him will be hard.",

From my hopes of it could be Madrid Treble season, to loosing all hope to a point where I feel we would go wont win the copa finals, and would be difficult to secure the league win unless barca loses a game and we beat them in the el classico. What do you guys feel Madrid has a chance to win either one of the cups?",

For their part, the Saudi investors weren't keen on making a huge outlay to keep the Brazilian for a couple of seasons, and this disagreement ultimately broke down negotiations.\n\nNow, the latest information suggests that, following the player's desire to stay in Spain, Real Madrid will announce a contract extension (\"for two or three years\"), beyond the current one, which expired in 2027.\n",
