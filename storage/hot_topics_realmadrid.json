        "content": "And yes, I've watched Casillas in his prime years between 2007 and 2012. I've watched Keylor Navas and even Diego Lopez that I actually loved. I think we've always been lucky when it comes to goalkeepers. Even Lunin was brilliant for us last season.\n\nBut honestly I've never felt safe with any other GK like I feel these years with Courtois. Except for his first season, I think Courtois has been the most consistent keeper for us. Casillas, with all respect, used to have some obvious flaws, like dealing with aerial balls and crosses (he was very poor with his feet as well). Navas was a bit inconsistent comparing to Casillas (in his prime) and Courtois, but I have massive respect for him too.\n\nCourtois is just perfect in every possible way.. his 2021/22 season might be the best that I've ever seen for a GK, especially in Champions League. His performance against Liverpool in the final is unmatched, in my opinion. \n\nHe will never play over 700 games for us like Casillas, and he might not end up being the RM keeper with most titles. But in my opinion, he's the best that I've ever seen.. and in my Top 3 GKs of all times (with Buffon + Neuer). I hope he still has 3 or 4 more years in him, because replacing him will be hard.",

You think I\u2019ve never been angry this season? I\u2019ve been angry many times. My relationship is about having relationships with people on the same level, and for that, you have to have respect and be respected, and that\u2019s happened, even in the difficult times. A footballer, before being a footballer, is a person.\"",

        "content": "Bar\u00e7a fan here. Not willing to create any fuss. I\u2019m a football fan in general and love this sport, I\u2019m also curious about certain myths or whether or not they hold any merit. Like for example the claim that Zidane\u2019s three-peat is down more to how excellent of a Madrid side that was rather than his own tactical prowess or whatever \n\nI wasn\u2019t following football as much as I do now back in that era, so any of you who\u2019ve been there week in week out during that time and witnessed his rotations, his tactics, his adaptations to opponents from different European leagues, how true is that claim?\n\nAnd tbf this is not just one myth I wanna debunk, the online discourse is full of nonsense about coaches and a lot of the talk is trying to discredit hard working people out of pure hatred.\n\n",

        "content": "He has what, 30+ goals in all competitions, which is highest by any real madrid player this season, and couple of hattricks too. Was wonderful against city but kinda disappointed in matches like arsenal and Barcelona. \n\nAlso, the team has had balance issues all season long, so that might be affecting his performances too. I am not sure about his relationship with Carlo or others in the team. Haven't heard anything negative. Maybe a bit initially about his penalty disagreement with Vini. But that looks sorted now. \n\nSo, overall, what does this sub think about Mbappe? What can he do to get better, and what the club can do to bring the best out of him?\n\nEdit. Also, what do you guys think about his impact on the more important games? ",
