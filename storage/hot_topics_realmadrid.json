I have read that tickets for games that are not el clasico, Madrid derby etc you can usually get at the stadium the day of. Is that a true statement still? I have seen tickets for sale on sites like StubHub or viagogo, are those sold by season ticket holders? Because I know the tickets don\u2019t usually go on sale until the week of, unless you get the hospitality tickets. I see tickets for around $300 to sit in the middle of the stadium which is what I would be interested in, but is that a fair price to pay? Or should I rather wait until I\u2019m there?\n\nIf anyone has went to a game last season, any input would be appreciated. ",

I don't think another season of mediocre results due to not having the players the manager wants is acceptable for a team like ours. \n\nLook at Liverpool, despite winning the league. They reinforced their squad and it seems they are gonna sign Isak aswell, a player that would be perfect for our club. \n\nimo, it would be a crazy achievement from Xabi if we manage to have an amazing season and I hope that the fans and the board don't blame Xabi cuz he doesnt have the players he wants for the footbal he wants to play.",

With the likely outgoings being Rodrygo.\n\nOr would you rather have SOLD VINI and had the same window that Liverpool has had. Wirtz, Eikitike, Kerkez, Frimpong, Pecsi, possibly Isak and Guehi. And to spice it up sold Rodrygo for 75M to Bayern, and sold Ascensio to Leverkusen for 35M, Lunin to Brentford fo 15M, and Carvajal to Saudi or MLS for 10M. Maybe even loan out Endrick to wherever Nunez might be going. \n\nThat's a lot of outgoings of fan favorite players. I'm curious what the consensus is.",

I also saw him in the 2022 edition, he is clearly a big fan.\nTried to get a picture but he had a bodyguard not allowing any contact from the crowd.\nPS: If I remember correctly, he even had Martin Garrix perform at his wedding. \n",

        "content": "From left to right, we see the Real Madrid squad. Standing in the back are Fernando Redondo, Santiago Ca\u00f1izares, Michael Laudrup, and Pedro \"Koke\" Contreras. Crouching in the front are Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores, Jos\u00e9 Amavisca, and Ismael Urzaiz.\n\nPedro \"Koke\" Contreras and Ismael Urzaiz were academy players who were promoted to the first team that season. Santiago Ca\u00f1izares also came through Real Madrid's academy but had been loaned out to Elche and M\u00e9rida, then sold to Celta, before making his return to the club that year.\n\nRegarding the other players shown: Fernando Redondo was purchased from CD Tenerife, Michael Laudrup joined as a free agent from FC Barcelona, Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores was bought from Valencia CF, and Jos\u00e9 Amavisca was acquired from Real Valladolid.\n\nNot visible in this picture is Ra\u00fal Gonz\u00e1lez, who began the season with the C team. He would be promoted later in the 1994-95 season, making his highly anticipated first-team debut on Matchday 9 against Real Zaragoza.",
