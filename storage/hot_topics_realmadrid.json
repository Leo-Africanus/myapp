Varane was much faster than Dean but Dean is ambidextrous. How would you compare Dean's potential to Varane?

        "content": "This here is one of the reasons why we would probably take two steps forward as a team and 1 step back. Indiscipline. We saw it under Carlo and we are seeing it again. \n\nThis is a footage of Vini just picking up the ball and going for the penalty, He did not ask Mbappe for the penalty. Mbappe is a non confrontational person, and despite being on a hattrick, he let Vini take it. \n\nVini\u2019s penalties even when he scores are terrible, he hits them without any form of technique. Anyone can miss a pen, but some penalties are genuinely bad. If this penalty gimmick continues, it will cost us one day. \n\nThe decision to take the penalty was against the clear instructions of the coach who has made it clear time and time again who the primary taker is. There is no team that makes progress with rebellion and indiscipline.  \n\nThere is still signs of indiscipline in this team and it is obvious where it stems from. \n\nXabi should either put his foot down on many things or the same bad attitude which plagued this team under Carlo Ancelotti will keep repeating itself. It doesn\u2019t matter how many penalties Bayern Munich have and it doesn\u2019t matter how many penalties Kane misses, he continues to take them. This is a clear case of hierarchy and structure.  \n\nFinally, Mbappe is a leader in every sense of the word, his leadership has mostly come from his performances on the pitch and rightly so. His gestures towards teammates have always been with harmonious intentions, but he has to also understand that maintaining harmony cannot happen by contradicting the instructions of the coach who again made it clear in the post match press conference that the designated pk taker is the designated pk taker. \n",
