He has missed several great chances by choosing not to use his weaker foot, instead attempting to reposition his body to shoot with his stronger right foot. This often results in losing the ball or wasting valuable opportunities. I initially believed he was confident with his weaker foot, but it seems I was mistaken.\n\n",

        "content": "With Kroos we were able to quickly switch sides when pressed on one flank, but now we just pass it back to the goalie. I have seen Rudiger attempt long passes to Mbappe which have been effective at points, but he doesn't have the quality to make it a pass that the team can rely on. This usually forces Valverde and Jude deep which kills our attack. Tchouameni in a Kroos position is what is needed with Cama in that holding position to open up that space and Valverde and Jude pressing up top to link with the attackers. This past few games I have noticed that Modric and Ceballos seem to have the opposite effect on this team, instead of playing quick attacks trying to spread the field, they rather play it safe and slow. And the safety is only momentarily because once they lose it up field they have to run back once the press is broken, while when Kroos launches long balls, if they lose it he is already in a defensive position. This is why our team has no fluidity and tires out much earlier than other years. Just look at Barca being more aggressive with long balls. ",

The team had trouble breaking through the last line of Murcia's defense and got punished in the back for lapses in concentration\n\n\ud83d\udd04 46' - 2nd half underway - Loren Aguado comes on for Antonio \n\n\u26bd 52' - GOLLLLL DEL CASTILLA - corner from the right to the near post where Loren Aguado flicks it on to the far post. Quique Ribes is free and manages to slide it into the net from a tight angle to pull one back for the team\n\n\u26bd 61' - goal for Murcia - what a mess, long throw for Murcia that directly leads to a goal - misunderstanding by Rivas and Fran Gonz\u00e1lez and Juan Carlos Real can poke it past Fran in the chaos to make it 3:1 and probably seal the game \n\n\ud83d\udd04 62' - Manuel \u00c1ngel is back for a 2nd time this season, hopefully this time he doesn't reinjure himself again - he comes on for David Ruiz. Also Y\u00e1\u00f1ez is on for Pol Fortuny\n\n\ud83d\udd04 70' - de Llanos on for Gonzalo, who is called up with the first team \n\n73' - de Llanos' shot from just inside the box hits the outside of the post \n\n80' - big chance for V\u00edctor as the ball drops for him on the volley, but his shot is straight at the keeper \n\n88' - almost the 4:1 but their player misses an open net\n\nFT - more would've been possible in this match, but the team conceded very silly and preventable goals and didn't have the urgency and determination to break through Murcia's defense. I'm a bit sick of saying this already, but for yet another matchday, Castilla continue in the relegation zone\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kickoff:** 20:30 CET\n\n**Venue:** Estadio Nueva Condomina, Murcia\n\n**Referee**: David Cambronero Gonz\u00e1lez \n\n**Competition:** Primera Federaci\u00f3n, Grupo 2, Matchday 16\n\n**Viewing options:** \n[FEF TV](https://feftv.com) (subscription - 12.99\u20ac/month)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla XI** (4-2-3-1): Fran Gonz\u00e1lez - Youssef Enr\u00edquez \u2018Yusi\u2019, Mario Rivas, Quique Ribes, David Jim\u00e9nez - Jos\u00e9 Maria Andr\u00e9s \u2018Chema\u2019, Antonio David (46' Loren Aguado) - David Ruiz (62' Manuel \u00c1ngel), Pol Fortuny (62' Dani Y\u00e1\u00f1ez), V\u00edctor Mu\u00f1oz - Gonzalo Garc\u00eda (70' Hugo de Llanos) \n\nBench: Diego Pi\u00f1eiro (GK), Mario de Luis (GK), Diego Aguado. \n\nUnavailable: David Cuenca (pubalgia), Ra\u00fal Asencio (first team call-up), Pablo Ram\u00f3n (ACL tear), Jacobo Ram\u00f3n (muscle injury), Edgar Pujol (?), Andr\u00e9s Campos (?), C\u00e9sar Palacios (ACL tear), Borja Alonso (muscle injury), Loren Z\u00fa\u00f1iga (muscle injury). \n\nCoach: Ra\u00fal\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Castilla last five matches:** DWLDW\n\n**1\u00aa RFEF stats:** 16th | 16pt | 3-7-5 | 23:16\n",

        "title": "Lack of off-ball movement is destroying chance creation ",
        "content": "I've been seeing a discussion on here and social media in general about our lack of creativity and chance creation, which is driving me insane. \n\nFor some reason, a lot of people have this image of creative players as these lazy geniuses who walk around the pitch for 90% of the match and then threads a through ball that goes past 5 defenders into the path of a striker who's just standing there smoking a cigar and puts it in the back of the net. \n\nThe reality is chance creation has just as much to do with the forwards as the creative midfielders. Go watch Ozil's highlights at Madrid, he made a lot of amazing passes, but those passes would never have existed if Ronaldo didn't make the right runs. That doesn't take away from Ozil's brilliance, but it highlights that chance creation is a two-way street. Btw, Ronaldo is still the best player I've ever seen of making runs into the box. \n\nThis is where Mbappe fails to deliver. He either runs offsides (almost about to break a record) or doesn't make any runs at all. There was a moment in the Liverpool match, where Brahim was looking to make a through ball to Mbappe, but he had to delay the pass because Mbappe was standing offside, resulting in us losing possession. That happens way too often. Meanwhile, Rodrygo has a tendency of asking for ball to feet a lot. Vini is the only forward who actually tries to make constant runs behind the defense and has elite movement. \n\nTldr: If our forwards, apart from Vini, don't improve their off-ball runs, we can have Wirtz, Bellingham, Musiala, and Palmer all playing together in the 10 and still create very little ",
