And then there are those players who say \"Rodrygo &gt; Vini.\" Yeah sure. If he ever gets gametime. No disrespect to Rodrygo but what is the point of comparison when the guy is uncertain about his future at the club? Yes he is a great dribbler but Vinicius also performed better than the dogshit he was dropping since the past 6 months. We just have to be patient it's the FIRST MATCH of the season. ",

PSG project took time , so will this. \n\nNow coming to Vini and Trent , vini was tracking back , thats a step forwards , thats enough , one step at a time. Trent was playing in front of the bernabeu crowd for the first time and he has a risk taking role( Passes to break the lines) sometimes it works , sometimes it doesn't. Stop being reactionary and trust. Only time will tell. ",

        "content": "# \"Xabi Alonso has admitted that Trent Alexander-Arnold is not guaranteed to start for Real Madrid, with Dani Carvajal returning to fitness after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament last season. Alexander-Arnold's arrival from Liverpool was Real's most high-profile piece of business this summer, but he may have to split game time with the Spaniard, who came fourth in the Ballon d'Or last year.\" \n\nThoughts? Have you seen enough from Trent to think he should be first-choice right-back? I know he was a free transfer, but still Trent was a high-profile signing. Personally having watched a lot of Liverpool, Trent can definitely be a defensive liability, especially in 1v1s, but offensively he can make attacking passes that very few other players can. I suspect Alonso will make his choice as the season progresses and based on the opponent's style of play/wingers that would matchup against right-back.   \n",

He was outplayed a couple of times but I think he will get better, for now his passes aren\u2019t working like in Liverpool but again I think it will come.\nCarreras: a decent game from him , he got pace and he is aggressive in defending which is beneficial.I think he and Fran gonna give us a solid stack for the season.\nFranco M. : can\u2019t tell much but I can see his potential.\n\n\nSo, Xabi is basically cooking for a month+ and I can see the positives : energy, desire, running, motion.\nStill there is some of Ancelotti\u2019s habits but it will go away. Those habits could be labeled as a con in today\u2019s game , we just need some time.\nI think in 5 matches and throughout them we\u2019ll get to clicking.\n\nLots of \u201cbuts\u201d but I will stay positive.\n\nBTW, happy for Carvajal and it was not good to see him falling down near the end of match.",

He was on the ball more in the second half. I feel like his best position is on the right hand side of the midfield with Guler operating in the centre.

Maybe when I have something on my hand I can look for a business partnership, but right now I just want to play around with the data.\n\nMarkstats have a bot that posts match analytics like one's below.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/feky5tj435kf1.png?width=1694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81063e7527d05fd3bf4a56cc90989a5ff39f7ddb\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/39dl7lj435kf1.png?width=1398&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b171039768be645eb5df5af4d5959d672430bca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0alooxl435kf1.png?width=2486&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63f023c44656de482613698f525a60486439afc1\n\n",

So made a new account and got total 60% off original price lol. \n\nI\u2019m sharing it with a friend of mine since Fancode allows 2 simultaneous streams so it's more cheaper now. Idk if the early bird offer will stay much longer so thought of letting y'all know\n",

LITERALLY. Idc what some of you will say here. ''Oh victim mentality'' ask Mallorca players. Easy.\n\nCopa del Rey: Winners. \n\nSupercopa de Espana: Winners. We beat atletico then barca just like 2 seasons ago.\n\nTell me yours.",
