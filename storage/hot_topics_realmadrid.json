        "title": "Reducing attacking responsibilities on full backs and defensive responsibilities on attackers",
        "content": "We have been struggling defensively this season given the injuries of Dani Carvajal and Eder Militao. Though in the past few matches Carlo has been relying less on the fullbacks in the attacking third which has made us less vulnerable against turnovers. \n\nDEFENCE: I think playing Asencio at the right is the correct decision from Carlo with not having him make overlaping runs as we saw in the match against Valladolid. Now the attack through the right becomes weaker but dont forget that we'll have Rodrygo there on an ideal day. The main problem is Tchouameni as CB. His tackling and ariel ability is good but his awareness is terrible (obviously because he is not a CB). But with Alaba's return and Asencio to cover for him I think it will work.\n\nATTACK: Bellingham has been less involved in tracking back and he's playing as a pseudo stricker which has allowed Mbappe to be more dangerous combined with whoever is in the left wing. Our attackers are best in the world so they can score even with less support from full backs. Bellingham's presence infront of the penalty box has been clinical. Combined with Cebbalos's precise passing, our attack has no issues. I think it is fine that Carlo has placed so much attacking responsibility on our MBVR since they don't need to worry much about defence.\n\nCONCLUSION: It is true that the past few succeses has been against smaller teams but I think these tactics will also work against bigger teams.\n\nTLDR\n1. Less attacking responsibility of fullbacks\n2. Less defencive responsibilities on attackers\n3. Asencio on right\n4. Bellingham's presence infront of the penalty box\n5. Mbapp\u00e9's from\n6. Ceballos's passing accuracy\n7. Alaba's return\n8. Please behave yourself Vini\n9. Please don't play Mendy ",
