He is bossing the midfield in recent games and today he had a perfect game for me as a DM. He did also good against City as a CB. I believe he can play well in both if he keeps up this form but I prefer having him as a DM.\n\nTchou, or as I call him jokingly, Nonchalalentmeni, deserves appreciation and credits. Let's hope he keeps this form. And let's give a small probs to Carlo as now we know the reason why he kept insisting on him.",
