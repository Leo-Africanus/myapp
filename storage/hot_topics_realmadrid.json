        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm a Turkish football fan and have been a Galatasaray supporter all my life. Apart from my club, I\u2019ve also followed Liverpool and, because of my father, had a soft spot for Bar\u00e7a for as long as I can remember. But things started to change when Arda G\u00fcler joined Real Madrid.\n\nAt first, when Arda moved to Fenerbah\u00e7e(our rival) which made me pretty upset. It felt like we\u2019d lost this incredible wonderkid, who has possibility to became the kind of classic number 10 you don\u2019t see much anymore. Still, I love football and I was happy to see such talent would represent our national team.\n\nBut then my man made the move to Real Madrid. Again, it made me a bit sad at first, another \u201crival\u201d team, in a way, but I couldn\u2019t help following him. Since he arrived, I haven\u2019t missed any of his minutes and watched most Real Madrid games over the last two years, always hoping to see him subbed on.\n\nSomewhere along the way, things changed. After Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s goal yesterday, I realized I was actually celebrating like a true Madrid fan. And when I think back to this year\u2019s El Cl\u00e1sico, I was genuinely upset after the loss.\n\nSo I guess it\u2019s official, after being a Gala fan, I can proudly say I\u2019ve become a Madridista. \ud83e\udd0d",

I can understand that r/soccer could have this opinion since he hasn't been scoring much and that sub doesn't watch beyond the PL, CL and clasico/derbies.\n\nBut it is so comical that people on this sub who watch all Madrid matches genuinely think literally anyone else better (mostly Arda). Since Kroos and Modric left, Jude's role has become way deeper and obviou sly that has impacted his scoring and assisting, because his role has transitioned.\n\nArda has been good this season, no doubt. And for nostalgia merchants, might even bring back some Ozil-CR memories.\nBut that is who he is, an Ozil - a pure no. 10 playmaker.\n\nNot mentioning others, because Arda is the one who is SUPPOSEDLY better than Jude according to popular opinion here.\n\nJude on the other hand, can play all positions in the field. Has better finishing, weak-foot heading, tackling, ball control, balance, stamina, positioning and almost equally good passing (Arda may be slightly better at through balls or equal). \n\nJude can do literally everything that any of our other midfielders can do (and do it as well as them). On top of all this, Jude's mentality which enables him to turn around any match on its head, will always give him an edge. At 21, he's the guy mangers, fans, and teammates turn to, when the going gets tough - there's no bigger compliment.\n\n\nThis sub is so dumb and reactionary at times, its infuriating p",

His connection has been feeble with CMs and other Forwards. Reminds me a bit of Endrick and Guler trying to prove a point last season. \n\nIf Rodrygo starts on the RW, that will also be the first time him starting in that position for us this season. \n\nIf Camavinga replaces Tchouameni, you can never know what could happen. \n\nWe might field a setup never tried before vs Barca and that concerns me.

Playing him as Number 10 would be akin to playing Xavi Hernandez as Number 10, sure he can do great and has all the ability but the team would suffer a lot in the midfield and recovery transitions when we will lose the ball. Arda is a machine in releasing very deadly passes between the lines and has that Number 10 technique through and through in turning, feint and making the markers life miserable. He is not good in getting into CM positions to provide a passing option when the pressing is too fast paced. IMO, Jude can still switch with Arda when our wingers have the ball and Jude has to crash the box. Then Arda can go deep. \n\nBut, playing from the back , I truly believe Arda has to stay in front of Jude just behind Mbappe.",

I felt like I saw things that I shouldn't have seen at this match.\n\nI know from a technical standpoint this was a very disappointing victory but I probably would not have had the match go any other way. That was one hell of game to watch as a spectator. But obviously I'd imagine the players never excited to go against the disgrace of a football club that is Getafe and it's unspeakable tactics.",

        "content": "This performance from camavinga is amazing and it's only been the first half. He hasn't done anything wrong so far, and he has also been our most creative player. People are saying we need creativity so guler should come on but cama has made some great through balls so far. Anyway I agree that guler should be on instead of franco. But my point is that a player like cama needs to be in our starting 11. Of course he needs to be healthy for a whole season though that's the only thing holding him back",

        "content": "This setup is perfect for Bar\u00e7a because it lets us morph into a 3-2-2-3 with the ball, 5-3-2 without so we\u2019re dangerous and still solid. Tchouam\u00e9ni runs the show from the back like he did at the Club World Cup, stepping up to plug gaps and calm everything down. It only really works if Trent is matchfit because his passing is second to none. If Dean is fit, he starts over Alaba because of his defensive IQ and passing. I might get some downvotes, but I think this protects us in transition, and gives us set-piece juice. Honestly, the 4-3-3 hasn\u2019t let us hit our ceiling. Let me know what you guys think",
