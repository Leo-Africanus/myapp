Florentino P\u00e9rez just handed every player a \u20ac250,000 bonus for making it to the UCL quarter-finals! \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\udcb8\n\nNormally, we only see bonuses at the end of the season based on trophies, but Don Flo knows what he\u2019s doing. With La Liga, Copa del Rey, and, of course, La 16 still on the table, he\u2019s making sure the squad stays HUNGRY. And let\u2019s not forget the insane schedule ahead with the Club World Cup this summer.\n\nSay what you want, but this man runs the best club in the world like a boss. Hala Madrid y nada m\u00e1s! \ud83d\udd25\u26aa\ud83d\udc51",
