This is 2026, the concept of playing superstars and relying on  the to shine is not feasible. Why ? because :\n\n1) Real madrid does not have a stacked deck like in 2016. way to many overrated and moody at best players. the only decent 'superstar' is Mbappe. And even then he is not good enough to build an ENTIRE system on him alone. \n\n2) buying ready superstars, is too expensive. our Club just ran out of all it's elite veterans that made it seem easy. especially in midfield with modric and kroos.\n\n3) Football has become more intense and more team oriented. people seem to forget that although there were a lot of egos in 2016+ but they were so good at their roles that they synchronized into an unstoppable team. this is definitely not the case for these current players.\n\nAlonso was just disappointed by how immature and very unprofessional these players are. and the rest of the fans will soon know it.",

No patience projects.\n\nSo tell me, in Real Madrid terms:\n\nWho is Vin\u00ed Jr really?\nWho the hell is Jude Bellingham?\nAnd Mbapp\u00e9, or as my brain keeps calling him, Mpaypal?\n\nAt Madrid it used to be simple. You perform, or you fuck off.\n\nI\u2019m not saying these players are bad. I\u2019m saying my standards are completely broken by what I grew up watching. Legends who got destroyed by the press, booed at the Bernab\u00e9u, questioned constantly, and still delivered year after year.\n\nNow it feels like every decent run of form needs to be crowned as a new era.\n\nI want to enjoy this generation. I really do. I want that emotional connection again. That inevitability. That fear opponents used to have before kickoff.\n\nBut honestly? It still feels far away. Like 2028 or 2029 far.\n\nBefore you come at me, take a look at what OG Madrid fans are saying.",

The dude has no clue about football so it's insane that he's the one making sporting decisions, like transfers. This has been going on, and plenty of coaches suffered because of it. Zidane, ultimately, left because of that fact; Ancelotti wasn't given full support literally after winning CL and then his replacement doesn't get full support either.\n\nThe ESL stuff alone should have been enough for a vote of no confidence, but since Perez has spent years buttering up the board and socios to essentially be his mindless drones we have to watch his miserable attempts of forming this stupid competition until he decides he doesn't want to be the president anymore. Which won't happen, so we'll have to wait until he dies.\n\nAll of this stems from Perez. And yet it will continue while the old fart points fingers at everybody else (mainly the coach).",

        "content": "If this Madrid team is to succeed in future, one of the most important steps will be to recognise who in our team are the new Nachos and Vazquezs. \n\nThese are players that are good enough to be at Madrid, to be in match day squads, but not to be regular starters. These are players that can plug in gaps with high quality, or provide quality off the bench, but who are not to be relied upon week in and week out. \n\nWe have fond memories of Joselu because we did not rely on him for goals week in and week out. He was often a substitute or played when some other players were injured, or against specific opposition - and when used in that limited role he excelled. \n\nNacho was always excellent when he would come off the bench or play 5-6 games while someone was injured. But when he played a stretch of 15+ games (when Alaba and Militao were injured) his short comings soon became apparent. \n\nWe need to recognise who those kind of players are in this team soon. I will be controversial and name 2:\n\nFede Valverde and Camavinga. \n\nBoth are utility players that offer good quality in most of the roles they can be deployed in. But not the highest quality required for the best club in the world. Both are supposed to be box to box CMs but they cannot operate under a high quality press. Both cannot organise an attack. \n\nCama is extremely one footed, cannot shoot and rarely provides quality final balls in the last 3rd.\n\nFede cannot dribble and isn't the best passer either so again he can be shut down against quality presses.\n\nSuch limited players cannot be the mainstay of top class midfields, especially of 3 man midfields.\n\nBut there are other players who fall into this category. Ascencio and Fran Garcia being other obvious ones. But until the club recognises who all these players are and brings in the actual quality we need to properly compete, we are going to continue to struggle. ",

Vini is the only player that didn\u2019t lost a farewell message to xabi. He was the most player that wanted xabi out because xabi was the first brave coach that caught up with his bullshit and started subbing him which vini didn\u2019t like. Vinicius plays 1 good game and he dips again for 10 games. Mbappe was saving our asses game after another (almost) im not saying mbappe doesn\u2019t have some flaws but what i know is he was more help than a problem for us more than vini jr. ",

But, it's all irrelevant, because the buck stops with Flo and the team lives and dies by his decisions.\nThis team is more likely to bring in Haaland and play with 5 forwards than buy a defender, and they've always been like this.\nI'm just a long for the ride. What can you do when you were born into a fandom? Leave? It's as much a part of me as the color of my eyes and hair.\nThe team won't change the structure because until they have a financial loss, they don't need to because there talent will eventually push through as it always has and winning erases everything else. This is what Real Madrid is.\nIf you've had enough, this is the time to get off the train. If not, buckle up.",
