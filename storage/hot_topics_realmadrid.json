Xabi has done a lot of hardwork. \nBarcelona is not looking as good as last year. Inigo's Departure and Injuries has left them vulnerable. Raphinha and Lewandowski (their best El Clasico players last year) are also not playing. \n\nLast two El Clasico, we were close, very close to winning. But it's okay, it's in the past. Only thing that matters is tomorrow. We will get the 3 points and shut all of them up. Hala Madrid\ud83e\udd0d\n\n\nEdit : People are still crying in the comments, we don't have this, we don't have that, we won't have stability unless we have this player. BRO WHAT? Do you think Barca is the most stable team? We definitely have an upper hand for this match. If we cannot even win this, what will we do in the away match in may next year?",
