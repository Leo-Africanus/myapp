I just laugh it off mainly cz i'm used to lot of comments about other stuff so everything is been normalized for me, but thinking about other people being in my situation! i'm really afraid they would be hurt deeply, people honestly should watch out for their manners.

        "title": "Is it just me or are middle aged/Elderly women just MEAN? ",
        "content": "Let me start off by saying I know it\u2019s not everyone but haven\u2019t you guys noticed that there is this category of middle age / senior women that are just so rude , mean, bitter and resentful? \n\nI\u2019ve had so many instances where they were completely rude to me and they think that it\u2019s okay because they\u2019re old and should be respected. \n\nFor instances: \n- I used to go and feed the pigeons at this park, I used to do this a lot, never had a problem. Sometimes people enjoy it so much that they ask me to give them or their kids food to give to the pigeons themselves. But then there was this one lady (40-50s) that would just nag me down under the excuse that the pigeons moved the dust in the ground and it affected her. This was only her and also if it was that bad she could\u2019ve easily changed her bench there was plenty of room. Couple weeks later my mom saw her nagging at some poor kid trying to play with his bicycle. \n\n- Another incident at the gym, this was just yesterday, I came early and decided that I was going to stand in the front row during my class. This old lady started interrogating me ( do you study or work , where do you work , what is your job, is it your first time cause I never saw you before ) then she proceeded to say you know we\u2019re a group of ladies that always take the front rows it\u2019s just that most of us are not hear today\u2026 WTH? So ? Was she offended that I stood near her in the front row?\n\n- there was another incident where it turned out much worst . Some lady tried to stop me from using the pool cause I didn\u2019t have a hair cap. Hear me out I know I messed up but 1. My hair cap broke minutes before my class and 2. She herself was not respecting the rule , she didn\u2019t have her goggles on which is also a rule and 3. I came to notice that they were swimming next to a DEAD COCKROACH and I didn\u2019t hear one complaint about that? Which says to me that they don\u2019t care about the hygiene they just care about ruining someone\u2019s day. \nthere are so many other instances, There was one girl at the gym (it\u2019s an all womens gym so we wear what we want ) and they literally started bullying her just because she looked good and in an even worst scenario there was a girl at my gym where 2 old women bullied the hell out of her bc she accidentally took a picture of herself and they were in the frame. She deleted it but they wouldn\u2019t stop. The girl was a 16 year old with apparently some heart disease so she ended up fainting. Her mom and some guy from her family came screaming at the end the police had to get involved cause it got so bad! \n\nMy mom told me that the reason for this resentful and bitter behavior could be cause they feel like they waisted their entire youth and when they see someone that still has time and is enjoying their life they like to suck that out of them. Tbh , I\u2019m starting to believe that to. I even overheard a conversation between them at the gym showers. I kid you not , they were literally talking about how they wasted their life always sacrificing too much for their kids until \u201cnsaw 7althom \u201cand now the kids are gone living their lives while their sick and old , unlike \u201clbnat dial had generation li mazal chadin f rasshom. \u201c\n",
