        "content": "**We wish to inform the r/science community of an article submitted to the subreddit that has since been retracted by the journal. The submission garnered broad exposure on r/science (before being removed for a sensationalized headline) and _significant_ media coverage. Per [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules/#wiki_retractions), the flair on this submission has been updated with \"RETRACTED\". The submission has also been added to our [wiki of retracted submissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/retractions/#wiki_retractions).**\n\n--\n\nReddit Submission: [Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19 - \"100% of patients were virologicaly cured\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/flsj15/hydroxychloroquine_and_azithromycin_as_a/)\n\nThe article [\"Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial\"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105949) has been retracted from the _International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents_ as of December 17, 2024. After [significant concerns](https://www.science.org/content/article/failure-every-level-how-science-sleuths-exposed-massive-ethics-violations-famed-french) were raised about methodological flaws and ethics violations, the journal co-owners, Elsevier and the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (ISAC), have jointly made the decision to retract the paper.\n\nAn investigation conducted by an impartial field expert acting in the role of an independent Publishing Ethics Advisor concluded the following points constituted cause for retraction:\n\n* The journal has been unable to confirm whether any of the patients for this study were accrued before ethical approval had been obtained.\n* The journal has not been able to establish whether all patients could have entered into the study in time for the data to have been analysed and included in the manuscript prior to its submission on the 20th March 2020, nor whether all patients were enrolled in the study upon admission as opposed to having been hospitalised for some time before starting the treatment described in the article. Additionally, the journal has not been able to establish whether there was equipoise between the study patients and the control patients.\n* The journal has not been able to establish whether the subjects in this study should have provided informed consent to receive azithromycin as part of the study.\n\nMedia Coverage:\n\n* French Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics: [Retraction of the Gautret et al. study: a dark page in COVID-19 research finally turned](https://sfpt-fr.org/vie-de-la-sfpt/communiques-sfpt/2097-retractation-de-letude-gautret-et-coll-hydroxychloroquine-azithromycine)\n* Science: [Infamous paper that popularized unproven COVID-19 treatment finally retracted](https://www.science.org/content/article/infamous-paper-popularized-unproven-covid-19-treatment-finally-retracted)\n* USA Today: [Study retracted years after it set off an infamous COVID-19 treatment scandal](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/12/17/hydroxychloroquine-study-covid-19-retracted-trump/77051671007/)\n\n--\n\nThis retraction is highly controversial since it involves the disgraced French scientist Didier Raoult (See our [recent AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1et0yyj/we_are_science_sleuths_who_exposed_potentially/) with the science sleuths who exposed the ethics violations at his research institute).\n\n--\n\nShould you encounter a submission on r/science that has been retracted, please notify the moderators [via Modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fscience&amp;subject=Retraction).",
