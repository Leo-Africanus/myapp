        "content": "The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2025 was awarded to [Mary E. Brunkow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_E._Brunkow), [Fred Ramsdell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Ramsdell), and [Shimon Sakaguchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_Sakaguchi) **\"for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.\"**\n\n* [Official Press Release](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2025/press-release/)\n* [Popular Information](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2025/popular-information/)\n* [Scientific Explanation of the Award](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2025/advanced-information/)\n* [Video of the Prize Announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUut_3YYD6s)\n\n&gt;Every day, our immune system protects us from thousands of different microbes trying to invade our bodies. These all have different appearances, and many have developed similarities with human cells as a form of camouflage. So how does the immune system determine what it should attack and what it should defend?\n\n&gt;Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi are awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2025 for their fundamental discoveries relating to peripheral immune tolerance. The laureates identified the immune system\u2019s security guards, *regulatory T cells*, which prevent immune cells from attacking our own body.\n\n&gt;\u201cTheir discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,\u201d says Olle K\u00e4mpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.\n\n&gt;Shimon Sakaguchi was swimming against the tide in 1995, when he made the first key discovery. At the time, many researchers were convinced that immune tolerance only developed due to potentially harmful immune cells being eliminated in the thymus, through a process called *central tolerance*. Sakaguchi showed that the immune system is more complex and discovered a previously unknown class of immune cells, which protect the body from autoimmune diseases.\n\n&gt;Mary Brunkow and Fred Ramsdell made the other key discovery in 2001, when they presented the explanation for why a specific mouse strain was particularly vulnerable to autoimmune diseases. They had discovered that the mice have a mutation in a gene that they named *Foxp3*. They also showed that mutations in the human equivalent of this gene cause a serious autoimmune disease, IPEX.\n\n&gt;Two years after this, Shimon Sakaguchi was able to link these discoveries. He proved that the *Foxp3* gene governs the development of the cells he identified in 1995. These cells, now known as regulatory T cells, monitor other immune cells and ensure that our immune system tolerates our own tissues.\n\n&gt;The laureates\u2019 discoveries launched the field of peripheral tolerance, spurring the development of medical treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases. This may also lead to more successful transplantations. Several of these treatments are now undergoing clinical trials.",

        "content": "We wish to inform the [**r/science**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/) community of an article submitted to the subreddit that has since been retracted by the journal. The submission garnered broad exposure on [**r/science**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/) and significant media coverage. Per [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules/#wiki_retractions), the flair on this submission has been updated with \"RETRACTED\". The submission has also been added to our [wiki of retracted submissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/retractions/#wiki_retractions).\n\n\\--\n\nReddit Submission: [Pre-infection deficiency of vitamin D is associated with increased disease severity and mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/sk1owo/preinfection_deficiency_of_vitamin_d_is/)\n\nThe article [\"Pre-infection 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels and association with severity of COVID-19 illness\"](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263069) has [been retracted](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331693) from *PLOS One* as of September 8, 2025. After methodological concerns were raised shortly after publication in 2022, the article was recently reassessed by an independent member of the *PLOS One* Editorial Board. They determined that the analyses were inadequate to test the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels at the time of infection and severity of COVID-19 illness.\n\nSince this flaw prevents testing of the hypothesis and calls into question the reported conclusions, the *PLOS One* Editors issued the retraction. Fifteen of the study's eighteen authors disputed the retraction.\n\n* Retraction Watch: [Authors defend retracted paper on vitamin D and COVID-19 called \u2018deeply bizarre\u2019 by critic](https://retractionwatch.com/2025/09/25/authors-defend-retracted-paper-on-vitamin-d-and-covid-19-critic-called-deeply-bizarre/)\n\n\\--\n\nShould you encounter a submission on [r/science](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/) that has been retracted, please notify the moderators [via Modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fscience&amp;subject=Retraction).",
