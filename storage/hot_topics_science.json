The submission garnered broad exposure on Reddit and significant media coverage because of its sensational claims. Per [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules/#wiki_retractions), the flair on this submission has been updated with \"RETRACTED\". The submission has also been added to our [wiki of retracted submissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/retractions/#wiki_retractions).**\n\n-- \n\nReddit Submission: [Evidence that a cosmic impact destroyed ancient city in the Jordan Valley. The shock of the explosion over Tall el-Hammam was enough to level the city. The distribution of bones indicated \"extreme disarticulation and skeletal fragmentation in nearby humans.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/przjy7/evidence_that_a_cosmic_impact_destroyed_ancient/)\n\nThe article [\"A Tunguska sized airburst destroyed Tall el-Hammam a Middle Bronze Age city in the Jordan Valley near the Dead Sea\"](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-97778-3) has [been retracted](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-99265-5) from _Scientific Reports_ as of April 24, 2025. Following publication, significant methodological concerns [were raised](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-08216-x) that [undermined](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-98362-9) the conclusion that an airburst event destroyed the Middle Bronze Age city of Tall el-Hammam. Two post-publication corrections were issued to address the inappropriate manipulation of several dozen figures in the article before ultimately being retracted by the Editors of the journal. According to the retraction notice, all the authors that responded the journal's correspondence opposed the retraction.\n\n* Retraction Watch: [Sodom comet paper to be retracted two years after editor\u2019s note acknowledging concerns](https://retractionwatch.com/2025/04/23/sodom-comet-paper-to-be-retracted-two-years-after-editors-note-acknowledging-concerns/)\n* [PubPeer Discussion](https://pubpeer.com/publications/37B87CAC48DE4BC98AD40E00330143)\n\n-- \n\nShould you encounter a submission on r/science that has been retracted, please notify the moderators [via Modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fscience&amp;subject=Retraction).",
