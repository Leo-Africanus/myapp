        "content": "The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2025 was awarded to [Joel Mokyr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Mokyr) \"for having identified the prerequisites for sustained growth through technological progress\" and the other half jointly to [Philippe Aghion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Aghion) and [Peter Howitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Howitt_(economist)) \"for the theory of sustained growth through creative destruction.\"\n\n* [Official Press Release](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2025/press-release/)\n* [Popular Information](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2025/popular-information/)\n* [Scientific Explanation of the Award](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2025/advanced-information/)\n* [Video of the Prize Announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajZObplJ8U)\n\n&gt;Technology advances rapidly and affects us all, with new products and production methods replacing old ones in a never-ending cycle. This is the basis for sustained economic growth, which results in a better standard of living, health and quality of life for people around the globe.\n\n&gt;However, this was not always the case. Quite the opposite \u2013 stagnation was the norm throughout most of human history. Despite important discoveries now and again, which sometimes led to improved living conditions and higher incomes, growth always eventually levelled off.\n\n&gt;Joel Mokyr used historical sources as one means to uncover the causes of sustained growth becoming the new normal. He demonstrated that if innovations are to succeed one another in a self-generating process, we not only need to know that something works, but we also need to have scientific explanations for why. The latter was often lacking prior to the industrial revolution, which made it difficult to build upon new discoveries and inventions. He also emphasised the importance of society being open to new ideas and allowing change.\n\n&gt;Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt also studied the mechanisms behind sustained growth. In an article from 1992, they constructed a mathematical model for what is called creative destruction: when a new and better product enters the market, the companies selling the older products lose out. The innovation represents something new and is thus creative. However, it is also destructive, as the company whose technology becomes pass\u00e9 is outcompeted.\n\n&gt;In different ways, the laureates show how creative destruction creates conflicts that must be managed in a constructive manner. Otherwise, innovation will be blocked by established companies and interest groups that risk being put at a disadvantage.\n\n&gt;\u201cThe laureates\u2019 work shows that economic growth cannot be taken for granted. We must uphold the mechanisms that underly creative destruction, so that we do not fall back into stagnation,\u201d says John Hassler, Chair of the Committee for the prize in economic sciences.",
