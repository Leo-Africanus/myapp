        "content": "We wish to inform the [**r/science**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/) community of an article submitted to the subreddit that has since been retracted by the journal. The submission garnered broad exposure on [**r/science**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/) and significant media coverage. Per [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules/#wiki_retractions), the flair on this submission has been updated with \"RETRACTED\". The submission has also been added to our [wiki of retracted submissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/retractions/#wiki_retractions).\n\n\\--\n\nReddit Submission: [Pre-infection deficiency of vitamin D is associated with increased disease severity and mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/sk1owo/preinfection_deficiency_of_vitamin_d_is/)\n\nThe article [\"Pre-infection 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels and association with severity of COVID-19 illness\"](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263069) has [been retracted](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331693) from *PLOS One* as of September 8, 2025. After methodological concerns were raised shortly after publication in 2022, the article was recently reassessed by an independent member of the *PLOS One* Editorial Board. They determined that the analyses were inadequate to test the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels at the time of infection and severity of COVID-19 illness.\n\nSince this flaw prevents testing of the hypothesis and calls into question the reported conclusions, the *PLOS One* Editors issued the retraction. Fifteen of the study's eighteen authors disputed the retraction.\n\n* Retraction Watch: [Authors defend retracted paper on vitamin D and COVID-19 called \u2018deeply bizarre\u2019 by critic](https://retractionwatch.com/2025/09/25/authors-defend-retracted-paper-on-vitamin-d-and-covid-19-critic-called-deeply-bizarre/)\n\n\\--\n\nShould you encounter a submission on [r/science](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/) that has been retracted, please notify the moderators [via Modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fscience&amp;subject=Retraction).",
