        "content": "The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2025 was awarded to [Susumu Kitagawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susumu_Kitagawa), [Richard Robson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Robson_(chemist)), and [Omar M. Yaghi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_M._Yaghi) \"for the development of metal-organic frameworks.\"\n\n* [Official Press Release](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2025/press-release/)\n* [Popular Information](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2025/popular-information/)\n* [Scientific Explanation of the Award](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2025/advanced-information/)\n* [Video of the Prize Announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d02ONEXWkc)\n\n&gt;Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson and Omar Yaghi are awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2025. They have developed a new form of molecular architecture. In their constructions, metal ions function as cornerstones that are linked by long organic (carbon-based) molecules. Together, the metal ions and molecules are organised to form crystals that contain large cavities. These porous materials are called metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOF). By varying the building blocks used in the MOFs, chemists can design them to capture and store specific substances. MOFs can also drive chemical reactions or conduct electricity.\n\n&gt;\u201cMetal\u2013organic frameworks have enormous potential, bringing previously unforeseen opportunities for custom-made materials with new functions,\u201d says Heiner Linke, Chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry.\n\n&gt;It all started in 1989, when Richard Robson tested utilising the inherent properties of atoms in a new way. He combined positively charged copper ions with a four-armed molecule; this had a chemical group that was attracted to copper ions at the end of each arm.\n\n&gt;When they were combined, they bonded to form a well-ordered, spacious crystal. It was like a diamond filled with innumerable cavities.\n\n&gt;Robson immediately recognised the potential of his molecular construction, but it was unstable and collapsed easily. However, Susumu Kitagawa and Omar Yaghi provided this building method with a firm foundation; between 1992 and 2003 they made, separately, a series of revolutionary discoveries. Kitagawa showed that gases can flow in and out of the constructions and predicted that MOFs could be made flexible. Yaghi created a very stable MOF and showed that it can be modified using rational design, giving it new and desirable properties.\n\n&gt;Following the laureates\u2019 groundbreaking discoveries, chemists have built tens of thousands of different MOFs. Some of these may contribute to solving some of humankind\u2019s greatest challenges, with applications that include separating PFAS from water, breaking down traces of pharmaceuticals in the environment, capturing carbon dioxide or harvesting water from desert air.",

        "content": "The Nobel Prize in Physics 2025 was awarded to [John Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Clarke_(physicist)), [Michel H. Devoret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Devoret), and [John M. Martinis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_M._Martinis) **\"for the discovery of macroscopic quantum mechanical tunnelling and energy quantisation in an electric circuit.\"**\n\n* [Official Press Release](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2025/press-release/)\n* [Popular Information](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2025/popular-information/)\n* [Scientific Explanation of the Award](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2025/advanced-information/)\n* [Video of the Prize Announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9FUkAis62s)\n\n&gt;Quantum mechanics allows a particle to move straight through a barrier, using a process called tunnelling. As soon as large numbers of particles are involved, quantum mechanical effects usually become insignificant. The laureates\u2019 experiments demonstrated that quantum mechanical properties can be made concrete on a macroscopic scale.\n\n&gt;In 1984 and 1985, **John Clarke**, **Michel H. Devoret** and **John M. Martinis** conducted a series of experiments with an electronic circuit built of superconductors, components that can conduct a current with no electrical resistance. In the circuit, the superconducting components were separated by a thin layer of non-conductive material, a setup known as a Josephson junction. By refining and measuring all the various properties of their circuit, they were able to control and explore the phenomena that arose when they passed a current through it. Together, the charged particles moving through the superconductor comprised a system that behaved as if they were a single particle that filled the entire circuit.\n\n&gt;This macroscopic particle-like system is initially in a state in which current flows without any voltage. The system is trapped in this state, as if behind a barrier that it cannot cross. In the experiment the system shows its quantum character by managing to escape the zero-voltage state through tunnelling. The system\u2019s changed state is detected through the appearance of a voltage.\n\n&gt;The laureates could also demonstrate that the system behaves in the manner predicted by quantum mechanics \u2013 it is quantised, meaning that it only absorbs or emits specific amounts of energy.\n\n&gt;\u201cIt is wonderful to be able to celebrate the way that century-old quantum mechanics continually offers new surprises. It is also enormously useful, as quantum mechanics is the foundation of all digital technology,\u201d says Olle Eriksson, Chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics.\n\n&gt;The transistors in computer microchips are one example of the established quantum technology that surrounds us. This year\u2019s Nobel Prize in Physics has provided opportunities for developing the next generation of quantum technology, including quantum cryptography, quantum computers, and quantum sensors.",
