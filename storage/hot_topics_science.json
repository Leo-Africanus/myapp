Martinis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_M._Martinis) **\"for the discovery of macroscopic quantum mechanical tunnelling and energy quantisation in an electric circuit.\"**\n\n* [Official Press Release](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2025/press-release/)\n* [Popular Information](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2025/popular-information/)\n* [Scientific Explanation of the Award](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2025/advanced-information/)\n* [Video of the Prize Announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9FUkAis62s)\n\n&gt;Quantum mechanics allows a particle to move straight through a barrier, using a process called tunnelling. As soon as large numbers of particles are involved, quantum mechanical effects usually become insignificant. The laureates\u2019 experiments demonstrated that quantum mechanical properties can be made concrete on a macroscopic scale.\n\n&gt;In 1984 and 1985, **John Clarke**, **Michel H. Devoret** and **John M. Martinis** conducted a series of experiments with an electronic circuit built of superconductors, components that can conduct a current with no electrical resistance. In the circuit, the superconducting components were separated by a thin layer of non-conductive material, a setup known as a Josephson junction. By refining and measuring all the various properties of their circuit, they were able to control and explore the phenomena that arose when they passed a current through it. Together, the charged particles moving through the superconductor comprised a system that behaved as if they were a single particle that filled the entire circuit.\n\n&gt;This macroscopic particle-like system is initially in a state in which current flows without any voltage. The system is trapped in this state, as if behind a barrier that it cannot cross. In the experiment the system shows its quantum character by managing to escape the zero-voltage state through tunnelling. The system\u2019s changed state is detected through the appearance of a voltage.\n\n&gt;The laureates could also demonstrate that the system behaves in the manner predicted by quantum mechanics \u2013 it is quantised, meaning that it only absorbs or emits specific amounts of energy.\n\n&gt;\u201cIt is wonderful to be able to celebrate the way that century-old quantum mechanics continually offers new surprises. It is also enormously useful, as quantum mechanics is the foundation of all digital technology,\u201d says Olle Eriksson, Chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics.\n\n&gt;The transistors in computer microchips are one example of the established quantum technology that surrounds us. This year\u2019s Nobel Prize in Physics has provided opportunities for developing the next generation of quantum technology, including quantum cryptography, quantum computers, and quantum sensors.",

        "content": "The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2025 was awarded to [Mary E. Brunkow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_E._Brunkow), [Fred Ramsdell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Ramsdell), and [Shimon Sakaguchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_Sakaguchi) **\"for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.\"**\n\n* [Official Press Release](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2025/press-release/)\n* [Popular Information](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2025/popular-information/)\n* [Scientific Explanation of the Award](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2025/advanced-information/)\n* [Video of the Prize Announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUut_3YYD6s)\n\n&gt;Every day, our immune system protects us from thousands of different microbes trying to invade our bodies. These all have different appearances, and many have developed similarities with human cells as a form of camouflage. So how does the immune system determine what it should attack and what it should defend?\n\n&gt;Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi are awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2025 for their fundamental discoveries relating to peripheral immune tolerance. The laureates identified the immune system\u2019s security guards, *regulatory T cells*, which prevent immune cells from attacking our own body.\n\n&gt;\u201cTheir discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,\u201d says Olle K\u00e4mpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.\n\n&gt;Shimon Sakaguchi was swimming against the tide in 1995, when he made the first key discovery. At the time, many researchers were convinced that immune tolerance only developed due to potentially harmful immune cells being eliminated in the thymus, through a process called *central tolerance*. Sakaguchi showed that the immune system is more complex and discovered a previously unknown class of immune cells, which protect the body from autoimmune diseases.\n\n&gt;Mary Brunkow and Fred Ramsdell made the other key discovery in 2001, when they presented the explanation for why a specific mouse strain was particularly vulnerable to autoimmune diseases. They had discovered that the mice have a mutation in a gene that they named *Foxp3*. They also showed that mutations in the human equivalent of this gene cause a serious autoimmune disease, IPEX.\n\n&gt;Two years after this, Shimon Sakaguchi was able to link these discoveries. He proved that the *Foxp3* gene governs the development of the cells he identified in 1995. These cells, now known as regulatory T cells, monitor other immune cells and ensure that our immune system tolerates our own tissues.\n\n&gt;The laureates\u2019 discoveries launched the field of peripheral tolerance, spurring the development of medical treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases. This may also lead to more successful transplantations. Several of these treatments are now undergoing clinical trials.",
