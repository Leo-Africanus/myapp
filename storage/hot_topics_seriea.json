Yet unfortunately I'm unable to figure out so far. Could you please share any info that you have (better with source if available)?\n\nSpecifically, I'm thinking of these scenarios (comments concerning any other scenario would also be appreciated for sure):\n\n1. Official Serie A matches. (Am I right to assume it is the highest quality \"FIFA\u00ae Quality Pro\" footballs that are used here?)\n2. Pre-match training sessions.\n3. Training sessions within clubs (or maybe they use equipment from their respective sponsors, not necessarily the Serie A football?)",
